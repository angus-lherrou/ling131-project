A. B. C. Los Angeles county of cumulus station\nOn a year over year basis that compares with the consumer price index gain a year over year of just two point nine percent\nI mentioned existing home sales or they were slightly lower in July by seven tenths of one percent to basically a five and a third million union annual rate that's the lowest since February of two thousand sixteen\nSo um we look at the figures across the board we see that\nWe could stay steady we could see steady ... in the housing market but\nThose earlier times when we saw some really sizeable increases there not happening right now just not happening median existing home prices\nDid very very well Europe for a year they're a four point five percent interesting disparity there the median new home sales price is down one percent\nIn the last year but the median existing home prices up four and a half percent and I think that\nProbably one of the factors there is the scarcity of existing homes for sale could be a factor in that four and a half percent year over year game which is better than the two point nine percent consumer price index increase over the past year\nSo all of that going on out there with keeping an eye on all of this of course as we monitor the economy I Would say the monitor a monitoring of the economy right now would dictate I'm saying that it's okay it's okay we have a year over year\nReal gross domestic product growth rate on the books\nAs of the currents figures that are available of two point eight percent that's a good figure so I'm hopefully that will continue\nOur toll free lie money hungry at nine three four twenty to Twenty one that is or contact number let's get mark on the line in Naperville markets you return\nIdol Bob thank you for taking my call I I have an idea for protecting Social Security benefits\nAre and this idea is that if we can leave out of an add to go to them by which half the lawyers or something of the employer contribution to Social Security employee goes into a photo wife Kate tight garlic\nAnd invested in a target fun 'cause that's what they talking about the age of ... employees are on the condition that that money could not be touched retirement\nUm I'm just wondering if something like this kind of how to work\nI just don't know where the votes would come from because Congress has been unwilling\nTo allow the privatization of anything related to Social Security George W. Bush the president made a proposal right to to invest a small portion of the Social Security fund in the stock market if that had been done\nThat would have done extremely well\nBecause he made that proposal when the stock market was at lower levels much lower levels\nFor a door during his two terms so if they had taken up that idea the place a small portion in the stock market which would have to be indexed\nThen uh that money would have done extremely well unfortunately Congress which can't seem to agree or how many days in the week there are any more they're just in case there simply dysfunctional they're incapable of govern\nWhat maybe that was a condition on talking about that that money cannot be touch Social Security to comment age and maybe the concern that passed laws\nThat money has got to be touch prior to that is at risk and the stock market but also this money couldn't be invested and I'm ... so the U.S government\nUh or twenty five or\n... what should be it would give certain uh returns\nWell they all ready invest a lot of the money in it and they already invest the money in the equivalent of us treasuries right now they do that right now\nBut I thought it's all I oh you I thought that\nMoney and all of that uh yeah but that they consider it the equivalent\nBecause that's the rate of interested earns is the equivalent it ... it it earns the market rate of interest one has invested yes you're yes you're right there's no money there the whole thing is a\n... year right now because you know why because all the money is getting old more and more and eventually all of the money is getting paid out of the the people who are currently working paying Social Security tax and then they take that money and they pay it after the beneficiaries and that's where we're headed\nAnd so the whole thing is a under the unified budget\nThere's no question about it the whole concept of a trust fund with money out there\nYeah it's I always use you're absolutely correct but\nI don't see any any one first of all I don't see any one politically in Washington stepping up on this issue it's become the third rail of politics and they don't want to touch it they don't want to cut Medicare either\nA in terms of making those fiscally responsible they don't want to go near it on the other hand uh I don't see the votes in Congress to get something done on this because they just are well they're totally dysfunctional and they've proven time and again\nThemselves they prove that themselves\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one it is on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago although at\nAll of this that and Chicago I got a a large portion of my money and money markets that are not covered by the icy and I'm trying to find a that is a problem the reason that I have the money and money market account\nOr is that I'm not sure how long I'm going to live\nAnd I don't want to tie up my money you know a like a CD for a longer period of time or or even a shorter period of time\nSo that it would be a hindrance to my ears and I'm Wondering if there would be a problem with keeping it and money markets at this point in time\nI think if you're with quality companies companies like a vanguard companies like fidelity any of the high quality companies I can only speak for myself I don't have a problem having money and money market funds because I'm worried about it\nUh but I mean you would have to speak for yourself on that issue as to whether you're comfortable with it or there is another way for you to do this which is to just do in the short term treasury bills which could be liquidated or any time\nOkay\nYou could use for example if you owned Ninety One day treasury bills three months Richard bills\nThan a those monies can be liquidated at any time and they're perfectly safe or and or not only that the interest is exempt from um the state and local tax so that's certainly something for you to consider you would not for example you would not have to pay\nA the Illinois state income tax on interest you earned on a treasury bill so that might be an increased incentive for you to take a look at like ... or something like that and the rates have been increasing as the Federal Reserve continues to increase short term rates\nAnd so that certainly is something else it's going on\nAnd I do appreciate the call\nAnd that was an interesting a speech that the fed chair Jerome Powell gave at Jackson Hole Wyoming this week I Hope many of you had an opportunity to\nUh read parts of it or even more that you've had a chance to go to the grand teeth odds and in Jackson Hole Wyoming but uh there's no question about it that he has made it clear\nThat uh he's going to continue to watch inflation but he's not particularly upset about inflation right now\nAh and he certainly has made it clear that he's going to gradually increase short term interest rates until they get to some level of\nNormal and um he he doesn't seem to be flourishing in any way from the the program that he has set forth which he basically inherited from\nA from a chair Yellen his predecessor which is to gradually increased rates of interest as the economy grows and as employment grows and as inflation remains manageable I think that would be a synopsis of his view\nAnd I think it's a view that's generally accepted at this juncture\nIf you'd like to join us on the toll free line we'd like to hear from you one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that's our number one eight hundred Ninety three\nA new

Leanne welcome to money ...\nThank you for taking my call\nI had a question for you if I could and it has to do with model portfolio number three I have it through vanguard and I was looking after that they they had some more money at the onset of that and it looks like I don't know if I'm allowed to name any of the ... and that are not\nWell a one or two just asked me your your question a generic form\nOkay sounds good on one of them it looks like when I looked it up last week at vanguard and I was looking at the ... ... and so if I take that and double it kind of take it through the end it here and that would be adjusted return it looks like I'd be better off going into the\nPrime money market rather than going into that and then the second part of that question was that the FCC eh the the what the what did that have to do with the annual return how did that relate\nWell they're all they're all love your differently and uh so\nYou know if as long as you're consistent I think that's probably the most important part of it as long as you're consistent with how you're doing it but\nUh it depends which one you're looking at and ah it can be very complicated known how these deals are constructed because you have current field you have the maturity of as easy a day of distribution deal\nI mean it just goes on and on but I Would say as far as the money market fund component of that particular portfolio the yield on that right now is over two percent and I think for someone that just wants to have a very very simplified portfolio as I've said before you can use that money market fund\nOr you can use a CD ladder\nNow if you're going to use the ... or you could use for example equal amounts of the three six nine and twelve month CD\nAnd by doing that you'd have a very short average duration\nYou know our average duration a portfolio is less than one year your average duration\nOn a three six nine twelve month she would be even less than a than the one that's in the portfolio which is already over one year\nAnd that would be another way that you could look at it in other words there are various ways in a rising interest rate environment that you can go depends on how\nA wrist wrist tolerant you are if you're not risk tolerated at all then the CD letter fully FDIC insured is risk free is held the majority and that certainly is something to consider as well and uh\nOn the market fund is also something to consider and we've included that as part of that portfolio let's get out to the great cayenne us radio Denver one is your return welcome\nFacts five for as for the time I waited for your ...\nThank you for holding on I Do appreciate your patience thinking\nIf I have two daughters my a fourteen year old I Need to do a college five twenty nine plan for\nAnd I have a hundred thousand set aside for that I'd like to know what would that make up for lost time what would be the highest turn\nCollege five hundred I I Would recommend and then I have a twenty eight year old who she just finished her medical school and I'd like to I heard in the long term off IRA find which would you prefer\nWell I think that uh for the twenty eight year old certainly getting started a I Would look at something or with broad diversification and low expenses\nI Would recommend or that you consider starting with something like either the fidelity sport in total stock market index for the then go to the stock market index they both have extremely low expense ratio is a minimal I Would consider the minimal not significant\nAnd they give you a broad diversification they give you tax efficiency so I think the total stock market index that either one of those out this would be a good place to start\nThank you that's the only world\nFor the fourteen year old where it's a little dicey because you're going to be writing college tuition checks in about four years so you have to be aware of that as well and so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio of by that I mean I Want to have some liquid assets\nSome liquidity I mean in that portfolio\nOr at least by the time we get to the point where we're writing commission checked we can't make four year for cash so in the market at least I can I don't have a four year forecast on the market uh so uh\nYou know you have to consider it if you made a four year forecast on the market\nIn Nineteen Ninety eight it probably would not have been they asked him the five hundred being an eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand\nSo making a four year for kids somewhere the market's going to be as as a ... a activity but uh certainly I think at this point you have some time here where you should be able to um to hopefully benefit\nBehalf the victim yes September eleventh and know that that was damp down yeah I I mean I'm One of the people that wanted information belief that the death of the Saudi Arabian government absolutely ... and ... I really would like the answers on that and yet at the you know conventional\nWisdom is that they helped President Obama with Syria you're helping against Iran that they are a strategic ally in the area in terms of the effort against Islamic terror but I'm not sure I'm buying that I'm not you know because they sure looked like they were part of the Islamic tear\nDown the ... power so I never understood that was what I was one of a George W.

I don't I can hang out with somebody who's a Trump supporters don't think I could sleep with them can we draw the line [laughter]\nWell here's the thing about it there are people who are having a problem finding a a significant other yeah because they are Trump supporters and there's a new ad that's coming out for Trump's singles make Beatty great again because people locked they've just flows out of there are supporter\nUh-huh actually you know what's funny to me um my girlfriend's on dating websites I'm On I don't date but I'm not I'm not a website but I Am a long story um she will meet guys and it's one of the ... she puts it in her bio that she's very critical of Trump She will not date anyone and\nUh you know the pickings get slim after a certain age so they keep hooking up with all these like super wealthy really ugly do I'm like come on she's so hot she was in playboy for God's sake her ex husband to major league baseball players superstars\nI go do you can't like what like current I make her own money were not into dating guys that are rich because the rich I think in gross and so some of them they're like here's my jet and she's sending pictures of herself and they're sending pictures of their jet that's always a bad sign right and then you know they'll go for a drink and they won't mention anything politically\nBut it'll come in the ... but then it comes up when they're having cocktails\nAnd as soon as she hears it she's like because her mother was from ... now my mother was an immigrant and I see what he's doing with kids in cages it ain't happening or not\nIt's a turnoff socialism rank takes over where the heart may go one way or the okay if Bradley Cooper came up and he's like I'm On a date you and then I was like yeah okay well that's fine tell the supermodel wife about it\nBut and then we I'd have to sleep with them first and then he would tell me if he said he was a Trump supporter I probably would have amnesia a lack of sleep with them and the\nAnd then the next day I'd leave and say what I'm saying I\nIt might be worth it for that one hour I could just walk away but I I I hear\nAll the time or there's people husband and wife belong to a different political party\nWho's been coupled a James Carville and their ... yeah yeah so they it it can work out work will get Philips than I ever day three hours a day but again I don't sleep with them [laughter] definitely not as type\nBe interesting to hear from other listeners amid they live right whether or not they would have a problem dating someone\nMaybe they could call us on the drive on maybe major overdrive on but yeah I Love to I'd love to hear maybe some people are married to others you know to people that are on the other side the right\nMarried early there's a need because this app is where people who are Trump supporters who are having a difficult time finding a soul mate\nWell that's a shame because Donald junior was separated for what three weeks out of luck Kimberly Illinois yeah left his wife and five kids for [laughter] yeah it is\nA great guess what Dr Drew and more ... will return to me they lived tomorrow and uh it was a pleasure so we have for Dr germ\n[noise]\nRemember that thing your wife and you couldn't live\nWith for a day you can\nAnd she doesn't even have to know about it\nYou're not shot at a grand is coming up into second so even\nThe ...\nOrange County cumulus station [noise] [laughter]\n\nWell you could win one\nAnd you'll hear you hear this bigger but like the homes being shelled yeah and then you wake up in the morning and you look outside and the pool of my reason [laughter]\nThose winds were no joke [noise]\nWe've got some breaking news involving this missing journalist we just you know I was filling in a little bit on the last show and a Lawrence Yvonne had some people to talk about it with and I\nHow an interrogation go wrong John well let me go ahead and you asked that question to Bob customs teeny because I'm a little perplexed myself up high or low\nOr John uh Jillian of CNN is reporting that the Saudis are about to admit they're going to admit\nThat you ... ... ... um died while inside the consulate perhaps some ... long uh this is the uh uh a may ... certainly what exploration they're going to be\nBut it seemed inevitable that they might have to admit that he went into the consulate and never came out\nThere was no reason to believe that he had come out in the Turkish government was saying that cash Cokie was\nThe ... chief [laughter] I'm trying to go without pronunciation of this by the way or that he was a wedding was interrogated perhaps a and a was killed in some way\nBecause the Turks even if they have a a recording audio recording at least on the events that team may have triggered on his own cell phone when he went into the consulate supposedly presumably to get paperwork for his pending marriage\nSo the bottom line is and and they they sort of have they been cornered so now they're saying okay it was an interrogation gone wrong but the bottom line is I think we all can agree they they were probably\nHired to kill him by the prince or told white how can we do even come with those tools with Fifteen of you of course this is what they have to say now that this this recording is\nAllegedly out there they have to sort of come up with something a ... and the truth is I'm\n... I guess we'll find out more do you think the recording will ever become public I mean ... was it I don't believe it was a waterboarding gone wrong I don't believe it's ... I think you'd think they'd the intent was well to kill him and chop them up\nHow about this worse the body if it was an accident then there should be a body somewhere right can called Craig's\nWell well the Turks have speculated that his he was dismembered after being killed or and so the Turks also ah have been allowed or we're going to be allowed and I'm Still not still unclear as to whether the Turkish officials have gone into the consulate but there are there's also word\nThat there were people cleaning up I'm prior to that and\nIt's been two weeks Cleveland but I also love and you are unable\nNow it's possible uh one theory holds that they may have been to kidnap him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia then why you would think that the Saudis have done in a previously well obviously I your your uh it's hard for me to say for sure\nBut this is something that's sort of thing that the Saudis have done previously with some people and that the the I guess the term is rendition in that particular case however\nThat did seems as though that the Saudis are going to have to admit that something went wrong somewhere along the way a because cash Cokie um was uh was in there went in there\nAnd there's video of him going in but nothing of him coming out no proof did he ever really left that old\nDo you believe something went wrong or do you believe that they were their intentions were all Fifteen and where to go and do this job I mean this was the job at hand and\nAnd they got it done and uh you know furthermore we'd had a reporter on earlier today and she said you know I've been critical and I have people that have friends that have been critical of writing and I said yeah but you guys weren't part of the inner ... circle this guy up much beyond a journalist while he was a journalist but he also was part of men at one point\nA which is you know make to me it's like Omarosa does that compare that I'm a rose Assad the insides and then she turned a what better person to listen to you than somebody who was on the inside and saw the workings and the dealings and that threat and that's a threat\n[noise] well yes he his history was that he was a bit of the royal family scene or maybe that's the best way to put it up but eventually turned disadvantaged especially turned\nAgainst the crown prince Mohammed and to that uh you know while while to her that turned him into someone who was white opinion pieces regarding Saudi Arabia for the Washington Post\nHe fled to Saudi Arabia a little more than a year ago and came to northern Virginia from what we understand a fearing for his safety\nAnd that was one of the reasons why he was willing at least to go to the consulate in Turkey and assemble ... perhaps with the belief that he might be safe there but even so\nUm he ... it seems to the indications are they turned on its apple watch or some sort of wait for his phone maybe to record\nWhat happened to him but the the uh you know this was it was his intention to get married and he needed documentation of his citizenship\nRight right it's at a red satellite I simply shaman willing to go back to Saudi Arabia well so this was the Saudi Arabian consulate do write in Turkey\nAnd stumble yes\nOkay so they can basically call the shots it's still the Saudi Arabian grind that it's not it's not it's in Turkey turkey doesn't have a they don't they're not abiding by Turkish law it's like the Saudi it's part of ... county Arabia just happens to be in Turkey correct so\nWell that's the way that's the way diplomatic facilities and work of course\nRight so I was saying you know it's a shame that this guy wanted to get married so badly in the sense that you know I I said earlier to one of our reporters eventually if he didn't marry her let's say lived with her out here\nWhen they eventually found him on American soil and killed him like in other words was this inevitable and they said not necessarily they don't think that Saudi would've killed on American soil so if he hadn't gone back a safe to say probably still be alive right\n[noise] well um died I Would think so yes so unlike a dissident so for Russia who do turn up dead and other countries ... uh it is uh from what I understand it's unusual and I'm like I Can't say I know everything about the Saudi Arabia but it is on it would be unusual\nFor the Saudis to go after someone in another country\nWhat a thing of it how what is what's at issue in politics and that part of the world is some of these countries don't have good guys and bad guys they just have varying degrees of bad guy when we were going after the Russians back in the eighties we got in bed with people like Osama bin Laden\nBecause at that moment we happen to be fighting on the same side in Saudi Arabia the royal family has all kinds of problems I think that's obvious at this point\nBut their political opposition domestically if the Muslim Brotherhood it's people are yeah it's it's it's people who are are sympathetic to the Iranian regime it's people who are religious fundamentalists this guy have any ties to those people now that he had a falling out with the royal family\nI'm not that we know of the show he was just someone who had turned against\nUm the of the royal family the way they were planning on running\nUm Saudi Arabia or not to or not at least to the increasing some personal freedoms a a enough for him that it certainly seemed that way he had hopes from what we understand for crown prince Mohammed uh but uh in in the end\nHe felt that the the crown prince who was starting to who's been running the government in a sense of the day to day basis of was not going to change the government so repressive regime\nAre there with the autocratic kind of control in Saudi Arabia so he turned against them\nAnd um and and he knew he understood that he was persona non grata going back to Saudi Arabia a buddy I'm I guess at some point he felt that he could at least to go to the turkey Turkish consulates\nAnd get some information get the information he needed now look to the Turks and the Saudis ... pretty rough terms at this particular time as well and this also plays into the presidents\nOf President Trump's efforts to have that preacher released a turkey looking to get on the good side of the United states it seems a relief to Andrew Brunson over the weekend\nWhen in hopes that the it would put put the United states in a more favorable feeling toward murky\nAs we've had the issues with them as well or I'm the president you know as we know is not interested in at this point in ... the arms sales to the Saudis that he's promised them\nA all along for the past couple of years as\nBob Constantine e K ABC News thanks so much for the report we

into this conversation and Dr Kelly before we get the flu shots I Want to pick your brain on this because you are someone who studies these things and have for a long time\nThe Saudi Arabian government has now changed their statement on just exactly what happened to that missing Washington Post columnist now there are confirming that he is in fact dead but they're saying it was as a result of a botched interrogation how do you think they killed him\n... well it got God only knows a botched interrogation is his his murder or when the person ends up dead at the end right\nLike wrongful death when they use like James guilty of wrongful death as a as if there's a rightful death but anyway yeah right so\nI think that if you're interrogating the person and it was quote botched and the person ends up dead um that sounds like a lot of a ... you know\nFancy explanations for murder whether or not he was waterboarded or or uh suffocated or electrocuted or you know there were some room or at least that he had been dismembered hum and taken\nOut of the um out of the conflict so I I don't know at what point in the interrogation us dismembered\nUh but that certainly could contributed to it being botched\nWell our boss and I tend to agree with him not just because he's our boss and pays our checks but he thinks that he was wiped out right away there is no way they went there for information about him a generic right so yeah\nI suspect you're right I suspect it sounded from and again I don't have any great until on this other than what I'm hearing in the regular mainstream news but uh it sounded as if they were there was a group of people there waiting for\nHim with the little bright intercepting him I note that\nTheir intention was to interrogate him and then let them go given back his cell phone and let him go um I don't think that's how it was meant to work I think they clearly intended to assassinate him\nA ... or or exterminate down the eye and whether it happened before or after some interrogation doesn't really matter that's right I mean it doesn't really matter they killed him and I and ... now it's just of who pays the price\nWas waterboarding yeah I'm On my math guy too messy is it easy to accidentally kill him because he based on what ... okay go ahead\nOn Wednesday\nI we will be on the yes we'll be out the yes on prop six gas tax repeal rush hour about my God that's when I pull a mouthful liberation it in Pasadena on Wednesday from three to six were going to be again at a\nRobin's would fire barbeque that's a ... throws me three nine five north roast meat in Pasadena\nCome see us and grab a yes on six loans [laughter]\nOr spinal tap and then we got a puppet show we're going to be on now I don't I don't know anything about the sex what do you know about it if repealing the gas tax oh for okay they increase the guy from the territories I Know nothing about it I I I'm from the world of football and morning shows and celebrities I Know nothing about gas tax I can say I don't really care [laughter]\nLet me tell me why should care about this and what I mean obviously we're going but we are what is this what do I know it's like loaning yes what if I Want to vote no well it's one of the main where you could vote however you want to vote yeah oh I think vote yes\nWe do that I was a rally is ... ...\nOkay so what tell me what yes means yes does not mean no right yes I mean\nWell they're trying to convince you will get into the sleep you know earlier it's one of the ones where you vote yes the gas tax gets repealed all day on there if you vote yes that means you're stopping construction on the road\nWhen they do this they always try to I Know okay so this is more important than yes\nAll right let's get back to Dr Kelly victory or you could follow on Twitter at Dr Kelly victory because a new survey shows that there's widespread skepticism of the flu shot a lot of people ... Jones died a lot of all\nI Do believe that the flu shot works Dr Kelly what would you say to those people 'cause you're a do\nIt is so frustrated and you're exactly right this is the problem there's it's not just the crazy conspiracy theory\nYou know prefer that that whole team of people who are always in for the conspiracy not just that group this is a widespread misconception and it's a perennial problem\nThere is and this is a new study that came out of Orlando is a national survey of health care professionals that found that upwards of\nFifty percent of parents for example believe that their child could get the flu from getting the flu shot which is painfully absurd and how these myths get started I cannot tell you I'm for a long time the oil anti vaccine crowd\nHas done a terrible disservice to Americans into public health and general\nBy propagate the concept that vaccines of any sort of whether it's from measles mumps meningitis whatever that they are linked to autism\nNow do you say that at all 'cause I'm\nI don't I never listened to a celebrity you're ... not there's not\nA shred of credible right and somebody any\nMedical literature that vaccines are related to any bad thing\nIncluding forbid autism these people that listen to celebrities are idiots and I would venture to say they shouldn't be parents but they are and that's fine and maybe they're you know get polio but mine's not 'cause mine will be vaccinated so well\nWith the ... and the problem is that this all gets back to this big issue of or immunity we want as many people as possible to get vaccinated for any given a infectious disease and in this case the flu\nBecause there is a small there are certain people who can't get vaccinated either you know children below the age of six months for example people who have um immune deficiency problems people getting chemotherapy people\nWho are allergic to some component of the vaccine itself so we want everybody to be vaccinated so that those people are at risk\nSo the idea that a child can know how this comes from the idea that people will say well I got the vaccine and twenty four forty eight hours later I had a fever I write a and that does that is a real thing you can get what we call sort of a little pros Romer sub clinical um illness that is not the flu\nIt's nothing like the flu like symptoms maybe could you say no to all of this rogue little headache\nExactly might get a little you might run a little fever for a couple of hours which is why I say to people you know what is going to go get the flu vaccine take a couple of a lever a couple of Tylenol when you walk in the door when you walk it because then you won't even notice anything but you certainly aren't getting influenced\nBy Dr Kelly we're gonna have to leave it there but thanks so much for stopping by so much to talk about today\nExactly take care and get your flu shot\nAll right sounds good Kelly by the way it ride aid to scoop ice cream cone if you get your ears right I don't like I did it at target they give you five dollar gift card there\nI don't know I I saw one at Walgreens I I just like to go to my heel or my doctor I don't\nFeel you

over the weekend after a church bus carrying nearly forty passengers crossed a freeway divider and hit a car\nOh dear Eli fire authorities responded to be extremely dangerous wreck around ... pm local time on Sunday yesterday on the south bound for all five freeway and found the front of both the car and the bus severely damaged\nJames Rojas with the k._b._c. news departments here with more details James thanks so much for joining us\nHey John ... this bus ended up yeah crashing through the median a crossing into the south bound lanes where it's struck more cars\nAnd that resulted in this along ... miles long traffic build up and actually prevented first responders from getting there to the scene\nAs quick as they could eventually they didn't make their way through and began helping the dozens of people that got trapped in a and needed assistance but um yeah right now we are in the investigation phase the looking into what caused the driver\nTo lose control I investigators will also be going through when their statements of seeing if there were any\nSkid marks left behind that may show exactly what happened if there were any mechanical issues and they've also been looking at looking at the driver to see if they may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol but as you mentioned before you know this bus a private charter bus\nI was leaving a church advance when when this happened uh fortunately though no one died a there are five people with serious injuries but they are expected to survive\nYou know there was a big bus accident in the Coachella Valley on the ... freeway near them around and go casino and it killed people I think they were going to one of the casinos out there\nAnd I drive back ten freeway going east all the time and I see a bunch of buses a lot of them are going to the outlet malls or the casinos whatever they're going to Arizona Mexico\nAnd a lot of these buses look like they're not the best of shape and we just have this limo accident but we talked about last week in upstate New York where the people who were on the bus or on the limo rather were texting friends and I don't think this is safe\nI Wonder if this bus was in if it cross the media because that's not supposed to happen unless there's something seriously wrong with the with the driver and maybe a heart attack or something like that yeah or something failed mechanically in a real fundamental sort of way\nYeah because if you look at in most accidents involving a bus especially a bus you know when a vehicle uh say like a a sedan or an SUV\nOr they hit that bus often times more often times than not it'll be a side swipe and then both of vehicles are able to pull off to the side of the freeway however yeah and in this case we see that the bus made this drastic ah veer to the left to crash into the median with enough force them to make its way all the way through\n[noise] All right today I mentioned we were talking about having all the money in the world and still ... what does it mean you brought up Steve Jobs perfect example the guy is one of the wealthiest men in the world be like Jeff Bass does God Forbid anything bad happens to him but he's the richest man in the history of the world but if he got sick\nAnd I mean really sick what does it matter you know all the money I guess you can buy comfort and maybe the best doctors you ... you think are maybe research well it's happened to Michael boo play he himself is healthy but he gave birth or his wife gave birth 'em a while back he has what a two year old\nAnd his little boy was diagnosed very soon after birth with them having cancer\nAnd Michael says that he is now leaving show business he's done for good for now he's done right now he said I don't want to even talk about it I'm retiring\nBecause of my sons can't battle with cancer this is my last interview he told the daily mail in a very emotional conversation I'm retiring from the business I've made the perfect record and now I can lead at the top\nHe has a new album is called love his son Noah was diagnosed back in two thousand sixteen he has liver cancer\nI don't even know how I was breathing he said adding that know as time in the hospital changed his mind set and his priorities I didn't question who I was I just questioned everything else\nIs only forty three said I'm trying to make the best of a bad situation he tells his son he's in the ... hotel doesn't tell him that he's in a hospital he said I'm tired of balancing it I'm embarrassed by my ego I'm done\n... yeah why not at your child working no I get that but you just should he doesn't have to decide you didn't have to work he's rich\nI give that to know but it's you need escapism some time when you're dealing with the help stop escapism as being on the road you know gone from your family eight months a year when your kid has cancer\nYou got money to stay home do the right thing be with your child they don't know the prognosis but he's on the road and then his son died you know no no I'm not saying you shouldn't do it right now I'm saying that if the kid gets cured yeah then\nWhy should he be retired why not go back and do what you do a thing it's changed his priorities in life like he's done when he's he's made the perfect album\nAnd he's ready to maybe you know maybe we'll come back and doesn't have to be definitive you just said he's done for now why get that done for now but they are now he just said permanently boy we see\nThis is my last interview I'm retired and words on the phone [laughter] Steve\nYou spoke with Michael ... recently I'm I'm retired from the business I mean the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top of my game so it sounds like he's leaving but you know what let them come back if he wants of a sudden I God Bless him and I hope his son gets better\nAnd he's cured and then he can come back 'cause I Do like Michael who plays music and there I Do I like I Know you don't like Justin Bieber out of Canada but we also give you my ... because I don't have any problem suggested I don't either I think he's really good [laughter]\nI just say that because I assume people do like
