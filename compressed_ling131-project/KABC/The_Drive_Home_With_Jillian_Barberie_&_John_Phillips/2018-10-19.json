[laughter] what do you make of all of this and what do you think is going to happen\nWell um this is a beautiful segue back to my book resistance you tile um ...\nThis is how the Democrats can beat Tom he's not keeping his central campaign\nWrong things actually what I said before you got here in every hour I'll let you finish up because I Want to ask you the fall of\n... but I'm not used to pretend to know about\nThe fly over people and the middle class in the working class had gone some saying they can't do that and said they run off on these crazy conspiracy theories with Russia\nWhich is insane and no one cares about it\nBut you really want to want to go after it's been two years and look okay he's not somebody who thinks deeply about these issues but he's certainly noticed during an Eighteen month campaign to be the one line that became the signature line of his campaign was built the water's\nHashtags that's what they started chanting there was a we we were chanting that because we didn't want to have to keep dealing with the camera and Africa caravan and watch the president going to do and all you need is\nI'm a Democrat and Obama were above ... frankly both political parties to say oh well let them into well oh well\nWe don't want to have to worry about that we want something that a permeable it works in China it works in Israel it's better than nothing and he got mad at can where the pope ... yes yes\nDoes Trump need the wall for his legacy\nWell he does sort of I'm going to write the history books so\nYeah [laughter] it is not\nSo friendly fire is more about his legacy is reelection and he needs it for his reelection\nWith his cabinet thing I don't know if you saw Mitch McConnell and you know I guess it was it was new saying that you know the two things that are going to win them in terms for the Republicans are cabinet and caravan\nUm I think some Republicans ... this is it reminds me [laughter] you know and\nI'm just laugh but I don't think anyone was hurt when the the bomb was smoldering in times square and it was um you know set by an Arab immigrant of course um but that isn't the point it was stopped by an alert T shirt vendor [laughter]\nYeah I'm looking at this thinking so our security defense is four and a T shirt vendor let's just hope they noticed that time is the same thing on the planes the diaper bombing let's hope the passengers noticed\nThat's our big national defense I feel the same way with these ... to get Republicans what's your strategy for getting reelected\nLet's hope there's an episode it's just all of the night and they have\nPlan whatsoever for in the end of Kavanaugh they'd be dead in the water\n[noise] Kevin McCarthy the congressman from Bakersfield just recently authored legislation that would provide funding from the Congress for the border wall why he chose to submit it now you know why are they lash him is beyond me why wasn't this the first piece of legislation that they took up\nNo ... everybody talks tough on the border when they're up for reelection as I pointed out\nIn the audio some Eric I mean this goes back Twenty years when they want to get elected in which proves politicians are lying and they know what the public wants this be asked about the polls Oh yes we love having low wage immigrants take our jobs we the heroin epidemic\nUm they know what the people they just don't care they given to the owners the donors want the cheap labor and screw you voters\nI'm On ... you know that was part of what Trump's appeal was everything that made from not a traditional candidate\nAnd we only have to a few more hours we can't go through everything that made him a nontraditional candidate a selling point because we knew we'd been why do so many times by every other politician oh what the heck maybe this crazy reality TV star on his third marriage with a model living in Trump Tower um\n[laughter] who's grammar [laughter] well let's say leave something to be desired 'em and calls Rosie O'Donnell of fat take maybe this guy he's so different maybe he'll actually do it now I I'm Sorry but so far we've been betrayed by him\nWhy is it that he hasn't done it because he keeps talking about it when he's at these rallies when you hear reports about what's going on at the White House he seems to not have changed his position on it he seems to do what it is it his own people as it his appointees but I think so not doing it\nI think so I mean I think there is at least the of the names we know say they're fifty people\nWhose name we know working in the White House or lots of other people um he he's hired all never Trump ...\nOther than one or one one that we can name other than that they're all never tremors including um his son in law who's had just one blockbuster idea after another um back Luther Strange in the primary\nTotal disaster instead of Mel Brooks we end up with Roy Moore and a total humiliation and embarrassment for the Republican Party great idea Jared um start with tax cuts\nFor me the Democrats will hire Scaramucci I'm now I'm at my new best friend would be the way [laughter] but at what point does Trump realize hey you don't want to listen to my son in law is advice\nTo split this is why you can't hire relatives because you can't fire them after they screw up time and time again\nMy suggestion that Trump appoint among got to be UN ambassador it's like when when when all around number one it's insulting the un replace\nOne another and\nI'm a primary opponent and you need to see her picture to see the I mean she doesn't

up ... you're not mentally equipped to cast a vote and you should be not even bother going out to the whole you know I I'm\nI'm trying to avoid us getting going down the rabbit hole like that but go ahead go finish I'll go ahead ...\nWell I mean and as far as Trump goes I mean he's every bit the corrupt perverted pathological liar that we thought he was and now now I'll purposely on purpose\nDriving up the national debt driving up the deficit which in turn drives up interest rates and rise up inflation and anybody that's okay with that and still wants to cast a vote for Republicans to support that agenda I mean again not mentally equipped to cast a vote\nOr the Republicans always historically have a history of driving up that right in spite of claiming that they're uh they're into austerity\nNow when you're talking about the debt if you'll notice knowing I Am painting right now ... and all that and I'm not an issue\nBut he was actually successful it the way somebody to purposely did that most Republicans Republicans don't do as far as being successful in doing it you've actually done\nI mean you see did you say Kamala Harris is new recommendation today know\nHers was take the same amount of money I don't know if it's the exact if she wants to increase the tax back to work like roll it back but she wants to that and then take the same amount of money and just distributed to needy families like four thousand dollars a year six thousand dollars a year or something like that rather than use market forces are taxes just give them money which\nYeah and so those people put money back into the economy and the economy grows like crazy and portion of that shit all on top of that should be plug into infrastructure maintenance\nI mean I think we all agree on that a chunk of the guy he builds things that's what I Believe right now I Believe women for when the house goes blue ... got to go out with\nIt he built things when you can see the only way he built things is by swindling people in his private life and that's what ... that's the only way he would do it now if there was some some gift you could get from somebody to to do some infrastructure then yeah that's that's all of Trump's game\nBut otherwise it's it's drive up the inflation rate you arrive up interest rate screwed a little guy and make sure that the tax cuts stay in place for the upper one half of one percent an entire country and if there are other people in the Ninety nine point five percent didn't want to vote for Republicans is that a support that you're you're out of your mind\nYou know for wealthy people that tax rate did not go so well right\nIt's going only or California and then when California the\nProperty tax thing just made a real problem ah but it would be that as a ... I I get your point I get your point and and again this is I Wish we talk more about that kind of ideological divide ride like how do we make things better is it you know and how do we figure that out with the best movies\nIs it to market forces or to distribute money or some combination of the two we never really talk about it we just sort of fight about it right though\nTrump was elected over a woman who was sitting on the blueprint for the greatest economy that that the the planet has ever seen the one that was that Bill Clinton put into place back in the Ninety ... because she missed inadvertently\nSent some uh retroactively classified emails she was the worst evil than this pull up a perverted pathological liar that it's somehow got elected\nBut stopped short of cutting into

they felt they had a cozy relationship with the with the White House and Jared but this blowback is just tremendous\nYou know like they used to say and I think they still do people get divided into two categories when it comes to foreign affairs one is either you're an idealist and you believe in certain ideals or Europe pragmatist and it's whatever works you're back to the dictator because it works for your country most people are in the middle\nWhere do you go on this if you're an idealist but can you do John I'm looking at you\nWell I'm not willing to wreck our relationship with Saudi Arabia over this this guy was not an American citizen am I happy about what happened the answer is no but we need Saudi Arabia for any number of things will use their airspace we buy their oil they are in the hospital\n... only major ally in the middle east aside from\nAnd in terms of art or disdain for around the very important\nWell I Want to take a page from Johns a dinner mate last night and I share her opinion hiding Saudi Arabia is irrelevant they used to be a military ally\nWe don't need them like we did twenty five thirty years ago and I don't understand given the Nineteen of them were involved in nine eleven given the fact that somehow they get special privileges somebody needs to tell me the military significance of being allies with the\nThought at first he was a dinner it was\nA toaster right near the five o'clock I Dream with me I don't see the relevance of the ... you say in headed opinions and had a very good very good\nWell you know who else has an opinion Joaquin Castro the congressman from Texas to just see this you know I didn't ... okay so he has this theory\nThat Jared Kushner met with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and gave him a list of people that he wanted whacked and on that list was this journalist and the Saudi Arabian government whack this guy as a favor to Jared Kushner let's go ahead and listen to him\nLet me get to the point that I think is most of the survey right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with to the crown prince to NBS in Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that at one of the people that he took action against\nMr ... soldiers getting ... and we have to find me\nThere for me or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure where you're\nGetting there hadn't been reporting to that effect or not I've seen a cording to that effect sure\nWhere a lot of it is that needs to be investigated this entire the entire time light of what happened of any sharing of American intelligence with the Saudis and how they may have used that intelligence needs to be investigated by the intelligence committee the house and then the second\nYou fail finally can find any comfort in the president last night saying I think that whoever had carry this out consequences happening quote married to their [noise]\nYeah I'm Glad that he spoke it up I'm Glad that he's indicated that there will be consequences I think that we should apply sanctions that we should should use the global Magnitsky Act um\nAnd and that we should take action but once again he's waiting on a Saturday investigation since winter we rely on them murderers have do the investigation the suspects are investigating\nSo this is full blown Alex Jones yeah this guy's that's embarrassing outlining barely Alex Jones from the left ...\nLiberals and have their own Alex Jones [laughter]\nI'm trying to check when he saying reports yeah we're we're about to track down what reports from what sources\nI have not read that in the ... have not read that that is outrageous\nI'm reading he linked media reporting the highlight of the ties between the Trump Administration in Saudi Arabia but that's different than a hit list yeah he did say to be clear I did not intend to accuse Jared Kushner of orchestrating anything he tweeted based on press reporting I'm asking Congress to open investigation\nThat's exactly what he said that's what he implied that is what the whole story is insulting play in the play the first part of that one more time because she's saying that he didn't say the Jared ordered the head or gave the list of names that he wanted Saudi Arabia to whack but let's if that's what I heard\nLet me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with to the crown prince the NBS in Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that and one of the people that he took action against\nMr ... soldiers and\nThat's exactly what he said yeah that is that poppy Arnold yeah vowing good good for\nYou know this is like saying I'm Leo tour out I don't know this for a fact but I heard\nI heard that one does a lot of people All right I Am an are suggesting that he does but I have seen sources and I think you know what there should be an investigation of his swindling\nAlright okay that's out there forever and ever these common now\nKnow I was smart is is is [laughter]\nTarnished how\nNervous did it make you as an anchor when you would have a guest on that would say something like that they would go into full on conspiracy land fly here trying to do the two way I got back otherwise the audience is gonna be interesting\nHow it works because when you're on the air you have a couple of responsibilities one of them is to do a good show right the second one is to have good guess the third is to get it right and the fourth is if they're wrong to say something to indicate that Syria okay\nAh I Love it when somebody says something like that I Wish he were sitting here with me and remember my politics are a pox on everybody's house I started objectively uh I'm rooting for America I don't really have a side because I\nHave lived too long to the old is he a logical about one side or the other but if somebody is on the air with me and saying something like that they don't leave\nUntil I've said everything that we're saying here who are your sources how are you saying is what impression do you want to leave you understand this is like dropping a cherry bomb and running away\nThat can respond to run for the most and afterwards [laughter] but when someone is\nDelivering the details of a conspiracy theory you'll never be able to get the sourcing because they'll say oh I have my sources I've read about it you just haven't seen it yet and then you kind of hit an impasse because they're just coming up with something I had a crush ability to have you\nBecause too if you are pretty wise about these things when it comes to conspiracy theories ... built genetically differently to be accepting open to enjoying liking not being able to accept or to accept\nPeople who believe in conspiracy theories on a semi medium deep level or they tend to be more liberal or conservative\nWell it depends on which one it is I think that George W. Bush took down the towers on nine eleven you're probably not on the left who you are if you think that that Brock Obama was born in Kenya then you're probably on the right it depends on who the subject and then the Sandy Hook story where\nThey you know that this was kids were murdered by this one's shooter who the Alex Jones theory about Sammy up so it depends on the subject matter\nAnd that was the first time we were the first crisis actors wasn't it and yeah\nI I don't think you just believe in one conspiracy theory too I think you're all in ... you think that nine eleven was an inside job to also think the land and land on the moon you also think that LBJ killed Kennedy and you can just go down to less than\n... interestingly you need to think for some reason there's something was in you that needs to hear that I think part of it is we we live in a world where the oftentimes are no solid answers\nAnd that's very anxiety producing for a lot of people so they want answers and the conspiracy theory answers something for which there's no real answer\nAnd that's primarily and all these situations that government plays an acting a very major role in this in the government controls the evidence and the lack of giving this evidence to the public for public consumption creates all these conspiracy there's a tremendous amount of evidence withheld by the government solely because they don't believe the public can handle it\nAnd we get lied to all the time and the government also just screws things up\nSo if you take just a crime take the the Ronnie chase in murder where I Believe that the story that we were told is not the accurate stories about the publicist here in Colorado Sunset in Whittier right in her car that's right yes and they said it was a homeless guy on a bike the shot or in the middle of the night\nAnd then they go to question him at a hotel a couple of days later and the guy blows his head off and that's the end of that mhm\nAnd if you go back and you look at the policing that went on that day and you talk to any one of the LAPD they'll say oh you had the Beverly Hills Katie screwed that up because they never have any murders in Beverly Hills\nAnd they screwed up the crime scene they screwed up the evidence Dennis design was out when he was a city councilman a former police officer and saying he didn't believe what the Beverly Hills\nThat's in the years that because they screwed up they created a an assailant and they and if you will fill in the gap right and that's the that's the withholding of information or happens or maybe it was sloppy work and and that's still withheld but that they don't want to ... you know how we're when I first bonded [laughter]\nOh boy I bet you know he said it was over the OJ situation yeah have you on that first gets and it was really an argument about which hasn't ended\nHave you seen news live and the local at\nThree thirty I'm Rob ... you've been hearing a John Leo talked about what's been going on with the ... case in Saudi Arabia and in Turkey and CNN reported to the last hour that to show is dead\nAnd his death was an accident that's according to CNN reporting on reporting from Saudi Arabia and the Saudis are government saying that the the death in fact it occurred but it was an accident and there are people being held responsible in detention we'll have more in the story is more information becomes available\nThe two men running for Orange County da ... there are accusing each other of mishandling the high profile case involving a Newport Beach surgeon and his girlfriend\nDistrict attorney Tony ... tells KBC is Doug mcentire that his opponent Orange County supervisor Todd Spencer exposed a personal information of rape victims after releasing a war and that was used to search the Newport couple's home\nVery destructive to the case cows to the victims a minute this is a it was to be honest with it's stunning\nSupervisor Spitzer however says that January warrants had already been released to the public and shows ...

I think the big fish is Trump if if there's nothing that shows any type of collusion with Trump I'm Glad from the standpoint that he was a target multiple to target by Republican administration and if he doesn't come up with something that tells me there was integrity involved no facts\n[noise] it's a sad situation listen this is polarized whatever your team is whatever your tribe is is how you're going to react to whatever Mueller says if you want the president to be strung up and that they don't come to that conclusion you're going to hate is if you love the president you're going to love it you know\nBut there's got to be a third rail where people can appreciate that this guy was not a sellout to either political ...\nHere's what I think it's going to happen what the left is going to go bonkers on him because there's an extra added caviar to all of this according to Politico they say perhaps most unsatisfying Mueller's findings may never see the light of day\nWell that would be again over these conspiracies on every level yeah now remember part of the frustration here is that everybody's talking about the Mueller investigation except Muller right so we've had now how long a year year and a half\nOf all of us about wanting information and inside information probably most of it wrong that's true or maybe this is wrong\nCould be yeah but he is showing results I think we're getting our money's worth we've had indictments we have had a greater focus on Russia involvement and I think it's important for the the American election system to to maintain integrity and not be compromise is when we asked them\nIf Politico is right and nothing comes of this ... you have Manafort in jail on unrelated charges yeah Papadopoulos pleading guilty on unrelated charges you have a whole host of other people who have been brought up on tax fraud and various other sure I'm sure what does Trump say\nGot about ten months ignoring your New Year's resolution to exercise and be more charitable but\nIt's not too late but just sort of walk me my wife any ... and the rest of the k._b._c. at this year's aids walk Los Angeles\nSunday October twenty first in downtown LA Southern California's largest HIV aids fundraising event will once again be hitting the streets to raise funds to benefit eighty LA held and twenty other LA county aids service organization\nSomething good yourself and fathers joined the navy see another one was donate today more information go to Katie dot com CU downtown [noise]\n\nIt's an easy grand in your hand for care day on seven Ninety KABC brings in the bucks listen it's six to nine with Doug ... doctor drew and Lauren and a three with yours truly a jillion\nHere the national key word and texture to nine five eight one night and you can grab one thousand dollars\nIs a ... a day on seven Ninety KABC so simple to play remember do text and drive but listen to wind up for care day on seven Ninety KABC rules in info go to Kate ABC dot com it's shot Billups and leave a trail in for Jillian Steve Edwards joins us in Studio\n...

twenty\nPhilippe Philippe Reines who worked for Hillary Clinton going back to two thousand and two when was your senior advisor at the state department made that argument to political on friday the former Democratic nominee might actually be the party's best hope for defeating Trump on twenty twenty\nHe said that no other Democrat has anywhere near a base of thirty two million people especially not Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren the party he fills should\nShouldn't dismiss her as a failed candidate because she's smarter and tougher than most and she could raise money easier than most\nBut it doesn't sound like this is just wishful thinking on his part he really thinks it could happen saying the chances of Clinton running and twenty twenty or not zero\nDespite her non zero

had its prostitution and liquor licenses stripped\nBecause Dennis was the only name on the paperwork other sources tell TMZ that the sheriff set up the love ranch on Wednesday night and took away the girls permits to legally prostitute themselves\nThe women had been told to hit the road\nThey Brussels future looks bleak the love ranch can't reopen until someone else locked down the licenses\nAnd
