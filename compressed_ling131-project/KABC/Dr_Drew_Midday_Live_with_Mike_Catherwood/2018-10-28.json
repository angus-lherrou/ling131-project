{"content": "That people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill\nThat will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again we'll find with our students Ryan is that are not from a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier\nThe number one mistake than most people make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is being done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the stuff that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these the season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake I use these bum a pair of skis from him rather than the hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about kind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it\nGoes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place but if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to name all of them the first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one\nAs a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's going to work for me am I going to be able to do this that converted when I started to realize that\nThey make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to cross the sea exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that drafter and just a second you can have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show as it doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags low the view of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you will come after the holiday season again we're going to start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now\nAnd simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if you're ... and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you say we do another give away yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here All right right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find a how and how is out at the half day class now just to say you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of

I was immediately\nDrawn in we should start off first off by a I think defining what is the mood Topeka please\nSo for me and my book route Tokyo is learning to be in control of your mood\nSo your mood don't control you\nSo after working with thousands of women over the past twenty six years when we come in and complain about what they're frustrated about what they are sad about what they're gloomy about it's always legitimate and correct everything they're feeling is correct\nBut it's how they were on to these dressers is what I Want when they have more of a handle on because if you're very frustrated at work it doesn't mean that you're going to be able to see what you need to in life\nSo my book talks about getting the skills and the tools to be in control of your mood say it'll become hijacked by these moods or emotions\nYeah I definitely think I mean I Know personally on and I'm proud and happy to share because it's very honest that my moods definitely affected my productivity\nOf my ability to see things clearly or in a positive light that's all emotional I Know but it affects cortisol levels correct\nRight so this is how it is and especially at our modern world where we're so busy with our social media there's so much traffic and we're always rushing so I'm going to make up a number let's say your cortisol levels you're freak out point that point where you\nReally feel that lack of control emotionally is that a three hundred so your goal is to lower those cortisol levels so that you're not\nHovering it she'll fifty 'cause it's so easy to get to that three hundred marks or you just feel overwhelmed emotionally so that means that no one you were at a bad mood not when you're in a frustrated mood when you're in a place it's that time to do\nPreventative medicine hence why alternative and preventive medicine is so popular\nPsychotropic meds are very important and save a lot of people lie yeah but the studies show that it's one out of five people that are on these psychotropic drugs\nAnd they're usually prescribed by your GPS\nGeneral practitioner and what was normal complaints in the past\nAre now being medicated normal complains thing I get frustrated easily I have insomnia I'm feeling gloomy so there are a lot of herbs that have been used for thousands of years to help women and men get through the struggles that they had emotionally for instance an Herb Kohl skullcap\nOne of my favorites it's from the ... family it's generally safe for most of us\nAnd it is an herb that can reduce your cortisol levels and help with that nervous anxiety\nBefore traveling but for public speaking if you have to go to your kids PTA going grocery shopping can be really stressful\nFor a lot of people you can take the herbs skullcap two to three times a day it's not addictive and there are no side effects no withdrawal symptoms when you decide you don't want to take it for a little while that's the earth skullcap in love with it\nOkay does it come in a cap so do you infuse it what is the best way to ingest these herbs\nSo in my experience with my practice I'm a big fan of ... yeah\nThat's when you take the herb and you infuse it in a grain alcohol if you have problems with alcohol you can it can also be ...\nAnd a glycerin right and it's so easy to to travel if you have a little country bottle that a little brown bottles you can buy them online you don't need to make them yourself you can get them in your purse your backpack your brief case it can get one under three ounce that you can bring it on planes with you\nI just don't find that the people I work with that time to make it to put their feet up your clients are on the run so having a ... is the easiest way and it's very effective and efficient\nOkay so that's the ingestion aspect of it but let's see we want to use in it an essential oil there are topical choices right I mean you can put them on your skin you can put them on your pillow what are the best ways\nRight so you know essential oils are very hip and fatty these days and I really love them but I use them in a slightly different way than most\nAroma therapists so let's say you have trouble waking up in the morning you're very exhausted and grumpy in the morning\nSo you can use one of the citrus essential oils like grapefruit one of my favorites or Tangerine or lemon or even line these sense gave your body as death and a little bit of a boost\nSo you could put it on a tissue inhale it in the morning you can keep it right by your alarm clock and take one or two with you could if he was it in your car if you have a long drive in the morning and it really gives you a boost that at the end of the day if you feel\nStressed out but it's hard to fall asleep because your body is all wind up you can take an oil like fandl would you can either by it if he does or as you said before you can put a couple of drops any pillow case\nAnd what happens is your body will start to make an association with the smells in the morning when you smell great for your brain will say oh I got to wake up so essential oils can really make this amazing association and it becomes after a while a subconscious association\nThe book is so well written Sarah ...

produce\n\nMore you got\nWrong one\nThe new ones\nTo engage the names of the loving victims gun down to the Pittsburgh synagogue been released with the city still in shock over the massacre correspondent Jerry ...\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so that's an average now two thousand and eight the essence he went down to fifty seven percent in in Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had\nBut if you had to would you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty or at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or eight Seventy five\nAnd a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... show that is chock full of great in the right and so most shows would just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to\nOf course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's the part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but\nThis week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gifts and\nCollege in most cases is more is is is expensive and you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a a we think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh\nYou know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at uh in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how you know if you put some energy into something good things can happen\nWell let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life\nYou've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it and so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two dozen eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bear markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those where you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out\nAnd uh those turned out to be near misses a they were close to a bear market but they weren't and the market to rebound quickly after that but in in ah in November of two thousand seven\nWhen one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere\nYou know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible and so I was a very feeling now I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we fall or discipline\nOf and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers it looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we're close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course are so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nOr it's right anyway whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired are retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is a market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I'll change my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we could see the market go down at another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here\nAnd are you going to stay in for that you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay I don't want you to get caught in this\nAnd so here's what you do you go to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd click on a lake that says meet with an advisor or

retired or retiring soon I invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so go their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is a segment a show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question or can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait until I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he apply for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if the applies now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months at age eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply it's kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re filed to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed\nYou can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file essay form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they've paid you and then re filed later alright\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nBecause I had this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do

income taxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her ah the IRS once attacked eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we want to [noise] I agree it's a total dumber and you know what we want to show you how to beat that if it\nIs a tall possible we want to talk about diversification or how much risk should you take with your portfolio we have a way of calculating that we call at your herbal rate\nH U R D D L E and so we're going to talk about that at the seminar

are the very same idea that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients and we are affirmed that specializes in retirement planning so we primarily worked with people that are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon\nAnd we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states and we are honored and blessed by that and Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors and this is now for the second time [noise]\n\nAnd uh you know thank you for that a little Tempe there but you know what without ... without our clients we would be no are so clients listening right now and those of you who are not listening we we adore our clients and that we are so grateful and in fact you know I Want to share with you something and and when asked you ladies and gentlemen I'm\nOver ... since October the AIDS\nYou know you may have noticed that uh the market has been very volatile in fact I'm that first week of October the ... the ... the Dow went down Thirteen hundred points that we remember the eight hundred point drop day\nAnd then it followed up with more and more and we it's been down pretty much every week since then and us over the last three weeks the market has gone down quite a bit and my question to you would be\nHow much communication have you gotten from your financial advisor\nOkay because I think when times are rough\nWhen it's getting scary out there I think that's when we are in our keep you know we have two goals for our clients one is for them to have financial peace of mind and peace of mind I Believe comes from communication if you know what's going on and you have confidence in what's going on then you have peace of mind in my opinion and so\nThousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you play it I Know I\n\nWould only say\nMy dog and may be and\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed it take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college\nEducation paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death then it goes to whoever um\nThey wanted attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS has a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax at a happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid\nSo they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realize that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can get to\nAnd as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as you said the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax and by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as the estate tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes\nThink about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money to ostensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat and come mono thank God and he'd come down and that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember the bury the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's\n[laughter] anyway\n[noise] as I mentioned we are a firm that uh we uh we specially we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon\nAnd so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website\nAnd when you're there you have a lot of options one is you can get my market alert email which I send out weekly and uh you can get that so that to you know

there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk\n... market than an abortion market\nBut one of the things that we can do to help people get started Larry's we get a big stack of tickets here for our show today we say we give away some passes to one of these half day classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believed to hit a point in their lives when they realized they deserve more we gotta we gotta help them Ryan absolutely right now we've got to have to a class in your area\nThey have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that income whether the markets are going up down\nOr whether the markets are going sideways and just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half

one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up\nIn colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can score surpasses there but Larry that's one of the things I think people kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in\nA down market with how margin and different things work but at the same time anything that we don't understand we're usually afraid of it isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know and in\nFact I'll share a story I sure what my students Jim the other day\nIt was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people defined it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if you want a frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the frog tries a couple of times to jump\nBut hits the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else you start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great with Jim ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work\nBecause then all of a sudden you're this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that kept that you've been believing your whole life has gone away and that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or a vehicle\nWhen reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets so great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you actually get there where why would you want to do that\nPeople do that everyday Ryan with their trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it it it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with the with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole ...

to the show [noise]\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in humid Larry Jacobs director restructure development happens structure it online trading ketamine shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income\nWhether the market's growing up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets\nBut when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate any give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined and so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crash there's a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a a a not so that they looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because\nWhen they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals do who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of situation our incoming our retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction\nWhere where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nAbout how much opportunity has been lost on these down opportunities how much opportunity was given back into\nThat was neat when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn where we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that instead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money as the market going down we start doubling up on this

listening to power trading radio [noise] welcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and top instructor at ... he's got to be really shed some light on different income streams of side of the market we're\nTalking a little bit about passive income we're talking about active and can we are talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we ... and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there in those multiple streams of income or really would create that financial freedom but everybody's after right not just that one source and that one source of income when you have that sole source that's why job\nStance J. O. B. right stands for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we want to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had up big ups we've had big downs and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes has to be a social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire\nOr just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it so it's kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our\nAudiences the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody is going to protect your capital better than you can right now in the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is this is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits were payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four O. one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told that have been doing this pretty\nPretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I wonder when to listen to this because it's kinda scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at an all time highs\nNot when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nYeah it's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kind of got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible for us to make any money\nOne of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account it's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling now we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want\nTo be invested in rather than be invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that uh when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I Want shared all there but it was just kind of funny you say you can't live or stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and then honestly why would they\nAnd Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and now nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my can except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement and they have this perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person\nSpent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional and the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up uh falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that 'cause we\nThat's an tickets we can give away let's do it right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that the costs of where you see exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause they tend to your twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three eighty nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow now Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little a lot of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capitals so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is restored how what what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or have take classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time well what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this after class but the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about", "show_name": "Dr Drew Midday Live with Mike Catherwood", "station": "KABC", "day": "28", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
