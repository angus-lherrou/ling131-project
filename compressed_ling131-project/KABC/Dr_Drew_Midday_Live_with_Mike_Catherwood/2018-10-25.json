inspection services New York division in a moment we'll hear from mayor de Blasio and you're going to hear from bill and then uh from John Miller\nAnd trial provide you with an update on the suspicious package investigations are conducting here in New York City first and foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals organizations or locations here in New York City New Yorkers are safe\nBut everyone all eight point six million residents in the millions of visitors come here every year she'd always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us anything that might seem strange right a place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable making flag down a cop call nine one one or ... toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd that is for anything new or someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city and want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do and law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision\nThat can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nNew York city's intelligence and counterterrorism counterterrorism capabilities are second it on every day we're not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today to add up an abundance of caution I'll tell you that when we look at the offensive yesterday and today\nI have a mensch pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD do each and every day\nEspecially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today are concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public reserves\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and building partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city will make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor\nThank you very very much commissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect\nThose who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on prominent public figures\nWere going to make sure there's expanded presence as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending people who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process\nIs to show the threats like this not taken lightly so that they expect that presence\nAnd I know that for those who have gone through this uh in the last few days that some presidents that they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that uh everyday New Yorkers have responded to this situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for that makes me very very proud of\nAll eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation a with a real sense of resolve a they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people in this city or are not being thrown off the game or not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now and the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nA clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred in too much division in the air\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here\nFirst of all helping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nI let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nShare it if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone of civility a tone of mutual respect as something we all can create\nAnd that was um increased a to a wider scope today I don't want to go through 'em\nWhat types of people or places uh we've increased too because we don't want to single anybody out of it hasn't received a package divisive to say we're watching where they go and um and we're doing extensive\nOutreach just to add one more thing to that and if you want to go on the YPG website or there'll be a information about how you can identify what might appear to be a suspicious package somebody over here yeah [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSomething\nThat should be taken seriously the NYPD and the FBI we're we're taking this seriously we are treating\nThem as a as as lived devices as you see the way our bomb squad or detectives went into CNN yesterday uh since this has to be taking with the utmost seriousness cells or as far as a hoax device were not treated that way stomach for\n\nWhat you said [noise]\nIt's absolutely terrorism because an effort to use violence or to make a political impact as the definition of terrorism or the people in New York City or are as tough as it gets a this that he's been through a terror attacks before\nOr the people are city understand the the whole game plan of terrorists is to intimidate us a New Yorkers refuse to be intimidated that's what we see time and time again go back to Nineteen Ninety three the first bombing of the world Trade Center and everything that's happened ever since\nUh people in this city are full of resolve and don't let these things ah throw us off our game\nAnd I think that's important to inhibiting a terrorism going forward to consistently show of those who would attack us that their efforts are invading\nA so New Yorkers had been exemplary or they do a heed the warning if you see something say something but I Want to remind people because we see this a lot a people should not hesitate some time someone's you know looking at something there are concerned they think oh maybe I should call maybe I shouldn't\nIf it's on the cusp make the call you think maybe you should call you should definitely call let the experts\nAre resolve something let they've there's anything that's suspicious let law enforcement me the

A. B. C. New York police commissioner James O'Neill said he is competent no one else is in jeopardy after ten crude pipe bombs were sent a prominent Democrat and CNN over the past couple of days first\nYeah say the secret service and the untold history these keep a a pretty standardized in up to date list of anybody who's ever threaten the United states or former president United States or their spouses and so for example if they travel to a to a place they're going to look and see whether any of those known\nA threats are in existence and they're going to account for them before uh uh the protecting\nTo seat on the ground and let me let me let me\nTell you how crazy that stuff gets\n... we target on my covered yesterday we used to sit in your seat he once I had a a form of super Secret Service Asia maybe every ... all the time and he on the radio right oh I Love very beyond our track that he was there and said something inappropriate secrets and Obama was coming in the next week Secret Service showed up and demanded to see her and did a full investigation\nBecause he said something about the secret service\nYup yup so they they look at everything when people are coming around now they recognize subsequently that maybe that might have been overkill in his particular case but they they got a lot of data a lot of people that say almost anything about somebody's important political figures would you agree with that ... Robert\n... that's correct and and and they do assessed as to whether or not their real real actors are very much like\nA on line a child predator as a lot of them just want to engage with a child on line that don't have any desire to have a direct contact with them and then there's a subset that really wants to have a direct contact\nThe secret service has to contend with that as well how many of these actors are just voicing anger or that may be terribly inappropriate but then they have to assess whether or not they represent a real threat\nAnd then when the president moved to a location how many of those real threats might be in the vicinity and then they circulate those pictures they do an update to figure out whether they're in the area things of that nature so they really have to ... what they have in terms of people who've made threats\nRetirement and former she expected with your rubber granted I you differentiate or for us the different legal categories of weapons of mass destruction versus just dropped terrorism but my question is if you put your profile or how it on I I wanted to give some gases out who this person is I'm assuming mail also this guy\nAnd is it a different profile of a guy that would actually I'm a bomb that will detonated versus a bomb it would not detonate\n[noise] as well put my profile ahead on and say the media's rush too fast\nOr into this uh this could be anything from a ... somebody from the far right who was angry at all these people it could be somebody whose last name as I've von ... left the country and has decided to so disruption or right before the election that is why it's\nThat's why all the packages were left with so much material attached they don't care\nWhether they get identified so in the world we're in today I don't think anybody could at this point in time\nNarrowly focus it based on what they think the motive maybe they have to keep a their eyes open to any possible uh motives for this anything from an election disruption discord in the United states to actually somebody wants to do harm to some of these people\nI guess you could include you know Chinese operatives and things to for frustrated with the air force\n[noise] well the the Chinese you so far I haven't been ... as direct as the Russians the Russians you know or have killed quite a few people in in in England and one has to ask the question are they doing that are so blatantly because they don't really care about the retribution that may be a country like Great Britain might might might\nUh exact on them uh it's sort of an in your face type of of murder we don't really care whether you're a you don't like it we're going to kill people in your country that we don't like people that we think this uh uh did harm to our country crazy so\nUh so it's it's a crazy world and you don't really see that right now from the Chinese you see that definitely from the Russians\nUm but we're in a different world uh you know there's many countries that want to disrupt our elections and it's not just the Russians is gonna be the Chinese have always been out there attempted influence our elections the Iranians obviously you have any interest in disrupting our elections and doing harm to this particular president uh and they have the means and the wherewithal to do it\nI'm just like the Russians and the Chinese do so I I wouldn't discount\nI wouldn't narrowly focused and motivation on this being some nut job on the far right you know that's just that's just too early in the game at this point it could be any number of actors in this we may find another job on the far right and they find out what that job on the far left trying to get sympathy we may find that to Russia and it can be the Iranians\nThey have a presence in the United states that's a covert as do the Chinese as do the the Russians but violence tends to play more in the hands of the Iranians more in the hands of the Russian that does the Chinese I\nI find it interesting that you mentioned the Russians sort of up front and center but you mentioned the Iranians nearly as many times I feel like that's on your mind a bit\nWell I Am because uh we we ... this president has certainly made a case for not\nTrying to have an uncle relations with that particular regime in power right now and in the intelligence community they would tell you for the past Fifteen Years has been a lot of discussion of how best to a maneuver the Iranians into a more\nA better ... nation state a a more peaceful nation state and there are there are a advocates on both sides of this issue a there are some that would say you know the vast majority of people in Iran do not like the regime and they're just waiting for the opportunity to topple it\nThere are others say the regime has such a stranglehold on the people that nobody would dare revolt now there are people that say direct action against the Iranians would would would prompt there's others that let's say the\nThe the Iranians are Persians first or and or Muslim second so any attack on them directly would be considered attack against a two state with a lot of pride and a lot of history so I wouldn't discount any of these actors as being somehow having fingerprints\nAttached to this one this one is so blatant is right before the election it could be any number of actors they could be somebody sitting in the back\nRoom thinking I've got nothing better to do with my life and then totally throw chaos into the election process\nIf you take a look at the photos of the bond they look relatively small I mean they had to be small enough to be\nDropped into a post office box but I'm a bomb that's only six inches long and maybe an inch wide how much material could that possibly hold that our my guess what I'm really acting in an age when it deal um if they did detonate you the kinds of inside\n[noise] um I I Would be the first to tell you I'm not an explosive expert but I Would say it would depend on on the power of of the ignition capability in there and they material attached to it so if\nWe don't know you know we've been making right now we've heard we've heard reports that there's glass yeah\nWe don't know what kind of what kind of shrapnel Mindy and there is a just a container or is it meant to be an anti personnel weapon designed to hurt anybody that opens the package um and of course somebody who's\nWho knows anything about American politics knows that if you send it to a president or former president you're going to you're going to have the highest level of screening possible the the the odd ones are they the Robert Deniro Z the John Brennan who don't have that kind of screening capability the news media doesn't have that kind of [noise] they might have some screening capability paying nine eleven\nBut you you you the highest order of protection is going to be on the president's who end up protecting the secret service story likely you're gonna get anything through to them the Robert De Niro so it'd be different or the George Soros is would be different or maybe CNN would be a little bit higher than those two but probably less than the president\nWas all very interesting I mean you you I'm I'm so glad we're talking to you because you've really opened the door to the possibility of it being an international operator that there might have done this and I are my brain doesn't work like that report speaking do Robert Grant former chief inspector for the FBI orange ...\nNo I mean I'm just wondering now that

want an adversary who still may be active to know what you know things that are gathered initially thought thing but there are certain things are going to hold back particularly if you'd get copycats particularly if you get people who write\nA responsibility the way you interrogate them the way you interview them as with information that isn't publicly known to see if they know that level of

I I didn't buy the Cuomo fang and I'm like oh he not big enough\nFor it will but I think the what seems to be the common thread amongst all of the of victims let's call them that is they are people who have in the media advocated for physical harm of prison wages on average supporters what's come over there and the group too\nWell and that's the example I think in yesterday he thought that he had one came in and out not to the area and\nSo that's the point is that he the only people who have publicly said Trump or\nOne of his supporters should be physically ... that's the only threat I can find a you know because particularly if you're gonna leave out Schumer below sea and you know the the ...\nThe writer Maxine Waters and you have any but said\nKick them when they're down to confront them in public it's go ahead and got this assignment anyone's gonna record with that kind of thing he he had the bomb it that\nUh it's you're I think that's a fair criticism he's the only one that I don't think has said anything like that but I ...

K. would have said that the crisis it's already in the ... you know people to communicate is like a good thing\nIn this state asking somebody to learn English as a hate crime you see so you have to you just need ... we have to create a combination saw the languages because anything else is a cultural events right right right and we ... if you remember what what was that proposition we finally pass where they said that we needed to\nTo educate all children of English or there was just like this oh my God it's like you're trying to\nMurder hair yeah right I Want to hand down their culture how could you were trying to educate them what a better way hey yeah I might add\nDown and keep them back by not the right language of a culture in which they're trying to know because of the activists want they want them ... held that held back\nSo that they have this this this mob that will vote for them that will you know come out to the barricades that will protests anything they want they can they can lead them around by the knows it's good for the or the active\nI Want to know what model they're working off of I Want to know like in the grand scheme of things they want no ... no borders we let everybody and they're all allowed to keep to their own countries no one has to assimilate to everything in what\n... or ... I was one country operates\nLike that where it came to a wonderful example of what my question\nWould be who does air traffic control [laughter] nobody's going to try to get it was just sort of off the ground [laughter] well\nI think you want some portion of the left that is always\nJust really hated America they were anarchists communist they just hate America that isn't your average or it certainly doesn't seem to be the average elected Democrat and then the average elected Democrat just sees a\nLot of views the the third world pouring in more votes for us um and then I I think there's an extra element now since Trump has been elected\nWhere it's just whatever Trump is for they are against what is it wasn't that long ago that Dianne Feinstein Harry Reid well Obama himself were criticizing um anger babies illegal immigration and so on and so forth I at this point the resistance has gone so mad I think I think we can get them to come out for pet harassed the if we\nTold them from does against this [laughter] what do you think [laughter] are there are there democratic leaders did you have respect for\nI always loved die she was my favorite either Republicans or Democrats I mean for one thing it's very impressive that she was\nMayor 'em and here's a little I'm I'm tip for people who are not I\nDon't know much about the Senate it's like the easiest job in the world you do nothing you're held accountable for nothing you get to go out in Washington and have people call you Mr Saturday it would be a great job if you have no intention of accomplishing anything your smarts themselves\nYeah and you have all of these people were doing all the veil reading all the bills and you're just giving speeches was perfect for John Kerry but being on a mayor that's being executive you really have to so that was part of the reason I admired Dianne Feinstein when I worked for the Senate Judiciary committee\nI was working for an open borders ... none of us knew that um sender Abraham from from Michigan one term as always happens when they're open borders ... so when the immigration bill came through I couldn't really help them with the ... fling open the borders part of [laughter]\nParts and they were pushing so I did all criminal criminal alien provisions and really tightened up the aggravated felon section and know have these cars that sort of thing and of my senator really had no interest in what I was doing but after the committee's markup who came up to specifically thank me Dianne Feinstein\nAnd she was all over and she knew exactly what I I was doing my really kind of ignore and she was always a pragmatist\nWhich is a very pro border and her career and I'm very well\nAnd now look who she is being uprooted by Kevin ... red wants\nRight and you're going to or she she was very concerned about how much what it was ... yeah legal immigration here in this country and the ... or what I was back working with the illegal immigrants with the county hospitals here she was like we got to do something about that because we just can't go on with this rivers ridiculous so she was a very big proponent I don't know where things turned if\nThey'd be items you Liam strength and maybe it's true that the state has turned an for political reasons she has to take a different position now but it was rough on them to you probably don't remember this was a minor story it was one I was working with the Senate Judiciary committee on on the immigration stuff so I noticed that\nBut it was after the Rodney King beating and they were trying to turn like two years later they were trying to turn in some border patrol lacking some illegals down at the border into the next Rodney King so that somebody got it on video\nAnd who goes to the Senate floor to defend the border patrol Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein interesting\nWhat what do you think of church rumor these days\nI'm about the same as I always\nI just I just think he comes off looking they spend money these days because he's so that's very funny because I feel like he's in there trying to trying to navigate negotiate his rhetoric has always sort of\nWhat I Would expect to a parliamentary you know what I mean just somebody who writes arguing his court case but not the crazy rhetoric that that is so\nWell either he's sneaky um crafty and I think he knows the craziness isn't gonna work I mean they're trying to tamp down all these\nDemocrats as [laughter] I mean my own party Republican Party um every time there's an election coming Lou they get tough on immigration suddenly there Kevin McCarthy is introducing about\nAnd and the Democrats at least now say nothing about immigration so my party's ... everybody moves to the right on immigration before ... ... in an election year if only they follow through I mean they know it proves that the politicians sorry this is kind of an obvious point\nAre lying on because if they know what the public wants otherwise they wouldn't lie to us when an election coming where do you think of the bombs and going on\nUm I think there is a miniscule chance that it it has a right wing or um I\nIt certainly it would be a historically anomalous that's really all I can say we don't know who's done this but in general the bombs\nThroughout history have been have been left wing affairs my side does not get particularly violent very mayor than a left wing or wasn't a right winger either ... um\nAnd that was just thinking he was he was thrown out of the Michigan Militia and that's about as right wing as as you get I he was nuts he was and um and I wish we knew more about Timothy McVeigh they executed him in record time I don't think they wanted us to know more about him\nBut he had you know hooked up with with Arabs during Desert Storm\nUm I I think that goes a little bit in the um we don't really\nKnow what like you know if they won't tell well we are no ... you don't know do a better with money to maybe we should take some of that money to live on ...\nAlso I think it's suspicious that they didn't not suspicious but also not right wing that they didn't go off\nWe talked we spoke to an FBI or all those who are saying that it could be an Iranian operative could be Chinese operative could be used to the Russians do\nSo I've lived here for anyone I Do think the one thing I feel fairly confident\nOf that this is something that the FBI is going to solve pretty quickly seems like it yeah yeah\nWell there's plenty of material yeah right\nWell he said one of those things could be somebody name you know of of outage who just took off afterwards left last material I didn't care 'cause he's fading out into the into the into Russia\nThough it looks like the fact that none of them had material that would have blown up\nBehind you don't know so far yeah oh yeah they're not being able to quiet about that okay and none of them didn't blow to blow up\nIt looks like it's your ... ... ...\nIt looks to me like false flag trying to distract from from something that I think actually has since none of the bombs went off I should say if the bomb and gone off any of them it would be totally different matter but right now it's just a scary package that looks like a bomb I think seeing people surrounds\nTed Cruz cursing Nielsen I'm Sarah Song nurse I'm Huckabee\nI think that has more purchase with the average person you can imagine sitting in a restaurant and having\nScreaming lunatic standing right there screaming shame fascist shame that is what we're ... we've been talking
