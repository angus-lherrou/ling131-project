{"content": "That was an extraordinary situation but what happened\nNot necessarily just because of that case but that put in motion stability in the jeep that put it in motion a bunch of other safeguards that these cars won't rule over nearly as quickly as a matter of fact in Casino Royale the latest James Bond movie\nThat an asteroid Martin that they were going to flip\nThey shot it five times why the according to my house because they couldn't get the darn hard to flip over you know according and so they had to build a funny road with a drop off and so forth while people couldn't see so finally they could flip the vehicle and if you look at\nThe roof crash that at one time if a car went over on its side everybody was quadriplegic because the roof would crush him in ... in the Internet just collapse and so now all of a sudden you're in a two foot area instead of a forefront area\nIf you look at the seatbelt protection the three point belt\nVersus the two point belt insisting on belts in every seat we tried to the case against Ford in\nWhich they had three point builds on everybody except the middle seat in the back of the little boy of course becomes a paraplegic because of that\nIt was a product effect case until we found a bunch of films by Ford that they had run tests showing that the little kid in the back would snap his spinal cord if he only had this lot bill and that was ten years earlier\nSo now then what do you have I think you have safe for vehicles\nI think even though we get these foods scares on various things I think manufacturers you be more responsive and concerned about Seminole in their food\nBecause now they know there's a downside to it and the terrible miserable rotten trial lawyers to get some a terrible a feeling among many people in the country are the people that are responsible for all that they've dino\nBut let's talk about how you really feel for just a moment okay there is a very famous printed out and I wish I wish this ad would be printed and updated every year\nThat was put out by the trial Lawyers Association many many years ago showed a car and it had all kinds of little arrows\nGo into various portions of the guard and the it indicated these were the the safety changes that had come about because of the efforts of trial lawyers this was a much safer gone it pointed out all the various areas that we're safer because of your efforts\nThe a article you are the ads you referred to\nThat sounds to me like a a a trial lawyer report or ... or in every year we should be able to put out a trial lawyer report card and say what are we done this year to make place this a better place for you to live\nYou know make the better products safer see that you get your ... your bills and medical bills paid see that you get your insurance benefits why haven't these titans of industry figured out\nThat there is profit and there is money and doing the right thing and that looked at work together as a team now that does sound Bali Amish but the reality is I just can't figure it out because I think on a dollars bottom line basis\nWhat we try to accomplish is to put ourselves out of business make cars safer have people not get injured and the first instance not suffer serious\nDeath and in the process of doing so we get all this incredible resistance it's a it's it's enough to I guess to make you\nPassionate [laughter] you know I'm all these toys the get recalled\nBecause of lead paint in the toys somebody just because the heads pop off and the children suffocate forty five percent of those toys that have been recalled the sheer were manufactured in China\nSo now than and manufacture here ... it was obviously a there are less expensive puts them out into the marketplace subjecting now\nChildren to some very serious risk of harm so the\nThe real a source here of product quality has to be with the person selling the product and unless there's a severe penalty in serving up a bad product I think it's a lot cheaper to sell the one from China when they hit bumps offered the lead results or whatever\nSo\nI think the trial lawyers do pretty good but widely\nThere are budget cases out there that are total baloney the lawyers should never bring that are brought and insurance companies have to defend that case corporations have to defend the case and the cases baloney truth me or not\nI I'm with you on that and I totally agree and we've seen it in our practice a for a long time but the problem is is the number one those are a bills are a few of the case that they're they're very much lower percentage of cases as a whole\nWe are all in perfect human beings and an imperfect world that means that are going to be bad trial lawyers will bring bad cases\nBut you don't fill up the baby with the bath water and the reality is yes there are some abuses and we're alert to that I Know that Amy will be working on that when her leadership with the trial lawyers here to help eliminate those types of cases\nWe've uh I've you know our biggest problem in terms of getting rid of bad cases are it's not us as the bar association or the trial lawyers police in ourselves\nWe do that not as well as maybe we could but we do that\nI've had many conversations with insurance adjuster his insurance claims people the people who headed up the claims environment and I say why do you pay those claims why aren't you engaging in the discovery and the fraud why aren't you say no and not paying these claims\nAnd they said why Ali we figured out it's cheaper to pay 'em than it is to fight them\nSo we just go ahead and pay them I said but by paying them you're you're part of the culture and part of the problem\nAnd they made an economic decision not as to what's right\nJust eliminate some of these bad claims eliminate some of these lawsuits but to allow them to continue because it's in their economic interests to do so\nYeah why they but guess what you can't blame the people who are brought into the case that don't belong in the case you can't blame them for that that's all there is no\nNo I'm not blaming them I'm saying that there are claims that are the person who has the claim brought against them and they carry you know that had decided it's easier to make a payment than it is to force those cases the trial because again it's short term thinking when they stand up to those cases those cases will start to go away\nThe short term solution for them is to make a simple payment and move on yes all yes there are people who get broaden the law suits that don't belong there and they shouldn't be either I mean I Know it's difficult sometimes to say yes that I might have to pay ten thousand dollars\nTo the Vita five thousand dollar claims that I just pay five thousand dollars I've\nSaved myself five thousand dollars but that short term thinking\nAnd they saw him and what are you going to do about it\nWell I think we continue to police are around I think it's a really small a minority and I think it's really easy to say that a lot see it as federalist until it's your own\nUntil it's your own and that is going to bring us to the end of our time

there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say you know you talked a little bit\nAnd that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the markets are going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as\nDifferent directional vehicles go well you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the market\nSo the Martin going somewhere either going to gold if I'm going to bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock chard bond chart gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shorting the market now imagine that we just had a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy right you know what if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagined that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou got to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you can wait till a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ally ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the market to go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life\nWe there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know this the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education where was your stock picking class where was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to\nCheck but\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that that's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nAnd it it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half the class coming up in your area\nThey have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works I understand what the risks are involved with a lot of

instructor development and ... structure it on line three and a heavy really shuts of life on this one was turned to the market is one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money as the markets\nAre going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come I learned a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income such a great\nQuestion ride you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this ...\nStream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money it's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything you even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward and\nAnother student says ...\nAl ... and training that something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for that particular call or start that changed my life\nLearn more visit us on line

element and half instructor it online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of income we talked\nA little bit about passive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but\nBut even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying now\nUnfortunately it ends up being that same ... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money to have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis\nAnd this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just 'cause it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing it bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back overboard or some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people make because they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan\nTo help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is what I got the mortgage I've got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach your students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYou when you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big us in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years and one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a shift\nPercent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you've got about a fifty percent drop Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops in accounting and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value as a fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated\nAnd so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and Albert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\nIt's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now the fluid at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as we get 'em out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the class where you can see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways so you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation\nWill just second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can score surpasses there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets that my dentist offices a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nAnd number two they never do go back to do the education because they've blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego in a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding as whites real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversation these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake I usually just bum a pair of skis for him and rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's a very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly\nAnd it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal that we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's going to work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then it\nThey started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this is we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to a class of ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really

of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're going to start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if your coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came into my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan rightly that raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked June or your training before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great uh after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the ... class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do

I. J. on seven Ninety ABC some\nMoney starts falling for six and nine with Doug ... with doctors drew in Lawrence Yvonne end story with Jillian and\nJohn Los Angeles Orange County cumulus station\nThat's number one we want him to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that uh you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that an philosophically how that would apply to you is that\nAnd you retire we specialized work with people who are retired or retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important\nKeeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially if you just lost your money you're you're you're not financially or have peace of mind\nAnd then secondly that your money last as long as you do to be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that had doors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life okay\nIn our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six of core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talked to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a you know a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because I wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask\nYou already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more ... you know have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that what will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nKnow so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if for example if you lied on your resume to get a job\nAnd you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise]\nNow one of the things that uh I Am not going to apologize for is that we would like to have you if

win a VIP invitation to our Halloween ... Shaw write songs do little drive home of horrors lived for Subaru wives days\nAnd this year is no exception and ah so we currently work with over a thousand families\nSo [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently uh barons named why you're faithful host one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row and uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of the of of business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business\nIs the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life and so I think that this week that this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with a thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of a family of grandparents do you have children grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that I I just didn't grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do\nSo [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we created what we called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now\nAnd if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taken care of and so will there down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values this is the result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think families so to apply this to you personally\nFamilies that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child that cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\nSo what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble if we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in the broader context then how would you would apply to in your life\nYou know uh my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife my wife\nAll over again every time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song that you know I I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes that I'll tell you\nOkay so now you got to keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters\nWe want anybody that comes to ah talk to us it is not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have that person understand that every single time\nDon't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way\nYou take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so you don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe it is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not and what you can do is you can go to our website it as money matters dot net is our website money matters dot net\nAnd do you have three things that you can do there or I Want one is you can get my market alert email and it's free goes out at least weekly\nAnd or you can subscribe to that also you can click on meat with an advisor and you can sit down with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be professional friendly knowledgeable\nAnd they will help you to build your financial plan and I will do all that at no charge or obligation and if it helps you fantastic and if it doesn't you know what that's fine too we will part friends\nAnd then finally you if you don't want to do any of those things that you can also do a third thing which is you can go to one of our seminars\nAnd over the years we've had thousands of people attend our seminars and uh I think they've enjoyed them and you can learn about your retirement planning your a diversification Social Security all those kinds of things\nAnd a ... and ... and lots of

financial peace of mind if you're over fifty\nAnd have more than one hundred thousand dollars and invested all assets attend the next money matters seminar to learn how you can protect your retirement savings pleased with that money matters dot net to register for a seminar or call us at eight hundred nine nine four oh three oh two\nPlays register for an upcoming retirement seminar on Tuesday October twenty third at courtyard married Pasadena old town and on Tuesday October thirtieth at the woodland hills country club by going online money matters dot net\nOh it was a um [noise]\n[noise]\n\nMoney\nAnd we are back this is money matters with Ken rape and of course I Am your host ...\n\nThank you Jack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all of the ideas that we talked about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about what are the love it and most valued clients were not work with over a thousand families in forty three states\nAnd Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nWithout our ... and most of your clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is that\nI Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on families that are you're doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is is something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisor referring die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be a strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are a bad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do therefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them\nSo that is a culture that is the values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or or or or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that endure over time regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that endure over this the course of time\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the feel of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago ... we ... we're not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have an actual security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our from what we called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today [laughter]\n[noise] not only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of a ties in with this segment of the show which is an estate planning and passing on to the next generation and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\n... it's not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that\nIf you're if you're the giver of love then somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will come to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us from as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so estate planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what\nTrust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite accused of trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to them I for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many and but what it does do is it protects them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip and the trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of a Q tip trust\nOkay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you pick something for you to think about so this show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast it and listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but uh I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way you have success you'll find happiness I think they're just core values that apply in all walks of life\n\nWell Dorothy it is do wonderful to be true because I Want to do some business with you right now

didn't deserve some punishment\nBut she certainly didn't deserve the punishment that she was given\nYou know Fifteen Years for conspiracy charges related to her deceased ex boyfriends crimes sounds like a crime itself it it doesn't it doesn't fit in when I watched this and she was completely changed person she was a mother she was a wife\nShe was raising children she was doing what was right and conspiracy charges meaning basically and you can correct me if I'm wrong and she knew what was going on and she didn't say anything\nHe I mean she knew what was going on she was certainly living in the house with him and you know I'm not going to sit here and say my sister was a saint she made poor choices but she certainly wasn't the king pin you know what I mean I certainly wasn't wasn't the drug dealer\nAnd Rudy what was your reaction when she was sentenced because I think there was a lot of shock thinking that it would be such a long says is that is what we're talking about uh the minimum uh bachelor minimal when\nIt's just so out of whack for what we would think the crime was admitting\nOK baby there was a time like your family and you must have just been lord just floored by this law going\nInto this we'd obviously never done anything like this before we'd never been through a case like this before so we're we're heard throughout the process but there was the potential of these mandatory minimums and you know these things and if for some reason I think it was you know\nUs being a bit naive about the process I think we always thought there has to be some other way there has to be some loophole there has to be something to take into account what she's been able to do with their life I'm In the meantime you know and again it was never should be\nLet off scot free ever you know it was never that but it was just we we wanted a punishment that fit\nNot only the crime but but but the person you know in the circumstances but yeah when when she was given the Fifteen Years of ... certainly a shock and it was certainly\nLife altering 'em and you know we we just sort of did the best we could with it\nThere was a scene where your dad was picking up\nAnd this isn't giving anything away the picking up scrap metal and you saw him crying and talking about why he does that\nAnd it was people would leave scrap metal out he would go get it and he felt it was kind of like ... uprising from God or something that he was given that he could go and and make money with so he could sense Cindy every month\nAnd yeah he had a hard time dealing with it was that he was he the one in your family that just couldn't go see her and Clinton and there was just too emotional for him what what was that block there\nYeah I mean he you know he went and click or that metal because\nHe knew the most important thing to Cindy was the connection to her daughters\nAnd her conduit to that especially when she was moved farther away or those phone calls\nAnd you know when you're when you're serving a federal a sentence you're you're given three hundred minutes a month Macs a Fifteen minute increments and I forget the the amount of money per call but it's something ridiculous like\nTwo or three or four dollars a call something like that and you know and that's a lot of money when you know a year from when you come from none so in in you and you don't you don't really\nMake any money she no she was working prisons and you get like twenty eight cents an hour or something crazy like that I'm\nSo his his way of sort of dealing in helping was to collect that metal and then even on the other side of of\nOf potentially going to see her I think he I think he did at times wants to go and see here but he also felt if he had the money to travel he would rather give that money so that the girls could travel to go to Cindy\nI'm then he would say oftentimes you know I just I don't want to see her that way you know he didn't he wanted to remember her\nYou know free not not in this in this environment so it was very difficult for him and you know that was sort of his actionable item that he would do every single day to try and be a part of of helping her maintain that connection to the girls\nThis really affected every single person in your family I'm pretty hard and you see a family that close\nYou know as we were not that close to my family and I don't know Alan if you are but I Know that you're so Allen is extremely close his mom I mean it is it's this incredible bonded and when you see it you know it's there but I my family got closer as we got older um were you always have close 'cause it's it's amazing to watch that\nYeah I mean we've all you know we have our moments of course we're not we're not always\nYou know completely close I think what you're\nWhat you're witnessing in the film I mean we certainly are close family um but we're witnessing in the film was sort of this this rallying around those girls you know I think everyone sort of\nAn atom the most you know Adam was the sort of\nCenter of it all um the girl's father you know everyone realized that there needed to be a connection between Cindy in those girls and and we all sort of try to figure out a way that we could have our own little roles in in doing that um and then what you're seeing is that is the ... of of family members doing the what they could\nTo to try and participate in in that process\nSo you know everyone had hope everyone missed her and everyone you know one of your home but you know I think the core of it all was was were those girls\nWe have to take a quick break and when we come back I have questions about Cindy's has been our ... ex husband and you're listening to let go of his law with Alan Garvey I'm Kerry case and we'll be right

with a lot of the problem\nYeah you know the interesting thing is I wasn't a filmmaker when I started this so I actually became a filmmaker in order to make this film\nUm this film started as me just wanting to capture moments in the girls' lives so that Cindy could one day watch them you know I just wanted her to be you know she was going to have pictures and she was going to have phone calls but I wanted her to be able to watch them run and play and grow and then hopefully see pivotal moment you know I\nUm I happen to be back when time filling with with the girls with autumn going through a
