flock of\nLike both [laughter] different generation [laughter]\nI've even heard of and Lindsay Buckingham\nWe have so much to talk about today um but one story popped out immediately oh and I want to get your take on this because it has to do with the first amendment okay you know I'm a crazy First Amendment rights are\nAnd to be um did you hear about this rise above movement\nThe rise above movement is apparently a hate movement it's comes from Southern California suburbs where white supremacist group get together and espouse anti Semitism they promote clean living whatever that means and meet regularly and public parks to train and physical fitness like boxing and other street fighting technique\nAnd authorities say this rise above movement have had their members and cause problems across California but now they're exporting they are now linked to much more serious in high profile allegations\nIn Charlottesville, Virginia apparently many of these Southern California numbers went down to Charlottesville last year to incite specifically with the intent of inciting violent acts at that rally so the FBI and I'm particularly um\nPolitical official down in Virginia said this is more than a First Amendment right because your coming you were importing people from another state to come down and insight violent acts\nWall insight violent act means by just ... talking yelling and screaming or is it worth the conduct because as a First Amendment proponent\nHate speech is protected speech that's what I I I so far I haven't heard any conduct\nWell on Tuesday federal prosecutors publicly accused four of those right above movements members\nOr associates of travelling to Virginia with the intent to incite riot and commit violence in Charlottesville last year um these four people all hailing from the Southern California area or one from northern California\nEach face up to ten years in prison if convicted of the charges which were unsealed Tuesday and all of them were arrested now because there's so much documentation of this rally there were videos there was photographed they they traced all these people back to California\nUm they saw one of these guys slicing open a woman's face a blade gash on her face he had bought at her another one on grabbed a counter protester by the shoulders and jerk in the way the forehead budding hand\nUm the footage also appears to show one of them a hands taped shoving a black man to the ground and then striking him [noise]\nAnd basically the U.S attorney for the western district of Virginia said that quote they weren't centrally cereal rioters this was not in our view the lawful exercise of First Amendment right these guys came to Charlottesville to commit violent acts\nSo what are you with a lawyer and asking what evidence would they have found that can prove they came there\nTo incite violence rather than just joined around\nLos ... I'm listening to the conduct you described so bad that makes a prima Fisher case where they they match their words would conduct to conduct is not protected now the question here is if I was defending those same individuals\nI've got to find out if they were provoke you've got to self defense argument for using that type of conduct the fighting that the hitting all that but the point here is just traveling from LA to Virginia they have the right of association First Amendment protects you to go there and\nHate speech protected so the actual battle with the ... is there an affirmative defense so you know I I'm leery about that type of a conviction or charge\nThat's interesting All right well add more on that flight hundred to two two K.

millions of cell phones today\nIt was much anticipated then much ado about nothing standard emergency alert tone vibrate written message that said it was a test and they'll actually required\nIssue that he always goes back to actually think the president sees this as an opportunity\nTo young adults and kill president himself loves\nBragging about how he got sixty two percent of the female vote which is not actually truly that fifty every neither white female but he's going to lose that now\nWell he's going to lose that but that's my point right so he's got to make that up somehow and if he can go in and galvanized another five percent of white males because we know that\nOnly voting bloc that stuck with the president and it's the only voting bought by the way that likes what he's doing what Brett Kavanaugh you look at all the cross tabs with the polls look at the latest Quinnipiac poll the only group that that this combination remains a winter with his white males white males in particular but I think presumably you can say that that's on the back\nOf white males women Hispanics\nAfrican Americans okay all by far do not agree with this nomination and do not agree based on what we've heard from Dr forward and Brett Kavanaugh it's white men that have stuck with the president and other stuck with Brett Kavanaugh's so I Do think there's a strategic on a short\nWell Joe when you say teach me and it ... I'm going to play devil's advocate and his resume where white male that means white males agree with the president and there was to pose that I saw on the calving off issue in North Dakota in West Virginia to red state Democrats\nAnd the majority of those individuals one cabinet not Kevin off confirm so there's there's a method to the president's madness because yeah it is working and if it's working that means those who disagree with him there's a group that does agree with him would you agree\nWith that and I I told him that and I think that's my point right and so like just from a purely strategic political perspective I think the president is saying well listen okay\nI've kind of I'm stuck with this um you know with the sandwich with this you know and then there were on radio so I won't say what I Want to say but this crap sandwich okay what about good at what am I going to do with it\nHe's going to turn it on his head and going to try to turn it into I don't know if you call it a positive but actually turn it into a political winner this is a president that knows how to you know make limit not eliminate okay or make lemonade out of\n... of forgetting that mixed up if they have the power and how\nIt's it's our lemonade but again his point here is he's forty days away from an election where he's got to get his vote out he's not\nGoing to get more women out okay if anything if he gets women out there probably coming out the vote against him anyone who supports them and and the idea of a Brett Kavanaugh okay\nSo the only people that are out there that he can get out are white males and so that's that's what I think is going on here don't resident of saying I'm not going to play defense on this I'm going to play off and that's what he does obviously I\nJust want to Boehner white males out to the polls which you claim as a strategy game or does he want his nominee push through because he's just a P O D you know the three senators who he needs to push the nomination through they have all come out and said they were disgusted by that so ... it's it's yeah it's got to pick one of the other here\nIt's twofold also right I mean look we know that rule one in Trump world is never backed down never surrender never blinked okay\nThat's why by the way I think what we saw from Brett Kavanaugh\nLast week was hysterical performance because that was for an audience of one that was for Donald Trump he needed to prove his his bona fides the Donald Trump that he could fight and that he could he could push back and I think that that the president was happy with how he fought I think a lot of people have criticized Brett Kavanaugh right for how he reacted\nNot just in trying to defend his name will do and get exposing himself as a partisan I wrote about it this week a medium he will be the first part is an operative that we elect to the court we've we've always had people were perspective it Leo I'm sure you know this is an attorney we've always had people with perspectives on the court right who come from the left or from the right but to\nActually have a a hack and operative I mean frankly solely on itself on the court this would be completely different than anything\nWe've ever done out of the president obviously wants\nTo go out and ruined his cabinet came across as a part of the Republican Party is in in the\nWild things are not wildly looking for that\nI was very clear that's the one that that was a weakness in is a presentation\nOr we are talking to Joel pain democratic political strategist about the latest in this at Kavanaugh hearing you know a lot of the senators are are concerned about the truth ... I'm an ... testimony and on this shall we pointed out several instances where he just flat out lie I mean they were little things that he lied about but there were so easily provable\nUm and now the New York times is set up a letter that he wrote in Nineteen eighty three I had a beach week where he went renting a condo down Ocean City Maryland for a bunch of his friends said go down and\nI grew up in Ocean City Maryland beach week is Armageddon I mean it's ... it's like current events how open up and life lives and their you know\nAdd a little kid I remember we weren't even allowed to go out of the house during between because we'd step on broken their bottles and I mean if a giant party down Ocean City Maryland\nAnd in this letter um he basically says that you're gonna have to warn the neighbor is that a bunch of a drunken\nI'm Latin and even if you actually um did a great and it would suck because of the money and look at this ... ... yeah yeah [laughter]\nSo he said I Would probably be a good idea on Saturday Eighteenth joined the neighbors that we are a loud obnoxious drunks with ... with prolific ... among us advise them to go about thirty miles\nYeah it's so look Lauren here's my take on this actually and in this might surprise you and support pressure listeners I I'm not interested in re litigating Brett Kavanaugh's you've okay I look I was Twenty one so I was Nineteen want\nHim out of and in terms of being a drinker or at a party or and and and maybe growing a little bit from\nThat but why couldn't the way that we all of us would have been able to relate to\nAbsolutely what concerns me is the first thing you bring up which is about him being honest where there are multiple occasions where now we can see he hasn't exactly been honest which you know there's in Italy or you can help me with the legal theory on this that there's a there's a there's a saying from Latin where if you're if you lie wants okay then that cast\nDoubt on everything you've said we find that he's alive even wants under oath that has to create doubt on everything that judge Kavanaugh said at those confirmation hearings that's one\nAnd I think secondly um and I think again most importantly is whether Brett Kavanaugh has the temperament to be on the court and I think that's\nA big issue again I I I don't I don't want to re litigate because honestly we could go back and point out flaws and what\nEverybody did in their twenties and in their college years et cetera but I think Democrats from from my perspective the most effective way to push back on judge Kavanaugh at this point is to talk about his inconsistencies and to talk about his temperament though that's where that\nThat's one of the most effective pushback is from my perspective\nI Would absolutely agree not to the doctor for its testimony is different very very difficult to corroborate at thirty six years ago and she's not sure about some of the details but what the deal here saying now and I would love to get Leo's take on that as a lawyer and your you'll have a a political strategist if\nWell Dr Ford lie because she said she was afraid of flying and she flew here today it turns out she took an annual trip to Hawaii and flu every single year now I don't recall her saying that under oath that she had a fear of flying is that the same as um perhaps Kavanaugh's truthfulness\nYou know go ahead Joe\nOh well I'll say this proposals for it I don't love flying but I Do it all the time for\nI don't I don't know if there's consistency there but look if the if the Republicans want to go and they want to have a credibility battle between Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh I I think that's a loser for them I think that's a mistake I think questioning a very credible\nWitness okay on her account that regardless of what they say has been cooperate about others I\nI think that's a loser I think there'll be a mistake for them\nNow I was encouraged you know what is a material misrepresentation a non material misrepresentation I don't see the flag I don't see flying is an issue as relevant to whether or not her statement regarding Kavanaugh's conduct I don't see the relationship between the two\nI think the question here is whether or not ... testimony regarding the center of of of events which she consistent with our recollection or inability to recall\nAnd I think Joel's absolutely correct\nA Kevin out temperament and whether or not he lied on something that was material and whether or not the Senate will disbelieve everything else because of that material misrepresentation\nInteresting I mean we we should remember that there's not a court of law ... job driving a job interview as we've been reminded many times but I'm keeping that in

because we want to talk about net neutrality something that really can sounds me but others are are full aware\nOf of how it works and thank God for it basically a California Democratic governor Jerry Brown signed a net neutrality law\nThat would go against the Trump administration's decision to repeal net neutrality that was decided back in twenty Seventeen\nOr the governor's actions were immediately met with a lawsuit from the department of justice\nAnd Federal Communications commission chairman a jeep pie he says California's law is quote illegal and hurts customers I wasn't even questioned the legality of the law I just didn't understand how it would how it would be\nPut into practice I mean how would you have a different law for the Internet only in California and not and the rest of the country\nLuckily for me we have an expert on line to discuss it a Michael Doherty is a net neutrality\nAnalyst he's director at the national cybersecurity society and a board member at net shield corporation a Michael thank you for joining us\nSo good to be or how are you\nI'm great um I have to admit I Am quite ignorant on net neutrality situation I mean on how California can kind of create its own law now the Justice Department is suing California for doing cell but are we just wasting money on tax money on lawsuits at this point\nToward the macho issue of you know the content of\nThe law is it really what's at the federal government so upset it's like ... ... number one the Internet is it really under any sort of boundaries I mean it's hard to get countries by Internet\nAccess let alone a stake in the state of California was so much for at sin and reaches everywhere you know\nStopped at the California Nevada line now so you know so\nThat's it and you're right on the money\nWho really the frivolous one here is it just Governor Brown trying to go against Trump's policies or is it the the justice system China you know beat down anything that goes against ... that's federal policy I I\nI Know that at all and I mean I mean I mean California wants to get into the Trump administration's grill and and the and the Justice Department is not the Trump Administration as we probably could figure out what's what's going on in the past year like\nNothing chicks up bureaucrat off more than you stepping on his turf and uh they're stepping on the turf of of the of the federal government you just you know age ... federally mandated thing ... go rogue\nYeah my ... just from my perspective I mean the ... the ... the bill that brown fine violates the ... the ... the federal government has supremacy clause the FCC regulates the communication system the net neutrality allow Internet providers to charge a premium rate for content provider\nAnd I think you're right I think there's a political ain't going to live in California passed this law and just from a legal perspective I think the federal government simply because they have the legal authority to to implement this FCC regulation I think they're going to prevail\nIt'll be it can be a slam dunk and it and then what happens with these political things even the word net neutrality it sounds so nice does that wouldn't want to be neutral problem is regulation ended up itself\nAgain I was ...

you know communication system\nAnd the but the last ... ah you know flooding and guess who pays for those last fairs the taxpayers of California he lost his because our governor and and elected

firefighters in reading and how they're um Internet access was slowed down in the heat his call was dropped so Leo and Lee said didn't know what he was talking about I think he was referring to ring

earning statement by rising to verify that and what would be the pie by ready\nAnd they did but I I'm just trying to clarify what I've been very much but I\nThink so I think they're ... and did\nYou know clarify yes we did and perhaps if there is no net neutrality which I don't really care about but the feds probably could and perhaps ... you could explain or if it's possible that\nIf there is no net neutrality then at least it would be a federal offense for any provider to do that to first responders that would be police fire and also hospital absolutely they get a path yeah they get a

when you have your own emergency I Know you're trying to get through and you can because of arrived decided that it's going to slow down your access I mean she does bring up\nA very good point but I

polygraph\nTalking about a doctor for the ex boyfriend who came out and said yeah she helped them would take a polygraph test um the friend by the way has\nCome forward with a friend who was mentioned in his statement that he handed over to the Senate Republicans in saying that um she has never prepared me are provided any type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam\nI have taken at any time by the way that boyfriend also mentioned that he never knew about any fear of flying and that he had been on a prop plane with her\n[laughter] okay rags to unpack stilted boyfriend might be it very they ... they don't know um we are taking your calls and we want to head out to Reggie Reggie what do you have to say\nYeah a little bit until he actually photographic them we cannot say if he believed what do you think\nThat's an interesting point so you're saying because he has submitted a polygraph exam as part of her um testimony that that he should do the same\nIf the if we want to gauge how truthful either of them are being yeah\nYeah I mean the polygraph exam or if it were to take one and they built with\nA Leah would you open up a good argument I agree I agree with on a hundred percent and it would have to be the exact same question as to that format exact same standards fame conditions yes yes makes regiments a very good point\nThanks Reggie or we're going to head out to Christina Christina\nHi yeah I was gonna say something pretty similar to the last caller which is basically that the fact that whether or not she took it and whether or not she passed it it's the fact\nThat she was willing to I said I think speaks more to her faith in herself and her story and his refusal\nTo do so to me a lack of faith in his own story he just kind of ... just kept saying it's not admissible a court of law or not you like sure I'll take it but just so we are clear like it's not admissible in a court of law\nThat's a really good point Christina and in in my experience or at least as far as I Know and we'll you tell me if I'm wrong or not it's when you're trying to prove you're innocent people dead for a polygraph right\nYeah I mean I think your hundred percent correct I think when when you feel comfortable with your your proof and they say look I'm willing to take a polygraph test because no one will subject themselves to one if they feel their line I mean you're right\nYeah I mean if I was Kavanaugh during that testimony is where exactly where I thought he went wrong I would've bags for a polygraph would beg for an FBI and I would have been for anyone to investigate these claims and instead Christine doesn't have a point he was really quite invasive very ... when it came to those questioning Christina thank you so much for the call\nThey give I let's head out to ... go ahead\nLauren I'm so I just wanted to comment on some of the things you said yesterday in terms of Kavanaugh and whether or not he watched the video or the presentation of stuff to forward and if I understood you correctly said that there was a picture that existed of him watching it\nAnd that it was a group of people that vote that it's either in the pitcher being taken over there and watched him I'm watching her\nI'm Glad you brought that up on that um I definitely misspoke because the picture that I confused for him watching the testimony with actually a a fake a fraud picture it was sent around on the Internet and I should not have spoken and said that there was an actual picture because they didn't have the validity of that picture however\nAnd aid that was with him in the dirt and building said he was watching the testimony on a monitor of Dr for testifying before the Senate Judiciary committee before he came in to testify under oath when he was testifying he told senator a camel Harris that he did not see her testimony\nOkay so so far at least that person's name was and as an testify to that under oath", "show_name": "Dr Drew Midday Live
