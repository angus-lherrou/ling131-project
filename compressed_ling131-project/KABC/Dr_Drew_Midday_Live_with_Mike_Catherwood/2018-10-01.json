L. ... dot com all one word quite a lobster dot com\nBut if you are now as a prank label\nAttorney and I witness to the tragedy in Las Vegas just now one year ago fifty eight deaths are the worst ... worst mass shooting in us history and it feels like those words are\nLike the next one that you know what I mean I feel like oh yeah now this is the worse you know oh no this is the worst shooting it's just uh\nI I really feel like we crossed over into new territory was Sandy Hook that that's where I felt like any like many people thought that would be the end of ... on I don't buy the ending guns I I think the other I think we've crossed into a horrible kind of a territory that we have to contend with I and I don't know if it's just about containing the guns I ... that we are\nSo that we don't have the kind of internal constraints the internal ability to identify people and you know to be able to judge and make judgements about people or I just say that that that's just it's\nAnd our problem with guns of course by here's the deal we are going to talk to a former FBI agent Navy SEAL about the FBI investigation later in the second hour got John ... material candidate\nAnd or we're going to get into an eight hundred to two to five to two to one of your calls on this issue\nI just want to know how the ban but does this how do they handle is big of an investigation and how long will go on that three hundred agents apparently were deployed on this why so many eight hundred to two to five to two of them are Lawrence wanted Dr grew up in the laboratory of seven Ninety KBC will take a little break some news abroad Michael [noise]\nGet your shot if one thousand dollars four times a day for K. I. J. on seven Ninety ABC money's not falling from the sky and I was Doug ... with doctors drew in Lawrence Yvonne and story with Jillian and John\nLos Angeles Orange County you're less station [noise] the b._b._c.\nNews live and the local at one o'clock I'm Rob marine throw the FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is limited and scope in his last just one week correspondent ... says there are calls to know exactly what restrictions have been placed on the investigation\nAnd then there's actual people who've gone to the police report and said this happen to me right so there's a lot of evidence that points to these people there's none of that year and so\nI guess one of the ...\nThe God this is not a crime then because this is basically just we're kind of trying to assess his character and whether one party here as lying and then what could they look forward to corroborate either once claimed either an alibi for I'm Brett Kavanaugh on what she's Nineteen\nThat happens I don't know how to do that for trying corroborate that he was in fact that this party with these people or\nOr or my question is also do they started to undermine the credibility of of certain witnesses by digging into their background that that's the part that you could get ugly it seems to me to go ahead right\nWell it's interesting because everything that you all have just said in the reality of what so we have to look at what the scope is investigations being done is it a background investigation if that's the case then we shouldn't be looking at people make complaints and looking at their\nBackgrounds as well so that we can provide the information to our client which is Congress which is the Senate and and and the congressional members but\nWhen we look at the scope of authority for the FBI to investigate um we have to work at the fact that this is being done as though it was in a court a trial\nBut it's not it's a hearing mhm right being tried in the court of public opinion mhm so what you're seeing what you're seeing happen here is the FBI is being used to collect information to pressure a GOP members to vote no\nThat that is the reality of all this happening\nHere and when you when you realize that that is the actual scope of the investigation you you didn't see the danger and all this and in the ... what was being recorded there were on break is that\nNow they're saying that the FBI is giving is being given authority to work into anything that they believe has um anything to do with this and they can follow those leave\nSo I ask you all you know how comfortable what'd you do feel with the federal agency being given carte blanche to look at whatever they want in a case where there is no evidence against you\nBecome a drug dealer and former FBI or in a Navy SEAL and we're talking about\nI don't know no case but it's scary I won't hold on I'm here for\nDr Ford because that now me and now here's my question to drawn is does HIPAA protection protect Dr Ford from them digging into her medical records\n[laughter] [laughter] oh I remember typically say yes but in this case um I don't even know how they're going to get subpoenas for some of this information because again it unless they can show um that there's been a crime there there's really no way to get subpoenas for information\nHere you know you're you're you're laughing because out of frustration right that this is such a this is such a crazy situation for the FBI to be in is is that what the last ...\n... it's not really why when I'm when I'm kind of have this thing in my ... inch frustrations ration yeah the ads that this is ridiculous the whole thing if we go down plus I Know that there's people that are passionate that saying that they believe\nDr Ford I Know that if people are passionate saying that they believe Brett Kavanaugh but the fact is if you're going to do investigation you have to take our motion out of it and you have\nTo look at the facts and what the facts lead you write and in this case there are no facts\nAnd that's why we're asking for an investigation whatever corroborating evidence but I'm Glad I'm not saying\nThis but I was saying there's ... ... ... what do you say that John to people that go well these I Witness accounts for these memories aren't those facts\nYou know they're not those are not sex\nOr last week we don't we do have little bits in ... for example the idea that she saw my guide at certain timeframe after and then he worked at the grocery store I mean we\nCan't be certain things together and especially I think\nThe biggest thing that and many many Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wanted was to talk to this is my guide speaking he seems to be the third person here now it's totally possible that he'll say exactly when he sat in sworn testimony that he submitted which is I Do not remember this at all and I have no memory of ... you know I don't think it took place\nUm but if if he dies or if they can find some more evidence to corroborate her story I how do we know that's what they're doing right now I thought\nWe we know about the same about what is true for what he's saying as we do about which truthful about what she's saying we don't know because there's no way to corroborate anybody's testimony\nThere's there's no evidence we don't even have a full story of where these thing happened the date and time how she got\nHome and you know quite frankly I I Wish the American public which started looking at these things from an investigator stairs so they don't just say I believe or she is credible because you don't know if she's credible you don't know what she's saying is true because there's no facts to back it up\nJohn would take a quick call if you don't mind is from ... go ahead\nSir yeah higher I just want to kind of a check for them I'm a lawyer I represent people like Dr Ford already fats I I'm just tired of hearing this trope it's going around that there are no facts the person's testimony or person statement as a fact and even in the snow\nThat's not true investigate that it it's a fact no it's not evident\nSo Dot Earth starting to attorney I just talked to any time I I just I could return unless your diet the fact is evident it's not the fact that in the Senate committee hearing already there are facts which is the FBI actually had them might be corroboration for\nInstance if this was a an investigation that goes up mob boss that calendar that Mr cabin are brought in\nThat supposedly exonerate himself from being a ... at at any kind of a party with a dark for that what the evidence that help it tore not exculpatory there's plenty of that so this notion that there are none that GOP talking\n... hold on to say they are they hold on hold on hold while there isn't there a difference I'm gonna ask you that I'm an astronaut is there a difference between evidence and facts is that there are those two distinct things facts and evidence\n[noise] RJ or the ...\nThe notion that facts are proven evidence\nIs what he's talking about I'm telling you is if I had this case I Would prevent her statement as evidence those are fat you can prove them if you like or you can try to do it but to say that there are no fat in that case is baloney\nOkay hold on to hold off and on a John where do you say that the question mark facts and evidence vote same\n[noise] uh I Would say where there is evidence that we follow our things that we can verify which is a fact and then the cave\nE.B White house are going to say that again evidence or is things that you follow to try to establish fact\nEvidence or something that when we collect evidence of something so we do an investigation to find evidence once you have evidence you have a fact\nYou have a fact that he's a provable truth this is a piece of evidence now where the evidence proves we have to fall off further or sometimes you'll have evidence that says yes definitely happen\nSo you know what are you a hitter her testimony that evidence\nCook her her tests now her testimony is um is something that's presented to the courts but if it's not verifiable we can't say that it's a stack\nAnd and how do you verify what I'm saying how how do you verify\nYou have to have in the case of let's say Bill Cosby somebody made a police report about another incident\nWithout any police arrived ... verified\nWell there may be schedules and the case of a of Harvey Weinstein where people mad or Bill Cosby were appointments were followed that type of stuff is provable fat and that is evidence that can be used\nBut he said here's the problem first of all we're all in our hosts radio sometimes we have no way to prove who the people that call and whether or not this guy's an attorney or not\nBut I'm going to I I ...

investigation into the cabin on hearing and before the break Lauren you ask John [laughter] well I just did Jim\nHe will say that there is no evidence there's nothing to corroborate her story at the he said she said and the Democrats will say\nWell we want to find her operation for her story and if there's any cooperation and that's why they want this investigation so I'm just wondering from your standpoint as\nAt former FBI um what they're going to look for it are they going to look for evidence that either corroborate or you know disqualified her story or are they going to look for\nUm other witnesses or I just I'm trying to figure out what they're actually going to happen and what are their approach but yeah\nRight so the way you can corroborate some stuff first of all I Will say the conversation we're having earlier about testimony in fact\nWhen testimony is given under oath it it it is at weight because now these people are under penalty of a a project fusion thawing so that that's where you do get the weight of it it doesn't necessarily mean that fact and that's where that that the\nConfusion was comics on but in this case or what they're going to try to do\nIs a follow up on the interviews that have already been done to try to see if people have remembered anything else and then if there are other individuals that will come forward that they are they also have statements that maybe or corroborate things are all sudden or other victims got a pop up and say things like that um\nThat would be an issue but\nUh in in the case of three hundred agents being put out there\nUm the chance of them going back Thirty years in identifying a home or unless somebody comes forward and says yes we had this party in our home at this date and all these kids were there um it's good of and maybe we had a camera in the house or something but in the eighties that wasn't the case that ... ...\nAnd like what if someone turns out my photographs from that day or that night killing other people that she mentioned altogether and swim where\nRight so they would have to verify the ... the ... ah the realism of the if the the photo is real if it was taken back then that one of the biggest anxious and in this day and age people can make photos like that mhm um and so they would they would take that into consideration than they would have to verify that\nPhoto and the last question I have for you or John his again they can get into medical records or they could not\nI don't know I don't know the answer to that because in a court case they could get a subpoena to get into that but we're not in a court case and so I don't know\nAll right John thanks so much really appreciate the participation I Know I Know it's a dicey territory be talking about\nGoing to be a motion on I think as I think people just need to take the emotion out of it and and try to look at this from a investigative factual a state of mind and I think there'll be able to make it through this without getting crazy\nAll right John thank you so much uh Shaun you wanted to make a comment to that effect in fact\nYes got to you know high or low they there are just hold that you mentioned that the\nUh saint Pete or getting the uh reacts emotional reaction knee jerk reaction going on emotion instead of fact was John ... is a true a as a retired policeman I interviewed many many many\nSuspects in the uh couldn't comes and the the ... you got to be made to emotion there is no other way to live and I think uh\nThe FBI or ... or judge Kavanaugh is not going to be the be all ...

I'm posing look you know don't take my word take Fox News's word Chris Wallace mold her\nExtremely credible okay ... ... ... and if you hear the Republican now that said the goalposts have moved it was oh we're going to put up there and you can tell with a hit job right but now it's like well no she's really credible and you know we believe that she was assaulted but it wasn't Brett Kavanaugh that did it\nAnd I say that's the trouble right because it will ever leave her testimony if they believe this happened to her than you would have to vote against judge Kavanaugh because you're ... you have to call one of them\nYou could say you could listen to this you could say we'll never know they're both telling the truth bar\nWith ... the testimony about drinking at about the the yearbook right then you then you go to the\nFloor you go to her testimony versus his writer and you're listening for credibility in both yeah so if you look at her testimony and many of these things that she brings up our corroborated on his own personal calendars and many of the things he said are were alive I mean we're\nRight there so that's that's due to the mix layer down here we can't tell us let's go to the next layer and that's where he has some problems right\nShe has credibility all he had major credibility problems because he didn't just lie about his drinking okay he's lied about a number of things\nIncluding the fact that he was involved in very controversial pick for the past because he has a very long the sordid history as a political tool for the Republicans\nAre they pick Oh absolutely he worked in the White House he was his job was essentially what Don McGahn is dealing with him which is to get these these picks the for a you know judicial nominees to prep them and get them through the confirmation process\nReally argued that no that's the reason they were headed ammonia in our yard\nHe's well he is very bizarre but here's the thing that was stolen information

that had not been released publically and he said did you know that these documents were still is that oh no\nWell he's on an email not only on an email this is Brett Kavanaugh that says that they had a quote quote unquote mole\nOn the Democratic side who is quote unquote spying and he not only got that email reply to that email ... so you know he never did so and the senators the Republican senators advise the White House not to Capitol because there's plenty of right wing ideologues\nThat don't have the better get back we're going to argue are are convinced we're going to get Amy Coney Barrett that's what's gonna happen here I think the Senate will not could well be fine then maybe out we're going to have any of these problems you disagree with me that gruesome\n[noise] but you know Dr I that's by production I mean I think and and frankly that's what the White House should have done in the first place um is\nPick we were hit over and over we were at the beginning we were over ... you know I honestly have to tell you you're going to have a right wing drugs\nWere definitely have a right wing judge that's already decided and that but there were plenty of people on the list just as qualified as him but I didn't really have an opposition to him and told her to death Simone and I'm thinking this guy's coming undone and he's lying all over the place I mean is this among one on the bench I mean that we weren't really\nTurned me off to them and I'm Wondering how many other girls to him it's possible he wasn't ... right now they've stopped possible up out of us\nQuite a doctor

judicial picture some picks even said he had nothing to do it well there's documents that show that he was involved with trucking these judicial except we're very controversial picks\nWorking with I think he's I think you are what we can call it lying around again I'm not advocating on his behalf\nYou live whether you watch the testimony to moaning he's losing his job you lose with no column on life now you got to draw\nThe while you're entitled to but for instance watching the care of and I think maybe maybe he was looking at the TV monitors he walked past when someone's out to pictured there are watching the testimony we don't know\nWe only know because our point is that I saw it in the room with him while he was watching it\nAll right well that are active mental either [laughter] well I don't believe that everybody\nBut do doctors are you you saw that guy he was he claimed this was a political partisan witch hunt after him and just the kind of guy\nThat we want sitting on the Supreme Court again I mean I Know that we're going to get somebody that has right wing ideology faculty issue like this guy again every look at\nEvery major political inflection point over the last Twenty years she was involved with that he was involved with Gore V.

I mean he I think he did I just think he's used to ... and I think is used to he's not used to be on the receiving agree or at the very end use what you saw and frankly I found his behavior in front of the Senate in front of the world extraordinarily troubling\nThat was not somebody that had an even temper you know a very fair minded approach towards the process that was frankly disqualifying just his behave\nOr think about the hardest and chip on during the course of judicial temperament that before yeah but you know you want to judge on a job interview revenue\nHigher that guy to guy wouldn't hire him to you know the officiate a up an argument between my Thirteen year old twin boys I mean no way I mean he was he was disturbing\nSays right there that I'm a local affair for charter city is managing its police force it's right there in the constitution and no state law can supersede the state constitution\nMichael gates was a guest on mcentire in the morning ...
