{"content": "Cross examination in that novel and not real life case that my evidence professor used and it always fascinated me about how they use the ... example to show the point\nThey've you know I mean that's why Amanda McClintock is so good you know just listening to her now her soft way of talking and so forth\nNo one has ever not thought that she's telling it the way it is baby that's all there is to it and so that's another attitude a persuasive miss your own credibility how your thought of as a person how you look like you're telling the truth how your guiding them in the right fashion that's what I see so good okay and\nSo I have a question from you if a movie made about ... who should be the stack [noise]\n[laughter] yeah dumb\nAmanda tell us all about real justice [laughter] well\nI think that you can think about your favorite movies and then you can look at this book and get an idea of just how accurate they are so there's a great deal of substance and is that as well as entertainment value\nThank you Amanda for your kind words or there was an effort to\nUh you know try to ah you know someone who views a movie the kinds of questions that they might have as to how accurate it is\nOn the other hand you know I think we know that a part of what is important about movies is is not necessarily a you know how well they jibe with exactly what the law is but what kind of message\nThey send about lawyers or judges or the legal system you know what is the image that the of viewers are left with and so we try to talk a little bit about that what is this film\nWhat is its message about justice what is its message about how uh lawyers are because I think both of those aspects of film a are important\nFry lawyers do a very important job\nYou know if you are a company and you're putting out a product and you're not\nTesting properly you're not warning properly and so forth\nIs very hard for a good company to compete with you you're cutting these corners\nAnd the only thing that's going to keep the balance is the trial lawyer that says hey listen you put out this drug and caused all these problems of Andy cause heart attack and stroke you knew about it you have a memo that says this will never see the light of day\nAnd unless the trial lawyers bring that to the surface um this other company that's doing the right thing has no ability to compete\nAnd I think that you know the justice system although it you know it has a a few flaws here and there but by and large I think it's a pretty good idea and I think the jury system I think jurors get it right I think jurors understand if a company out there is\nCutting corners and not doing the right thing that they want to make things right so I I have a great respect in regard for how it works\nYou know a few years ago I was doing some law teaching in France at a French a legal University in English luckily\nAnd ah we're actually talking about this said now in in France say the civil country civilized countries generally\nUh the uh portrayal of the lawyer that you were just talking about time someone who's\nA search and social purpose by holding companies and the government accountable uh for a mistakes for not doing things the right way that's not really the role of the lawyer in France or and or in the course of by a teaching their I happen to go to Barcelona\nFor the uh weekend pulled up at a hotel and what's\nGuided at the park around the side of the hotel on that little deserted street even though the front entrance of the history of the hotel was on a busy main road a park there uh and was held up\nBecause of the street people know where uh people are gonna go park on this little quiet street while they go to register that's where they hang out and they hold up the people who stopped there uh well when I came back and resume to teaching in a in front of these French law students\nI said well who might be held accountable for this horrible thing that happened to me\nAnd it took them a long time to for me to\nThe\nThey were aghast really at the notion I think an American lawyer would see the hotel as partly responsible for that because\nThey themselves were guiding people to go around to this quiet street where they provided no security and on the other hand in front of the hotel in this busy road there is a dorm and there's the kind of security you would expect to find\nAnd I think they appreciated the sense of a lawyer as kind of the protector of the little guy or in the American system in a way they never would have appreciated without that story\nYou know what I'm it's a great job being a lawyer that's all there is to it I'm a little surprised that you with this artistic ability with you\nKnow looking at all these films and the effect of the films and how lawyers are portrayed in the law and so forth I don't know why you're not a joining or for him and try these cases I mean\nSome I have a question for you because we've been talking about the movies we been talking about how lawyers are are portrayed in the movies and of course in all almost all legal uh movies we wait for that one big climactic moment\nIn the courtroom what was your most exciting moment in a courtroom\nWell Dave dino the jury is told when you have a verdict was three times in state court and\nWhen that you're standing around maybe for a day or two\nAnd then pretty soon those three buses to take place and they've dino I don't care if the cases over twenty five grand or twenty five billion okay this is exciting stuff and you're about to get your report card baby and incomes that jury\nAnd the judge says that the court attempted may pick up the verdict so every quarter tended knows how to take a quick look at it\nYou may handed to the clerk clerk then looks at it the thing is about three sentences okay enough the cork looks at it like she's reading war and peace and then she hands it to the judge the judge now not knowing he was going to need\nHis glasses finds his glasses you're sitting there deep deep and your heart man I don't care for your heart is is moving finally finds his glasses he looks at it then he hands it to the clerk to you may read the ... [laughter] clerk title of court or call\nAnd Los Angeles superior case number such as we've been there for three weeks we always the case number we do the case there we find in favor of holy Toledo Dave dino while it's very exciting stuff\nWell I Want to end a today because we've talked about lawyers and we talked about them in a lot of different ways\nOne of the talk about what a lawyer is from one more movie and it's a very moving scene from the movie Philadelphia\nBefore we listen to this I Will simply say you've been listening to champions of justice with ... and demanded McClintock\nAnd are very special guest today professor Paul Bergman professor of law at UCLA co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies it's available at Barnes and noble and Amazon and all the normal outlets and it is a great read so I encourage you to pick it up\nThis is how we want to end today are you a good lawyer and an excellent lawyer\nI excel practicing [noise]\nOf what I Love the most about the law [noise]\nThat every now and again not often but occasionally\nYou get can be a part of justice\nReally is\nAnd thank you for joining us today here on champions of justice joined us again next [noise]\n\nThe show furnished by Gerard ...\n\nThere's no way to go out [noise]\nAnd this week's okay a lazy\nAs we were saying five gas revisited some of the great moments great moments in the past quarter you're okay ill so join join Barbary Dorsey Lucy it'd be Steve Edwards is a lot of special guests\nIs our big podcast for free at JBC dot com I Choose an audio boom [noise] you\nTalk\nABC\nOrange County cumulus station [noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting a deadly attack on a synagogue and Pittsburgh is being investigated as a hate crime correspondent neck for lengthy I with the tally from Pittsburgh public safety director\nHe would not confirmed the number of those killed only saying that there were multiple casualties\nIf you don't know exactly what your average rate of return is over the last ten years\nAnd and you haven't fully participated in one of the greatest if not the greatest bull markets in history what are you going to do when things really started to uh get uncertain\nAnd and the markets become more volatile and heaven forbid we started to uh have uncertainty in our in our global political situation I mean do I don't even need to tell anybody what's going on right now\nAll over the world with our current administration he's he's literally turning the world upside down and so if you're not prepared with a strategy if you don't have a teammate\nWho was a fiduciary which we are a collaborative and\nCan you look I there are people listening to the show last week and you talk a little bit about the fact that most financial planners are not produced cherries and so can you give first of all the definition of ... Sherry and then a financial planner because you're both which is extremely rare\nIt's extremely rare the definition of seduce year by the book is a duty or a standard of care for your client that you put their best interests above yours\nAnd that's actually not in the law you can go hang out with the law no no no you can give you all have a financial planner they ... they don't have to make investments in your best interests they actually don't\nWe talked about this before that you can walk into some financial advisors offers some investment\nAdvisers office some banks ... wherever you have a your management a relationship wherever you have your your portfolio right\nNow and you might have a\nConversation with the person on the other side of the desk about what your goals are and what you want to accomplish\nBut at the end of the day they don't have to listen to you\nThey don't have to put your money where you want them to I'll give you a perfect example I had a client come in and show me their portfolio\nAnd he said uh this is a bad is in his fifties he said I owe had a\nThese three or four different phones and they were a domestic us in the five hundred fond of they weren't international large\nCompany fond and they were a bond fund and the the advisor that he went to he said you know what you don't want to have any of those I'm going to put you into these investments and they were literally the exact same investments they were just a different name so that that person could get paid a little more and that's unfortunate in my industry that does that's that's prevalent\nIt's too bad that you know you can be taken advantage of by somebody you trust with your money corrupt\nAnd unfortunately I have more people walking into my office right now as we speak that have been I'm taking advantage of that have lost everything and a collaborative financial ah we don't sell you products\nOf ultimately everything that we do have a strategy that we want to explain to you what the strategy czar we want to explain to you what all of your options are here's option a year's option be years options the here the pros and cons of each option here the dollars and cents here how it's going to impact you if\nThis happens in the world if that happens in the world and\nThe name on the doors collaborative so we're going to be a team\nAnd we're going to figure out the best way to move forward no matter what happens in the world we want to make sure that your of income coming in who want to make sure that your balance we want to make sure that your fish and we want to make sure that you have diversification all over the world and a different types of investments\nSo that no matter what happens to the market you've got money coming in\nAnd so ultimately what you're going to learn to the seminar and I hope that uh we're able to pack the house and and sell out and what a ... data second event um [noise] uh what do we sell out of this and what I Want to explain\nTo every one is think about where you want to be in twenty twenty when\nWe have the next presidential election first of all I encourage everyone to get out and vote now is very important uh it's a very important time in an all of our lives um but\nThink about your children to think about your grandchildren and think about what do you want what type of example do you want to set for them and so I encourage you to come to the seminar\nOr call my office or ... ... email me at a JR collaborative F.

years of dedicating my life to making people money\nAnd being greedy on their behalf\nAnd it is my pleasure my duty and my calling in life to make sure that you\nHave a portfolio full of investments

will tell you were in correction territory and you better make sure that you are greedy and the next twenty four months because if you're not greedy and the next twenty four months when are you going to be greedy when did you going to do\nBecause when the world changes\nAnd the economy changes and people started to lose their jobs people get laid off\nThe housing market cools down in your house

friends and your friends are saying oh alive you know I've gotten three or four or five percent and twenty Nineteen and you say well I've gotten Fifteen twenty percent\nThat is the time when you need to be greedy because twenty twenty\nIt's going to be an uncertain year we don't know who's going to be in a office and so what I Want to do is educate you on the strategies that you can take now to capitalize on no matter what happens in the market over the next two years because you cannot afford I tell you right now\nIf you're part of the Ninety five percent of Americans that will run out of money you're not prepared for twenty Twenty one twenty twenty\nTo uh to be able to recover or if it takes you know three to four or five years you know when the market fell in two thousand seven uh it took seven years to get back to break even and do you have seven years where ultimately you're not earning anything\nAnd that's what we're going to talk about in the seminar I'm going to share my expertise with you to make sure that when you are looking at your portfolio\nAnd you look at a company is like you know apple and Google and Facebook um are you would argue invested in those now do

rules\nMoney and power with your hopes Jason Reynolds I'm Kerry cases you're talking during the break any something very interesting to me just\nThat I was flipping through the radio stations all over the weekend and I heard one of your dad shows I kind of brought me back to when I was a kid you know out in the middle of nowhere growing up in West Virginia where we didn't have\nSeventy two radio stations like you have out here in LA and really you know on some days after church to listen to you know it's kind of where we got our you know our top forty right and\nThen I started thinking about you and I was like you know must be pretty cool that whenever you know you want to hear your dad and got to get you know some memory of him you you have that blessing that you're able to to hear him and he's got a full presents all over you know the Internet\nAnd then I kind of started thinking and doing a little a whole lot inventory\nAnd then I realized you know I don't have a single picture of me and my dad and I can't believe that there is no I asked my mom I said could do that any photos of me and my dad before he passed away\nShe could fall and she looked a ... page looked everywhere page look to a guy I mean the page as you know photos all over but we you know like my family we really didn't take vacations you know my dad just worked that's all we did and that's what it gave me my work I was like you know you expected me to work\nMy brother to work my sister to work you might add two and we didn't we didn't go out you know like if I were you know I played baseball is a good right\nI don't think they ever came to the park with a camera you know it it would never took family photos you know at Christmas when my family wasn't one just got to sit around and you know in ... and take pictures it's just not the kind of not the way my family was you know\nAnd it's the exact opposite the minute I was born I mean there were as many cameras and video and the oldest video camera you can get I was born in Seventy two so you know they weren't the greatest but we have every thing on film it's crazy it's off some of it has sounds on the doesn't but we have everything and I just feel like\nThat must be such a bummer now you have a picture of it out of course there's pictures of it that does not you and him together act that's just corrupt\nAnd made me sad and I was telling you yes I Do have you know I can hear my dad on the radio like for people who is your dad who died Casey case them from American top forty for the young young ones he uh he\nWas Shadi on Scooby Doo so that was my dad so I get to hear him read it three hundred and fifty cartoons I turn on a cartoon a my dad most likely to voice their you know\nSo I can hear and what it does make me sad sometimes when people play I'm On I'm doing an interview like hey we have this and they play an interview they done with my dad or something they think is interesting are funny and it's a ... sometimes I can deal with it and sometimes it just brings shares my eyes absolutely yeah\nA very rarely can I talk about my doubts about ball and my little baby\nYeah they didn't and speaking of your dad and speaking of what you went through when he passed away you take care of their family financial you really\nYou know even before he passed away you know 'cause when she got really sick when I was five and he owned three\nRental properties including now so we lived in yet a business you know when when I was five he was fifty five so he was fifty when I was born I was the last one and\nOver the course of the next ten years when I was five two tunnels Fifteen he ultimately ended up passing when I was Fifteen every year he would spend more and more time in the hospital\nWhen he would come home from the hospital there'll be a lot of work to catch up on on all these rental properties and things like that one time my dad put a rope around my waist and put me up on the roof of a one of our rental properties\nAnd taught I had to tie the rope around the chimney and I was taking a sledgehammer to the gym because he wanted me to take the top off the Jimmy so we could rebuild the Gemini\nBut that was your safety harness\nSafety on kind of going to show your kind of our word you know like I didn't start out as a you know investment advisor even though I was\nBlessed with a numbers I was you know we ... we grew up in coal country so I was you know always working on a property and always working in the in you know ... you know the the acreage that we had\nRaking leaves my dad and one summer just of who just want to keep me all the trouble he had me take a screwdriver and pick the um weeds out of the bricks along the sidewalk and what it was along side will\nPay you know they didn't get like five or ten says\nNo I asked my dad for money all the time and the simple answer was no and so that's when I started ah to go out there and make my own\n[laughter]\nVery interesting jobs I'd have to say and\nA jobs that usually somebody who was in grammar school I guess or younger wouldn't do I mean you really came up with some creative ways to make your money\nYou know I didn't like not having money here you know I mean I like\nYou know having money and not my dad you know when that first of all it was a trickle down effect right my dad wouldn't charge his customers\nSo you want so he wasn't going to give me the money you know and my mom didn't work during that time so there's really no no money to go around and I was the number three like my sister's eight years old and my brother's six years older than me\nSo they had like you know they had things to buy you know to be with their life\nMy brother was a photographer so yeah the cameras the by he only seem to get everything he\nWent yeah let me tell you that when you when you made the money when you were Thirteen and he made the investment in Microsoft\nBut nobody told you to make us investment just for people that that don't know the show are not familiar with money and power with Jason Reynolds you know I you walk in at Thirteen Years old until a broker to put the money down and Microsoft because you know and you've studied the market and the patterns and you know the skinhead\nSo when it does hit and when it's a massive\nFinancial windfall what is your brother and sister and say what were they just in shock oh they just knew that that you know I think\nUh well my mom you know my mom and I were talking the other day and she goes Jason you know whenever you would wake up in the morning you'd come downstairs and you'd grab the newspaper you'd prop your feet up on the table and you read the newspaper\nAnd she was like that drove me nuts [laughter]\nLike she was like you're going to drive you nuts and I go why mom because I really\nLiked so proud of my kid you know\nThe couch his feet up reading the newspaper getting his hands all dirty I'd be so proud and she's like what you're doing my mom's not impressed [laughter] so\nI Know why she's my mom but at the time when I first started making those investments and I went to college I came back home for Thanksgiving after I got my associates degree\nAnd at the time I really didn't even think that I was going to go back to get my bachelor's degree I I thought I'd already accomplished everything I in the world you know we're in Fairmont West Virginia not everybody goes to college you know\nI'm In the first place so when I got my two year degree which I got in Fifteen months by the way\nI graduated at Thanksgiving so I went home for Thanksgiving and after about a couple of days in Fairmont West Virginia I said okay I Need I Need to go back and get a job and um I didn't look for any other job assigned except for being a stockbroker and uh\nOnce I got the taste of being a stockbroker there was nothing in the world that I wanted that was it for you stocks\nAll the time I never wanted to be anything else in in my life I

[noise]\nThis show furnished by collaborative financial\n\nYou could read about those dollars more times\nWhere do I grew up here it's so not\nThere for a day on some of the money starts falling from the sky at six and nine with ... with doctors ruin Lawrence with Jillian and John Kades CBC Los Angeles actually going to ...\nThe FBI is investigating the attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue that left at least ten people dead as a hate\nCrime was a horrific scene worship or shot and killed in cold blood as they prayed on the Jewish Sabbath\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs the loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent and Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to\nBut you don't want to but if you had to would you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nAt age sixty or at age Seventy five which one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five and a if\nYou answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter]\nSo so we'll talk about that now you don't let jak most shows would actually stop there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great info right and so most shows are just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's part of the show we talk about how to pass\nOnto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but\nThis week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're going to talk about paying for college and not having to\nPay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gift and college in most cases is more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a a we think the boys and Girls Club this one is a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at uh in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs [noise]\nAnd uh it is it is [noise]\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life\nYou've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you've got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet\nUh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven and what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens\nIs that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out and are those turned out to be near misses or they were close to bear market but they weren't\nAnd the market to rebound quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there wasn't a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I was very feeling that I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline\nOf and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers it looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course are so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nOr it's right anyway whatever point being\nLadies and gentlemen is that if you are retired are retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is a market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I changed my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we can see the market go down to another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here\nAnd are you going to stay in for that you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay

[noise]\nBecky jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marble is wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same idea that we talk about with our love it and most valued clients\n... do and I you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and uh so we we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's a thing we're proud of but without our clients we'd boards probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go as well kiss for those of you are not clients or\nIf you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon I invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security uh journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy will I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part egg All right so a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and his eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escapes twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply now will his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months at age eighty um with all the delay credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for you okay so ... it's kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to a receipt to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out okay so\nIt's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter] that's good\nSo here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re filed okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss aid form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they've paid you and then re filed later All right\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nHas this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we

to reduce your income taxes during your retirement we're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four O. one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her or the IRS once attacked eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we don't [noise] I agree and you know what we want to show you how to beat that if it is\nA tall possible we want to talk about diversification or how much risk should you take with your portfolio we have a way of calculating that we call it your hurdle rate\nH U R D L E and so we're going to talk about that at the seminar

over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that as you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nAnd a ... a recently named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on them I give it to my clients well this is the part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and uh so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you play it\nI knew I\n\nWould say\nMy dog and may be\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nIs Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon\nYour death and it goes to whoever um and they wanted attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax it happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they died as no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid\nSo they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we are going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realize that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars\nPer person that you can give to and as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as you said the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax and by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student and then have them pay it\nThe institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have to go through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money\nTo ostensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know this this sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like him slept all night he'd wake up and time to watch the gong show remember bury the was that guy named Barry something who did the gong show he would wake up in time to watch the show on television and\nThen you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money so if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are from that uh we uh we ... we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon and so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website\nAnd when you're there you
