or her handlers minds that her husband is the worst blender and she and she is yeah\nI I Would argue the bad and it certainly is if the border and she'd be a border and uh some of the bowling she gets as a direct result result to that I don't see how she could miss but we'll see\nUm she also of course we were talking about how she spoke about the me too movement and she said she stood with women but she wanted to see hard evidence\nYes well that she's there to fight with it ever was later\nMany people have brought up that her a hard evidence would be something like a ... audio recording on a

away that's pretty good right the person that got away was I don't know what he's talking about I have no\nIdea what that means oh but but I but I get was going to political you try to take their some data about your study that showed that people are very upset about the um thought police are still unhappy about hunger language police and stuff so I bet he's going up there but sort of what he tried to rally maybe patterns\nYeah it makes sense\nTo that extent of it 'cause that's what he was saying makes no sense but the motivation makes sense\nYeah this isn't the first time he was mocked the movement he was talking about giving out of his Warren a DNA test me to move and he said well this was um ... back in Montana\nEarlier when he said we'll take that little kid and we have to do it very

get into the weeds on this and we have lots of time to give you guys call give for you to give us a call give us a conversation we're also going to speak with an attorney\nRJ Medway Leon and well Ian regarding the NYPD detective role cited as the da drops part of my teen sexual assault cases and we just get into and that as well\nAs I said quarter before will automatically what a pair of tickets to see slash just dial eight hundred to two to five to to do and you win a pair of those tickets so let's dial back for just one minute here we have a writing um what if money were to say on the most troll the person in the world\nYeah that there'll be accurate yeah that any person in the public I Would have to expect some of that you know\nIt but to be the most trolls in the world you'd have to get a lot of it okay\nHow's that affecting her everyday life besides making her feelings\nAre not familiar that eight hundred to two to five to to do his phone number here as I said we're going to speaking ... will be speaking her friend ... don't forget about the ... cats it's available now drops Monday's KBC dot com and audio boom time take a little break for some news Rob rancor\n\nBoy six nine new injury here the national key word and ... and I'm five eight one\nNight or your shot done thousands of dollars\nWell we're looking but sitting by to Peter\n... ... bc Los Angeles Orange County a little station [noise]\nSay BBC News live and the local level one o'clock on ... hurricane Michael award or sure is a powerful category for hurricane near Mexico beach\nCorresponding Erica Hill has been surveying the damage in nearby Panama City Beach Florida\nNow and so this is not something that wasn't light and that that it was very very well\nWell possible that the Saudi kingdom did actually murder this journalist and that's coming from within the Saudi Saudi Saudi Arabia is um you know national security details\nSo now though because he is presumed to be dead because and the ... the basically Trump is that I I'm not planning to do anything because\nIt's a I'm not planning to give these arms deal to Russia or China\nUm you have this separation it's rants now between the president and Congress you have the Senate for Foreign Relations committee sending this bipartisan letter to the president calling for a full investigation of Saudi Arabian official I mean what's the present going to do with that nothing\n[noise] I you know I don't know Rand Paul was actually rattling about it I'm Senator Rand Paul was in there and saying this is why we shouldn't be giving them this hundred billion dollar plus arms deal leading them to create one of the\nWorst humanitarian crisis in the world which is in Yemen right now like you know thousands upon thousands of people I mean Yemen is a horror show right now we've had a hard in that as well with them didn't we\nYeah we gave them we gave them the arms that's what they're using to kill these or Yemeni the ones who funnel those are those arms to different rebel groups in Yemen it's an absolute horror show right now but once again\nBecause the foreign policy brains with a foreign policy minds in Washington DC consider Iran that great you know a threat to the world um\nAnd Saudi Arabia hates Iran therefore we're allied with Saudi Arabia the one interesting thing will happen is if turkey\nUm steps up to the plate because um turkey as a member of NATO turkey has tremendous influence inside the view and was eve countries I'm going to see a turkey stands up to to Saudi Arabia and so forth and we've seen what the president Oregon um\nHe's actually he first said that was a murder now he's saying it's a missing person I'm so he may be backing down from the initial thing but there's a lot of internal politics extra appalled that are going\nOn and it was the Turkish government that release the video right where we see him locking yeah constantly that we see the black man's pull up and then he never\nMature with Ron your favorite book Donald Trump or explanation of his involvement with this talking to the Saudis [laughter] when\nThey asked the reporter I Am asking me something to the Saudi Government of Pakistan parents who doesn't you know what I'm really not at liberty to say but the answer is yes [laughter]\n\nRecon [laughter]\nBut I mean you're giving up a good point I mean this is not just the Trump being problem this has been decades in the making going back you know three and then changing that when you doesn't feel like the Saudi Arabian government we basically telling them we will look the other way you have a lucrative contract with you oh you know direct\n... in the United states has a money to Saudi ... in their back barring Kushner bomb have done a lot of\nThem but my my point being we didn't make any difference because the president really wanted to make the distinction here that Jim ... is a permanent resident he is not a citizen of the United states if you what would that make a bigger difference would we have to be forced to do so yeah I\nThink so I I Do think so because you know when Trump went to North Korea before you even sit\nFor talk all of our journalists to come home um and he's done he's done things for American citizens in the past and so of other president but I really do think if it was an American citizen there would be um more of an obligation to bring him home\nThe uh you know the problem is I mean really is there's there is the thinking in Washington DC that there are these you know men and women who are\nQuote unquote brilliant they include John Bolton and and people who are on Obama and ambushes and Clinton's and everyone's going back to when\nThe CIA overthrew the shah of Iran and we created this situation Iran now and so now we need to ally with other people to fix the situation Iran that we created um you know these are these are the brain children or running the Washington DC foreign policy and\nUm they are they are allied with\nShip from military but I think your point is well taken though the neo cons exactly but but at this time where they're trying to tighten the screws on Iran ... the last time that this is certainly lots of time to start to undermine their relationship with the Saudis\nRight and also you remember the new prince of Saudi Arabia is considered a reformer will have the right to vote when they have the right to drive on whether that is true\n... camel jockeys he also he also said I don't watch that but he also said\nYeah I don't know how it affects the way he saw the video these child basically slave camel jockeys that were racing and he decided to fill a void in many ways he\nHe also like you know he also said that anyone he uh he also kicked out a bunch of our rest of the bunch of 'em a bunch of Muslim clerics who were who or who are organizing ...\nYeah he has done some things that he that that will consider him a reform is certainly\nMuch of it on his father but at the same time and the reason that Saudi Arabia gets a special privileges because they're an enemy Iran Iran is and then the United states because of the CIA is operations in the seventies and um it's you know a fifty are ongoing cycle and that's why we're assisting now in this horrible situation this humanitarian crisis in Yemen\nUm and not assisting and the good way of singing the bad way um\nBut I mean that's that's who runs Washington DC and every time someone says there and says hey you know I have a question of congressman says I have a question about\nThis the ah you know the middle of the the arms or the or the manufacturers of of of some of the military to people who make 'em who make billions of dollars off of planes and tanks and guns\nThey sit there and they don't into someone's campaign or and so you'll have used it was so there's no there's no easy solution is I don't think you have a couple of brave people in Congress bringing this up\nUm I Do think if it was an American citizen it'd be different 'cause you saw when North Korea something different going on\nUm but I just think with Saudi Arabia it's it's we're in is wearing a hard place and it's a hard place by our own making\nTalking to ride gr dose given washing examiner or what any articles coming up for you and the Washington Examiner\nFired just had a great piece out how there was a fundraiser this is made up boomers do by the way if you're over fifty you have to stop writing off your emotions on social media there was um there was this\nDemocratic fund raiser who is raising tons of money for the Democratic candidates in red states and in red districts and running as moderate and she was writing on Facebook on social media you know as the Bible voters ask white men you racist sex this country and bashed Merrick on social media I went on her Facebook and it was all there and I was like huh\nThat's interesting and it goes on you know months and months and months to purchase trashing the country so it was really good I suppose and I call both congressional candidate to choose raising four in Texas or Kentucky and ask them for a statement is this what you believe 'cause you attended her house\nTo fund raisers for this you know there was no response I'm Still waiting for the call back from a backing you may be waiting for a while I may be waiting\nFor a while also had an article about that and Breitbart a day about the New York times and Sienna college is doing live polling which is so interesting because you see the light updates based upon demographic breakdown it's so interesting that done over the country and a very interesting trend that I've noticed is that millennials from\nWhite working class districts heavily white working class districts are trending Republican and the only thing that I can assume is ... maybe there's a flaw in the polling but at this polling history is correct um is the New York times not a conservative in our website I'm at the polling is correct It's probably because if you're under thirty five you didn't grow up with the\nDemocratic Party that was a party of the of the union worker or if you grew up with a party that's out there and was with a social justice warrior right and so you know you have no loyalty the Democratic party that maybe with your grandfather did was like a hard core you know union man\nSo they're they're ... they're pulling away from it it's interesting I ... yeah yeah and then I started\nCollege New York times in West Virginia third district which is the southern portion of West Virginia the Republican was ahead with Eighteen to twenty nine year olds by sixty points so\nMaybe the polling is all off but that's tremendous in southern Illinois and in ... in central Virginia and all these places that are very you know hard hit by by uh by working class blue collar districts\nA young people were trying to Republican\nWell you know what we're made of reminds me of and I kind of seen this on my own kids a little bit is they're very it's a very persuadable grew so they're very persuaded by what they're hearing when they're in college then they get out in the real world and they're like oh wait a minute and they were persuaded differently\nOr so it's a girl yeah you know it's a group that it's it's not just\nIdeologically in at least on the fringes or maybe in the ...\nYou know the

the White House today and\nWhether some of his rhetoric an attempt to do good is doing more harm than not real go was making a comment before the least he was using his platform\nFor good right isn't that the reasonable summary of what river was saying that he at least in my or the attempt this is shaved disagree shake\nYou guys please do not all are the kind of you to me Kanye West is very far from having any type of what happened to the west of two thousand you have in West who who actually when I ... and blame everybody in that and in that room\nIt was his fault that he that was their fault that he went to they'll get plastic surgery the same thing that his mom died from right\nBut what let's let's do it may take your friends that have to do with him trying to work on prison reform\nOkay what what are they trying to have anything to do with federal me yeah they just\nHad a platform two months three months ago what all the clergyman right from all over the place who are going to work on Christmas for what happened to that why they jumping from them so\nI I think because because that was the question is yeah I think that if what kind of work to do things that sorry go ahead and that\nWas on the Southside of Chicago he doesn't need to go to the White House to try to work for what has he done since before that\nHe doesn't because he's a he's a celebrity has got plenty of money doesn't need to do that's all I'm saying is why are we going to ridicule someone who's just trying to his world better I think that's what he's doing I think he's going there to to hurt anybody\nWas going there\nTo be the bottom line just like his wife when God Bless her soul she went and got the other lady\nBut she did get Alice Johnston out of prison early so can't we say that some good came out of that\nShe didn't really did so then what why wouldn't somebody like going to work on someone who I Believe his name was Julius Jones or something is that an older man on death will they have all this evidence showing twenty something years ago that he absolutely did not\nI Believe that in one of the people that he's going to talk to the outskirts\nWhere he's going to try to do it but what what what's wrong with that the question what's what why are people so upset with him for doing that or if I it seems like his rhetoric upsets people but please tell me\nBecause to me if you're going to do it without trying to be said\nThey'll do their job but without being seen things don't get done unfortunately it is the world we live in I mean if he wasn't Kanye West and he was just a regular active as he wouldn't have had a meeting with the president\nOkay let me tell you something about about about\nKanye West talked about we need more if you will about a few years ago one of her life but what about the things he was saying about those things that he's out out of his mouth about her show any\nType of love or any kind of unity of coming to\nSay I hear what you're saying like can't someone have said awful things in the past but still be trying to do good I mean is it possible to have two things happen at once\nInstead of saying that black people stayed in slavery by themselves how about things about you know what I said some God awful things about my ex ever oh I'm Sorry I never should have said they'll thing let's try to come together in\nA larger maybe ... a former\nCriticize somebody on the one hand and then do it you know on the other has the same thing I like the girls like you know they've been doing that for Obama and you don't trust me\nAll those people and what would be saying there are so get better so get now they're doing it for a trip I Try not to just wonderful came up and\nThey'll get diamonds don't get a different situation I don't know but I ... I understand your point and I I think that's what a lot of people are angry about they say that you know kind of does not represent us\nHere he just like you know what to say whatever whatever it was and he did that tell us what he was the worst person in the world for a\nThey I mean there are plenty of African American people living in this country that support Donald Trump ... but the African American community has really attack him yeah because maybe they drop on how that trade them caught on your yeah\nLet me let me their Bailey as there's incumbent here on the heels of this Bailey go ahead\nThanks ... this is that if the president listen here on was the lead\nAnd then the key to a single\nExploding except for the world about something that he can articulate\nBut here's the thing mainly we know how this president work he loves fame he loves famous people he I mean half of his cabinet people that he saw on TV but however and ended up hiring ... so it's kind of you actually pulled his attention to this issue\nThen then so be it I don't think he authentically passionate about prison reform well I think he liked the idea of meeting like hanging out is\nI think ... I think he has a meeting with entertaining and I don't know if you notice that thank you very for that call and I'm not to go to break up gets caught here but I did notice one other thing which is he did convene a prison reform panel that's how I I I went to North Dakota and worked for the governor there I noticed he was on that panel and I was looking very carefully at\nOne African American gentleman all white guys otherwise I thought wow that's not how you feel like I I just thought that that that's the kind of ... so it kinda fits with that kind of\nMm not exactly looking at the form

get it part of the head of the spotlight on it\nAnd and a lot of it the media conditioned people to think he's like oh it's a race like\n... and the trunk of contributes to his own\nExample uh Thirteen to ... you know the media does not work what ... what I knew about it because of the labor it's constitutionally allowed by the coaching bullet where's the news I say\nWell the problem with tiny wasn't really actually dealing explaining that he said we should abolished Thirteen amendment and we're assuming what he meant was the idea that prison labor as they can to to the modern day\nDenis says that she wants to abolish the cut in and it's\nLike well they didn't then it though they caught him but\nTony I get what your point is your overall point is that a opinion and spin colors the eventual perception of the public and generally\nMore laterally especially now all they yeah if you guys you guys know what's happening it's clear to anybody who's watching the news I mean it's so evidence\nWell there was a data using yesterday or day before the show the Ninety seven percent of any ... any media coverage of drugs all Trump was negative Ninety eight Ninety two bigger prize way off and say\nOkay I get like a population that right yeah people wearing those hats riding in cars are we saying that they all think exactly the same of course they do this plenty do support it but they know what will happen if they publicly express it that's why they don't\nWell I always the one thing that Kanye was saying that I thought was an extremely positive message was think for yourself I thought that was really where you should keep his message\nMessage I appreciate what saying hey President Trump can we change the slogan instead of make America great again which angers a lot of us and the black community can we just have it they make America great because you're implying that you know before when we had such a terrible history and America then\nYou're going to write him grow so great yeah uh yeah so good maybe ... maybe ... maybe the next time around it will change I I'd be interested that'd be fascinating if they if he does changes overall slogan but Tony thanks

in his car he had just finished celebrating at a friend's apartment his mother says he moved here from Chicago to pursue his dream of playing professional basketball\nThat any woman my thighs or otherwise would be intimidated you know to try and get around him or get away from him but aside from that many of these women believe that he was the key to their entire careers that they would lose their job they would lose any opportunity they have or they would never gain any opportunity if\nThey didn't listen to what he said and I don't know you know obviously he lost his job he's no longer the head of his company we thought the same thing happened with like Les Moonves but then when he goes into court there was a much different\nSet of um\n[noise] what would you call them are very red criteria and so how do you change that criteria without allowing perhaps a victim to get away with lying back then you know because I think the worst fear right now for men in this country is that they will be accused of a false allegation\nAnd that a woman will try and get back at them or exact revenge on them so now with the with the false allegation and so if if in a court of law were saying well he did a very an abuse of\nPower on her but she didn't necessarily say no I don't know how he would differentiate those two things\nYou've got to understand that that is all true and uh either but the thing is I think what we're learning from the point that we need to encourage victims to come forward earlier rather than later because what happens is even though there's no war statute of limitations on stage\nYou get the jury to scratch your head and ask why didn't you come earlier right we know and the winds in case people didn't come earlier because\nThere was no way to come to it\nThere's nobody to come to the devils are silenced by the prospect of maybe just maybe I might get the acting job but I think what happened why seeing I think the dam broke when all these women found out a including the actually the actors are that you know he was sabotaging people's careers on purpose if he's in ...\nBut we have to go back to that poor Italian woman ... model who got him on audiotape harassing her and she brought that to the police and in twenty Fifteen and that literally went nowhere\nBecause he was such a powerful man he owned journalists he had a raft of lawyers I mean for these young budding actresses who are they going to go to and report that tip\nAnd you don't want to get blacklisted as an ... you start doing that if you start causing problems then you know who's going to want to hire you and that's another issue\nYeah and then there's yeah this is a national thing well I think the causing problems I'm sure it's something that goes through people's minds when they're wondering what to do with this myth that we discussed before men all the time to think about this when they're harassing the workplace I like I Need to get to the next job I Need the recommendations person I Need whatever ... who's going to deal with\nThose I hadn't down yeah and helping all works out I mean in my case uh\nWhen I had my encounter with hand\nHardy once in ... there was nowhere to report that too I mean if I went to the police I didn't have any hard evidence that would have been my word against they wildly powerful man\nI'm and there was no upside for me I mean I I wasn't even trying to be an actress I just didn't want to be you know bother it or or called worse or ... or anything like that I meet\n... ... but a secret is what I find so fascinating is that
