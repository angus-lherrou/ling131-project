be ... let's put it this way\nI had a I had a guy called the show a couple of years ago he goes I got I was homeless and now I drive a truck and I'm doing great and he goes I Know exactly what homelessness needs it needs a like a place of four walls and you can get better and food but mostly it needs to be populated by doctors and nurses and psychologists and social workers vocational rehabilitation\nSpecialist material that's just like you have to start to Costco and yes what's called something else ... whatever you want but absolutely that's what's needed\nAnd the problem is you know what the kind of ... we have a shortage of hospitals you have a shortage of psychiatrists we don't have any situation for the long term chronically mentally ill and we don't have any way of

I Would I where I was going to say though was I like beer so [laughter]\nSo so but you but you you got my mind spending a little bit about the court in and help me with this a bit because as you said you're a liberal but there is sort of a new ideology that that I hear people talking about that I Would have been characterized as leftist that different than liberal\nSo there's conservative liberal and leftist right in my in my I write about that\n... a leftist to progress as I mean I guess if you could spin at the opposite way you have the kind of like the Tea Party on the right side\nAll right okay but but when we talk about the Supreme Court they're all fairly moderate or we're not we're not talking about Tea Party and left us on the court no\nYeah no I mean there are some key issues there you know some cases that are coming up right now regarding voting in Germany ... gerrymandering but\nYeah I mean it's not like there's no left it there was no Tea Party people on the court\nRight um and so we're talking about smart people the word that have certain political points of view that I'm certainly color of their thinking but we want them to use their good thinking and there are legal jurisprudence and their training to make good decisions are\nSaying this decision that Kavanaugh in the circus that surrounded it as well as you know the treatment of Merrick Garland just sitting on his nomination does that take away the legitimacy of the Supreme Court or does it eroded in any way in European\nNo because I think what happens and you know with history itself and what happens in journal so I'm whether you're a Democrat or Republican the pendulum swings back and forth right in always become center so I think it's going to happen now is chief justice Roberts is now going to be the middleman late\nKennedy was the lady was conservative but each vote on a lot of liberal social issues\nAnd I think that's going to happen I think the Supreme Court will make an adjustment\nSee that Michael I'm Glad you said because it's so hard to judge history\nAnd impossible to judge it on a single event or appointment or even a brief trend ... history is far more complex it's almost trying to it's almost like to make sense of chaos it's very very difficult time I'm Glad to hear you say that that that there could be should be some adjustments there was a quick call from Mike Mike go ahead\n[noise] yeah I'm I'm having a hard time justifying Brett Kavanaugh a white man by saying that Christians are they told the truth why do we still except that she told the truth\nIs the other

well he made he music or like our discovered uncover not\nRound it's not an ... would be fair memory and that would be not well hold on every but hold on to the American I got to hold on\nNot what it why didn't know what she describes she\nWill but we don't have the doctor's notes so we don't know to be fair we don't know we have what she said she sort of said he came to her in therapy we don't know what the weather the doctor considered her a pressure memory or not\nBecause they may have looked different from the doctor's perspective then from the patients perspective but from her perspective it was something that had been on her mind for a long time that she finally told someone in therapy\nHer past memory and something that you had no you're not only out uncovered not young turns out in therapy correct\nFor him just interject one thing here remember that\nShe I I Believe she told the truth a lot of geo PIN numbers believe she told the truth I'm of when after she gave her testimony President Trump basically he believed or because of compelling testimony the issue is\nWas that Kavanaugh as as the perpetrator right so people believe that she was sexually assaulted and so\nI was going on now in ...\nIt and people said well no it was a cab all must have been so so\nWhatever I I think we are better off assuming that when people put themselves in to the public uh scrutiny like this assume there tell them if you out but I think that's a good assumption to make I I ...\nYou know some people in ... into the color you know some people may want to argue that OK well she's received nine hundred thousand dollars and go but money but as a whistle blower attorney ... are you right now she's had death threats that she's a method to ...\nLet me ask you about that Michael but all we had another attorney Don not too long ago um who said that when men don't understand why women take so long coming forward why they don't know why they don't say anything at the time\nWhy they keep quiet for Twenty years when it's your income on who said look at men when it comes to whistle blowing a lot of than sit on what day now for a long time because they have to weigh all of the risks to their family to their career X Y and Z would you agree with that that you've seen men exhibit the same behavior\nI mean can put completely let me tell you so as you guys know I'm I was there was a bargains being mess\nI'm poor kickbacks to physicians when in two thousand so and they settled with the deejay for five or ... million and then recently about sixty and they said look thirty million with the state of California that they see the California Department insurance now I\nCame out because I was being retaliated against I had other coworkers who had such more damning evidence so then I did\nBut they do not want to speak up they were in fear or their career right there is here because\nThey have family that had our food on the the\nThese are the only that with any bears that women have but when it comes to ... to correlate exactly\nIn it so that that that applies the same with ... you know with other people to why did take or so you know so law ... you know because I was right or probably\n... was it worth it at that time no on but just because she didn't come out and and because of the other people didn't come out that doesn't invalidate you know I Would say the truth the truth when there is of of her being sexually assaulted let me give another example\nUm I've had other cases I've settled if people walk around and they don't want to be deposed they said yeah I Know it's happening\nI Know what's going on this doctors that but I don't want to get involved\nMhm you know yeah and that's what happens and that's what happened with capital as friends I don't think that's the I really did a great investigation they could not have within a week but you know what\nHe'll do I would I Would tell you whenever the federal government comes around I Will ports user case a Manafort you they ... they could start asking questions you get yourself in trouble that's why people don't want to participate in these things\nNot the metaphor didn't deserve all that around day I'm just saying with the feds come around people like art on deal with this one or the or the guy who knows what they'll farts who knows what I'll say I could get in trouble\nThey let me just say this though and you know everyone was talking about the FBI investigation as a chef but you know kind of really whose fault is that as the Democrats because he sat on

in the southern\nRegion they didn't want to get their period at the beach no it's not that that goes for something to do with plankton analogy and things like [laughter] a little different but does speaking of a critters\nAh I Do want to do go a little deeper into this uh epidemic we're having here of endemic type is find a I knew this would happen it could be it could go no other way we have an ecosystem here in Southern California particularly\nWhere we have a reservoir of rodents typically rats possums raccoons and feral cats that had fleas that always have a certain amount of our cats you on them and so this type is organism gets into the fleas the fleas if\nThey are on rats and the rats overpopulate the region and the rats get out into the periphery of our communities into the suburbs and whatnot\nThose rats with their ... get on our pets they fleas than are have feces that they leave behind on our pet so when we had our pets and\nRub our eyes do you go into our I we get the Rick ... organism get a PET scan it today 'cause they don't get it they can then and it's not\nThe human transmitted it is wrapped fleet vector\nAnd because we have had a an insane blossom in the rap population and I've seen it specifically in my backyard in Pasadena so I knew Pasadena was going to get a bad case go downtown Los Angeles the rats out number the homeless tend to what\nThey do so because there are dumps on either side of the encampment and until the cameras are cleared the rodent population is not going to change and will continue to grow period and\nSo this ... outbreak is not going to stop until the rodent population is stopped now the next piece we don't have so much of this but what could happen\nThere have been a couple of cases reported in California I Believe the ah\nMight've been Colorado had double checked out of something called epidemic ... which is life sport is on the lights and as someone who took care of lots lots of homeless people over the years life as a major major problems there\nAre so the lice will begin to transmit epidemic typist which spreads much more easily and much more readily we have not seen it really in this country since\nThe civil war little bit in the first World War a but we're really going to do this now and then I Would predict\nYou wouldn't is there any way to like and knock you late are homeless population\nOr there's no there is a ... maybe a vaccine to her for epidemic tired of this but there is not one for endemic temperature our so called ...\nThe symptoms of me right type of should you get this and it happens in all age groups everybody all the elderly that I've taken care of that got me right Titus ended up in the hospital\nMy own son had ... during the last rap bloom and that bloom happen because we had a huge homeless and cabinet under the in the royal in Pasadena and the rats took advantage of that of course\nNow again\nYou have people suffering on the streets overrun by rats\nYou think that's okay everybody this is no way in a day when the homeless this is an indictment on our system at our willingness to help people that we're allowed to languish and suffer in the streets\nAnd the second the secondary complication of that is going to be major infectious disease outbreaks as you allows civilization to unwind\nBasic sanitation is why we have cities you have allowed that to that decline completely unravel and ... it's so it's going to come it's going to come there may be more serious infectious disease outbreaks here norovirus you have your ...\nAnd all you need to do is expand gravy disabled and expand conservative ship is all you got to do very simple and people can be helped people can be brought back into the workforce people can be and and again there there are a we're not talking about the population of\nCabinet couch but do they call them couch their servers that kind of thing and people that are temporarily homeless and this sort of thing we're talking about the chronically mentally ill because the the average person to temporarily homeless is not going to be\nIn a condition where they're going to get one of these endemic conditions are just not right and they're not going to be living with the rodents and those kind of stuff it's when you are so disturbed\nBut when you hear about those that neighborhood up in San Francisco and how they are openly selling drugs inching cells up and he was ... I mean this just seemed like the tip of the iceberg it's only going to get way that's right\nThat's right and in San Francisco is not yet had its outbreak it's it's coming they've had their list we've had hepatitis hey we have him or a say in some communities\nAnd ... but the the the things that have vectors that can really cause epidemics that's the stuff you've got to worry about and that's where it's going to come that's where it's it has to because we now have the rodent population\nThat supports that that's why in medieval Europe there was the plague\nBecause they couldn't control the road population now we know how to do that and we decided we're not going to do it on the floor it's upon Dr ... alive\nOr smell good plumbers at my diamond will clog your dream for Ninety nine dollars [noise]\nStoppage and stopped bodies aroma friendly technicians can save money for prevent flooding inside your home and remove all unnecessary Marie from your life's\nDream dream recently here ... blows loser and your face and then we'll be resold [noise]\nNinety nine dollar homes to operate applies to get some things\nMay lines were stopped isn't all five coronary arteries scheduling\nTo play with today's remind them show up on time [noise] professional ... better than a new car wrapped in [noise]\nYou will be able to get back to life sooner focused on things that really matter to avoid the unsanitary atrocities of Chrysler [laughter]\nBy the ... got to drain reference and Ninety nine dollars stoppage page has a smell good plumber dot com they all have hundreds forsake my contract or lots of other you know this is my time and then I hear and see my plumber will show up on time and smell the smoke is free [noise]\nHey it's Peter ... and you know the fall season this year already and you know what happens in the fall mission road jumps has his fall clearance sale this does not happen often it's maybe once or twice a year that he has a clearance sale Mitch saves you at least fifty percent every day on all the jewelry and store right now who say you even more on diamond rings earrings dependents necklaces imports the diamonds directly\nIs more master craftsman make all the join house that you never never pay for a middle man you say big on everything in the store bigger than ever\nAnd he specializes in customs through to all repairs can be done in forty five minutes or less while you watch and wait and right now you'll say fifty percent on repairs there are not many stores like this in the country that make all the jewelry in house and said you so much money plus you rip out a picture from a magazine you can do that to Mrs\nWorld gems at Seventeen to a five and ... in the plaza de or across needs you know comments look for the arch he's open Monday through Saturday tend to six something other times by appointment the phone number eight three four seven Seventy nine Seventy four but going in person and see the enormous savings going his fall clearance sale at Mrs workshops images of royal gym to\nDowntown Los Angeles known by its acronym the tea LA is an emerging hotspot just waiting for upscale residents like you that love the convenience of fine dining in great entertainment just steps from the front door\nSound like you revere real estate DCLA first real estate for South park of LA has relationships with builders of new construction that will get you first viewing visit free brokered dot com to schedule your viewing free broker dot com\nBeyond expectation real estate surface\nFree broker dot com\n... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police\nAnything close to the restroom\nMiddle seat with the stomach problem\nMy fear of flying\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called ... efficiency or eat PI even if you don't know when he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea\nYes bloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy PI because not everybody experiences E. pi on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\nA piano is manageable some don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...
