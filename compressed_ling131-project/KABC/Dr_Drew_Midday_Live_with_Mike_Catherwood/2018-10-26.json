{"content": "It is a threat to that respect for law and process that allows people to accept legislation\nElections court rulings with which they do not agree\nThis is the central feature of our system of government you advocate for your beliefs enthusiastically but we peaceably unlawfully comply with the results\nPlease know that from the beginning this investigative team has made this matter a top priority focusing their great talents and expertise on neutralizing this threat they moved swiftly and professionally\nUsing extraordinary technical expertise to apprehend the one alleged responsible [noise]\nThis is a demonstration of the skill capability and determination of our American law enforcement the best in the world\nSo I Am pleased to participate in this announcement that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone not to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he has been charged today\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation proceeds\nThis is a law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nAnd so I Want to thank FBI Director ray and his team all about law enforcement partners to I hear ATF Secret Service postal inspectors Capitol police\nAre on in New York City police department and the United states attorney Berman on the southern district of New York and us attorney for the southern district of Alabama Ariana or some\nFederal state and local law enforcement officers from across this country responded immediately to the cause and contributed to this effort we are proud of each one of them\nI Want to read or write to defend it in this case is innocent until proven guilty\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further and agenda\nWe will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and now director right or who's done an incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of today's important arrest\nChris [noise]\nEternity general as confirmed\nWe have the rest of the seas are say off in connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive what I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of it\nGreatest importance our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division and our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut but and I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today a threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder\nAnd today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nThat requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort in getting those devices to our lab from around the country and we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IDs for center various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material that gives off heat and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprint from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to Congress will and Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that for the seas are saying\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close and reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick were\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every day to try to keep the American people safe from harm\nAnd who moved quickly and efficiently into action every single time\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now and other packages on ... so we need the help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us our tip line at one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips dot FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important\nAnd of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nProtecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans not like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from then why did [noise]\nLike Chris\n... every one of the men and women are the NYPD quite frankly all people in New York City I Want to commend and thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement partners in his efforts including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives alone with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force\nThe J ... New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City in YPG doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD that's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger\nThis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service unit or intel bureau or kind of terrorism bureau\nOr patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset and we would identify and arrest the person or people responsible for these acts\nThat was interesting [laughter] did you first president\nTable\nIs the president I Will say that I received a very nice congratulatory call from the president shortly before heading over here\nA and saw his remarks that he made at the White House and I think he like every American is and should be proud of the unbelievable work was done not just by the FBI but by all of our law enforcement partners across multiple states\nAnd the side of the commissioner O'Neill set it well the partnerships that exist in the law enforcement profession right now in this country a artist\nOrdinary are better than they've ever been and it's ... with a doctor or for this country the same as much\nIt of arise you more of what the doctor ordered this was ... to keep the seat and before we get on with the news which of course we've just been listening to the CNN feed of the Justice Department\nPress conference regarding their arrest of the ... they called the or the right guy the guy that to perpetrated these bombing throats what a guy he is\nOne guy is and why he was walking around and not in prison is confounding and we will talk about that more of a hundred will do some dedicated here's your chance to win one thousand dollars now directs the national key word happy a trip you are to the number nine private or not that's happy to not invited one I'd be shocked we will take you back in primary\nData MSU where it's very ... very new to him three as of Medicaid we see a ... a thirty minute about something as\nWell just hearing to this press conference they believe they got their men and their man is saves are out here ...\nWhat kind of name that is well she claims that he is a a Native American and according to a picture he posted on earlier that means anymore exactly it'll have not seen has twenty three me but he claims he's part of the seminal tribe of Florida okay or information from his linked in page suggest that he's Filipino\nOh it was some sort of ... don't occur SARS uh other things we've learned about him just in the last couple of hours since he's been caught he is a promoter for a male strip tease troop for a trip and Dale are good for him\nAnd he claims he's enrolled in a veterinary medicine program because he wants to be a horse doctor whatever that means now my full time 'cause he's busy ... that's great for your listeners that question to you is this guy was driving around Florida\nHe'd been arrested a I mean there's just a laundry list of charges years going back to the nineties and the two thousands never served any jail time for them even though they seem like pretty serious crimes William ethic dispute domestic violence and\nBattery assault and we're in Florida and California was apparently that's our sister say oh when it comes to keeping people out of\nPrison committing crimes well funny how that works to tailor their criminals that are not in prison they commit more crimes\nWe have bombs going out to all of these Democrats yeah this guy is rolling around Florida and it's white sketchy than a Swiss literally the same people that are\nGetting bombs with crosshairs on their faces sites like like like a light from the sniper yeah and then he has pro Trump bumper stickers everywhere CNN sucks stickers all over\nThe I mean everyone congressionally that they found him so quick what took so long ago I was there any others I've heard that anytime screaming it's neat I mean one of the news broke\nThat it was even in Florida he didn't think like maybe I should give it a van and break and put it into a girl that's true that's true however on around them that he\nDid have some drug arrests which to me ... brings up the specter of methamphetamine well that was back in two thousand square brings I don't know whether he doesn't look like recovered guy put it that way and uh but here's my thing is my ... my ... river toward it would cause engine of drugs with intent to distribute which a lot of those guys are\nNever using drugs course right yeah well there are so oranges laboratory to um have you ever driven around the streets of silver Florida oh yeah that was shrimp place about stuff like this that's for you know what those people try to hit you when you cross the street or they literally you'd be shocked but it's like to go to cross walk\nNo I don't I Know but if I saw this van parked anyway I like to get a look at this guy but Dr ... grand like depending on\nWhat happens if you don't know maybe that's what else are we going to absorb but anyway yeah well\nThese are all here ... and if he is not the guy paint me shocked\nI Would love it if the story be complete as some of the bill strippers are the ones that cold and I would love that whether it be go to the love that no more\nA former well I'm just glad relive here's the deal but cigarettes off law enforcement yes of course they didn't really they are already\nJob no one was injured it was it is it's a great yeah love me some NYPD let me the commission I Love all of the ocean between local and federal nice to see the FBI get restored to his stature of sort of normal city it started doing their job\nYou have to give him credit and respect for I I I Do want us to I mean the president said that we're you know we're glad this they have\nTheir man and [noise] but um I I Would like to see him somehow you know\nUnify us after this after what was undoubtedly a really tense political week when on both sides\nI Would not hold my breath however I Will do like\nThe idea that the FBI does not look so political at the moment and although they do the job I mean but it just it settles just just from my standpoint of persuasion in people's emotions it seemed I felt like it's settled some of that to see the FBI Director doing a job but it felt good to see that that's what I'm saying\nWhy because the president didn't come out and immediately call him stupid or low IQ or whatever it is I have a good old on President Trump and not well no I'm not I'm not no no no no I'm not giving him credit for doing their job to job well done yeah why would the directors anything ... I mean they usually don't know but\nWhen you look for a children's morning when I saw the FBI or had all kinds of feelings like what all the craziness around what went on and I I don't know what that was I don't\nI don't know what you're referring to a ... call me was one of the first and only FBI directors that I remember that actually came out and make political statements I've never seen FBI daughters I\nKnew I don't I don't disagree with anything you're saying I'm just saying that from a primitive emotional ... my emotions shifted a little bit and I wasn't aware that I was having ... called me and if you are but to see the FBI directors incompetent to stand up and do the job and that we're worried about Quantico are not good politics good\nGood fight I feel better okay it's often glad you feel oh my God\nBombs so it's one of the nicest guy I've ever met that's one of his attorneys which I put a lawyer so I think so this is ...\nLawyer what are the nicest guys I've ever represented\nWell uh I think we are to take a little bit more public\nOf what kind of statement is that right that guides interested for the weirdest\nThing I've ever heard of before tried to get a defense or a form\nOf by alright Megan Kelly of course she loves her job yesterday was announced that they are canceling Megan Kelly today now making Kelly is demanding a fifty million dollar settlement from NBC um she's about a day away from settling and we're learning that uh NBC with paying or twenty five million a year [noise]\nThe network may end up settling for close to fifty million uh sources close to the investigation said making deals three years from and she has around a year and ten months to go\nHer lawyer Bryan for even it's going to have to have a call with NBC breath and demand and the networks pay her full remaining salary or face a lawsuit\nWe're told Freeman's cases that Kelly was targeted early on after she made critical remarks about Matt Lauer on her show after she was fired for sexual harassment Lauer was well liked at NBC staff and talent became really pissed off a Kelly because they felt\nShe was attacking Lauer quote with Lee ...\nUh now the African American employees or people of color that at NBC that work with Megan Kelly are angry according to the daily now that she's playing this me to card to collect her sixty nine million dollar pay out\nOne uh NBC employee of colors that how dare she who the hell does she think she is another one said her black they've comments were bad but fall asleep playing the meat to card is the worst form of white privilege I've ever seen I'm not sure that's quite prevalent\nNow you're trying to get I'm trying to understand what the what did she heard she use me\nToo I she's saying that because you came out against Matt Lauer during the media to stuff when he you know left because it's actually interesting that are attorneys saying that you know what I mean well her attorney but that's the case they're making of why should she get out of is an attorney for another employee remark she had no respect for the African American staff on her team at her apology was the fake\nAnd dismissive now there's rumors that no one like that that is the second she walked in the door she already had the\nCard stacked against her um and so I'm not surprised to hear people coming out now in saying these things\nBut as the person who does not work at NBC and did not know what she was like I I I Do think she's getting a raw deal here I think that\nUm she's unfair\nFully you know their trumping they thought maybe that's why much bigger thing than if she had the ratings I don't think she would\nBe absolutely not but maybe that's why they're going for the sexism stuff because it does feel a little 'cause he's so trumped up you know what I mean the way of an attorney stuff it's not necessarily ... attorney so All right\nLet's see thirty minute or so it was more of a very interested in that I

I agree and\nInteresting and and and somebody else yesterday who's paying for those anyway and I are that occurred to me is that we are important question well ah what do you think you Frank and bill what are you sir\nFor real Yeah Bill\nYeah I I think that Maxine Waters should be a cold out on this she ... and she's a racist and she says it in all of the things that she does she promotes violence scandal\nYou noted violence but she said why that's ... can you give me an exact ...\nExplanation and because I think I Know what you're referring to but she wasn't necessarily violence she was encouraging people to harass those eating out\nAnd tell isn't that violence is a form of harassment for sure but she doesn't explicitly withhold for violent\nShe she ... this stuff\nBut soon as the president so I don't understand how you can call her out and not not burned down his comment you guys I think\nWe'd all be on in safe territory to say that all sides either to diminish their rhetoric would we not there'll be rebel\nI Would agree but Maxine Waters is the one that promotes should more than anybody else\nOkay ... and I but I think I Would disagree with you I think bill you're the one you hear it that way I'm not sure there's more I'm sure there's worse out there uh alright Camille are a little bit up against the clock here about give you a chance to go ahead okay\nYou know what Maxine Waters was wrong but the president only as an operation day is in the same way he's acting twenty two months later\nThe Republican Party it could have chosen to go in and stand up\nAnd the president and tell him a lot of this has something to do with you and your rhetoric\nIt should not be allowed to go on those rallies and run 'em up against a citizen I feed that which didn't base and it's just like the other day when all this on the edge color Chicago station and it went up on you talked to a few really when I launched the by saying that\nYou guys wasn't digging up you weren't looking at a lot to bend it but as an editor or saying it's wrong\nAren't real thanks so much for the call I think she was actually coming on us for it was the other way around the other way around

o'clock I'm ... widow authorities say that the man arrested in South Florida Today in connection with at least fourteen pipe bomb sent the Democrats and critics of President Trump\nIs fifty six year old says are say Iraq was a long criminal history in Florida correspondent Renee ... say I was arrested more than a half dozen times in the sunshine state\nYeah well I think people are even talking about now like what crimes as he actually committed says the bike just didn't go off were there any actual threats contained in there and I think\nIt was very it they didn't live coral usually ends are dumb anything that even looks like a bomb to people like that and to public figures and drive around with the band that has as you said cost chairs on the on the head didn't bodies out of\nPublic figures that he doesn't like that that in of itself is a threat\nAnd I think an essay and like I was standing on the desk clock that you know I don't\nThink he's going to say that all I but I Do think that we're going to we're going to see some you know interesting legal arguments going up a\n... it's going to be on the mental health side I bet you but I I even I who who likes that liberally interpreted even that with this kind of behavior\nYou know my my thing always is look he if he his chance to be treated as a medical patient was before he did this\nAnd once you do this now it's up to legal system period that's it you should have got great my quite some time ago and you did not now it's on you and the legal system will take care of it because we can't have you amongst us if you're not going to take care of yourself and clearly he's not\nThe only thing I was talking with a few minutes ago with the former ah what was he has a ... not just returned he was a former U.S attorney us during this process for us attorney\nAbout the profile of the loan or the perpetrator in in America we we we have that a lot we we in our head I think we expect big conspiracies but the reality is the troublemakers are all really mostly if not almost always these loner males is that true\nWell I I think so and in in in this type of case I mean you have to look at the\nThe typical bomber and I think a great example is if you go back to the mad bomber of New York at that that was in the Nineteen forties or fifties and he started out with a dispute with the utility company exactly\nLike this guy right into renting to bomb them and he didn't like him down and her final\nWhere let's let's say we haven't stated a a you know I talked about it off the air described that history or anti doesn't do he threatened to bomb Florida power in light of his inability to high right so that's where it all started racking for that and and so again in terms of being a profile you look for these patterns where there's that pattern that on Nineteen fifty or forty\nRight now it doesn't you know it all the previous ... New York and about the same thing\nYes he did exactly the same thing he went on to a long campaign of actual bombing and he hurt and killed a lot of people\nBut this guy maybe he had planned that but he wasn't quite as sophisticated as you thought uh my understanding is that they were able to retrieve forensic evidence from some of the packages and use the cell phone to target and and plus she as I said is driving around a ...\nBill nationally exact thing I mean that's the way the insanity\nComponent comes and when I'm like you know what I'm saying that now that they're ... they're going to have maybe put down in the garage for a few days and then he pulled out\nWell I think they got 'em in a in a garage I don't know if he was trying to cover as bad\nOr him he was an auto parts of the ways yeah oh is that right I don't know tell us about that I don't know that the piece of the story he was caught doing what\nWe don't I don't know what he was actually doing but it was a an arm parts garage and uh I you know it's ... it's possible that he was trying to disguise what he had who knows but\nI also believe that that driving that around he must have been on literally hundreds of different ... surveillance cameras in in the areas that he deposited\nThese bombs so I think is going to be plenty of evidence to tie him if in fact the that is obviously still suspect that you didn't get convicted yet but\nEverything's pointing towards he he wasn't quite as criminally sophisticated as he thought he was a however I Will say that that\nHis band tells me\nCall them bumper stickers but actually they're very very well neatly arranged political hate posters basically on the windows\nHaji ... [laughter]\nThey go well what it is very well organized and I think that probably mirrors his personality I think he's he's probably don't see the guy and that's absolutely what you need to be when you're making bombs because the process of actually putting them together in a very dangerous so that's very many times\n... will blow themselves up or below their fingers off or things like that in the process of making them so it helps to be OCD\nTalking to Jim Clemente former if you're a profile CEO of ... productions he works for Bobby should cone or you know for the show as well and Jim sort of the conversation that everyone seems to want to have it I don't know we frame the conversation properly yet\nWhich sort of goes ... how is the political rhetoric affecting these people that are on the margins what should we be talking about is it pertains to our our politics today is is there anything to say about this\nWell I think the first thing before you even get to that true is not make this guy you know an anti hero some buddy that everybody sees up there isn't blows name up and put a big lights and everything I think we should\nSay he's a bomber and kind of forget about him as a person because we don't want to make it attractive to other people or the second thing that you mentioned is you know how does\nHow does you know discourse and uh it may be extreme discourse effect these kinds of outlying individuals well the problem is\nYou know especially if you have somebody who gets into the delusional space as you know they can they can experience thing it radically different than what actually happens so even if the\nDiscourse is just quite mild they could take it to the extreme uh we can't be responsible for all that but obviously hey I'm I'm the kind of person who thinks hey let's be civil yeah we're all going to have differences that's\nWhat makes America great actually the fact that we're from different cultures different perspectives and we should learn to work together a little better and anytime we\nDo route stream on either side of the fans we create the other side that gives them justification so the only way to stop it stop at yourself and then hopefully the other side will learn\nWell that's a that's a good point is we each must sort of check ourselves but I I feel like a lot of words are being spoken to this point and I'm not sure it's following [noise]\nI'm not sure how it's being received a I I don't know because you look at social media and a bar and you've been saying I I don't even look at me right now 'cause I don't want to see it but you're saying it's still pretty ...\nOh yeah yeah I came home and now there's a lot of the I told you sell all over an hour and the people that I didn't want to believe it was on a person you know influenced by Trump um I I have no idea what will bring this country together but I Do hope that the president take this opportunity to say\nI'm or just to say nothing maybe just to tone down what he's been doing at these rallies because I don't hold him responsible of course this guy was doing when he wanted to do and I just don't think his rhetoric has been helpful and you know if you are on the edge and you are perhaps hundreds or suffering some kind of um mental illness\nIt's enough to put you over the edge when you hear the president constantly chanting you know CNN Saxon lock her up in that stuff\nYeah I it's just unfortunate and ah the only way that I can help\nAh is not participated in it at all\nI agree I agree with that that's I think that's the proper way to do it Jim thank you where should we look for you\nAh well ah you can look at ... production dot com I got an episode of criminal mine's coming out of December fifth and I have my pod cast best case worst case a laundry and anywhere he listened to broadcast thank you so much Jim All right take care\nYou've got a gym Clemente former of your profile or see your extreme productions our number here is eight hundred to two to five to ... to do give us a call what are your thoughts on I mean\nIt's so easy to go all Trump's rhetoric but but now what now what do we do what do we do how what you might want to maybe he should just knock it off I yes maybe he should but all I've got his me right now and and you were in in the end of the ability to change ourselves I Can't change here I'm\n... I'm not planning on bombing anyone knowing no [laughter] I don't need to be changed you know you're missing my point or we're going to talk to retire to free\nEspecially in the age of the top of the hour or he's going to talk to a similar topic to us and in a few minutes after the news break we will talk to Dr Bryan Russell we've psychologist and attorney a judge now is in order to ... of the jinx to stand trial and the murder case and that's\nKind of live 'cause he loved very female when I'm In his last card absolutely that's part of what my concern is\nHurt and then saw a very loud bang\nAnd a flash up like after the flash bang that's when he sold multiple law enforcement agencies moving in including the FBI and New York police made appear\nTo go down relatively easy and their suspects had kind of a demeanor of looks like they got me I'm done\nFiore says he's not sure how long saying or his band had been parked in front of the auto zone James Rojas KBC news\nDetectives investigating the stabbing death of a woman and a shooting death of a man in Linwood around nine o'clock this morning that's in addition to the murders of two men yesterday afternoon and Lin wood well today's deaths occurred in the forty two hundred black of Carlin avenue according to the sheriff's department\nBut the victims names have not been released and no arrests are reported\nA Santa Ana man was fatally injured when he was struck by a speeding vehicle last night while standing next to his car and south cedar street in Santa Ana\nPolice investigating the possibility the driver may have been street racing sixty eight year old Jose Martinez was killed when the Nineteen year old driver of a BMW apparently lost control while avoiding a car that was stopped in the middle of the street\nThe teen also slammed into by park vehicles before stopping after hitting Martinez\nNow the teen cooperated with investigators and provided a blood sample and that does not appear that he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol police are looking for the driver of another car to determine if they were street racing at the time talk radio seven Ninety ...\nABC for the world series now shifts to Chavez Ravine for the next three games starting with game three tonight when the Dodgers will host Boston first pitch five o nine PM\nGame for also tomorrow afternoon five o nine flippers are in Houston this afternoon with the five o'clock tip off Lakers visit San Antonio tomorrow afternoon there will be looking for their third straight victory\nAnd that is sports on seven Ninety K.

I Want to give you admitted to tell me about family wealth navigator dot com\nSo we're going to talk about Robert jurors today and Robert ... is a perfect example of why this is needed because\nIf you look back at jurors history he was showing this functionality going all the way back to the early years of his life he did have some tragic things happen like the death of his mother when he was ten years old but\nWhen he was left with millions and millions of dollars when his\nFather passed away he was left in a position where he was enabled to live a life of socio apathy and so if there are any wealthy people listening who want to learn how not to set their kids up especially if their kids have shown some tendencies towards the\nAudi not set them up to be the next ... or even just to to to be continuing on and they're just functionality their drug addiction their their criminality whatever they\nAre going to prevent them from a slight case of affluence\nYeah exactly and I felt that it is but he was definitely had suffered from something they did not\n... yeah it had a uh\nProfessional notes even at the age of ten that he was showing signs of potentially even that the person know to schizophrenia developing now that was probably too early to really\nKnow that but clearly there were some behavioral problems that warranted attention even at the age of ten it and and clearly that has played out throughout his life and too much more serious problems\nAbsolutely he seemed to have been a wood skews or effective in a way of describing his sort of lifelong process and maybe even tell people what that is if that is in fact accurate\nIt it might fit skits affective disorder is sort of a combination of some psychotic symptoms like we normally associate with schizophrenia and disorder symptoms that that's the aspect of part\nAnd so yeah certainly when you just look at you and I have noticed before you know when you just look at their worst um UC elements of both of those just yesterday and the hearing out in LA he was interrupting the hearing with the outbursts and that looks more sort of like psychotic stuff but then also he other times he just looks\nAlmost cat atomic and that looks like aspect of stuff you've noted before also that he does appear to have had some some organic stuff a brain\nU.S Britain very here you've got you could see how the shirt on where you can see the ... well that one point that's permanent did you can see it under his skin when it gets them and he's very park and Sony are and in terms of the slow shuffling way he gets about so it was like multiple things going on her and her aside gastric way why now they decided to proceed\nSo for a for our listeners uh it's been a while since we've talked about the jurors case so ah maybe I should take back into the way to bring him up to speed\nHere we've got about ... minutes we're going to break will keep going but give me give me a two and a primary here\nOkay so uh ... was a a wealthy kids from New York City who uh went off to college came back to a New York city got married and the wife disappeared a back and\nGosh this was Nineteen eighty two the wife went missing and was never found and then he divorced her quietly in Nineteen eighty two are so sorry that was eighty two she gets period Ninety they got divorced\nUm then in two thousand the cops were reopening the case of ... wife disappearance and at that point Susan Berman with whose murder ... now charged and was going to stand trial after yesterday's hearing\nA guy and and the allegation is that ... killed her because one of the cops reopen the investigation into the disappearance of his wife\n\nBeverage with President Trump or an impromptu or out on the White House lawn Bryan served to interrupt you there\nThat's a that's an and Trump's obviously they're talking to president there obviously talking about or you know the capture of the suspect and the the package bomb right on\nAs far as you go to your comments about that whole story and what the profile described likely is\nWell you know the the two big theories being floated are you know one it's a it's an ideologically or as a guy\nVideo logically in agreement with the Trump agenda and opposes these Democrats who means that the packages and that and that's the motivation the other theory is you know he actually a is an anti Trump person who's trying to get to do this\nAnd that sort of off after you know\nYeah I I don't buy that one and I don't mind a ladder I I I think it's the former um and and I don't\nThink and by the way I don't think that means anything to do with the president I don't buy this idea that anything the president has said is get anywhere close to the kind of thing that would plop somebody who was not inclined to do something like this any way to go out and do it\nAll right well there you go that's the kind of think I was looking for Brian thank you so much appreciate it will look for your wealth

being president where a he was referring to a protester to take 'em out take his coat\nCover the the stance emerged in the\n... that was insightful but it was also kind of hung in cheek I felt but I Do feel that it is directly insightful when the comments of Maxine Waters who says get 'em up and brought them in public\nThe comments of Hillary Clinton saying we won't be civil until we win or forget who was said you know when when they're on the ground we kick them\nOut when he defended defended the men and who's running for Senate I Believe who are assaulted a reporter and he said that's my I've got\nAll that I'm Glad you mentioned that because I'm Still trying to leave that in my head that's directly as bipolar if that's\nJust I couldn't get more insightful than than some of the Democratic responses but you're absolutely right that both\nDonald Trump comes from ... background that you spent a lot of times you know grew up with a man I'm dead you know and they\nReally make a good president I mean he as the leader of our nation I think we're all Democrat or Republican looking for him to set an example looking for him to try and unify asked not to say more rhetoric and you know I think back to when I was growing up and evangelicals were very\nInfluential and powerful and I'm getting labels put on CDs an album that had rappers on him that explains it can they absolutely felt that they were inciting violence by um and I don't hear any word from them about anything that said either by the president or anyone\nHave ... ... here's here's some here here's why by a framed the question will ask question I was watching a friend of mine a former\nSecret Service agent who was saying you know and my business when you have to psychotic people and delusional people and somebody in a leadership position says do this or you should feel that\nThose delusional people saying hey he's tiki speaking to me I'm gonna do it and I thought to myself she has a point is that is that you know you have a responsibility we're leadership position for those that are very vulnerable\nAnd I just made me think about whether that rhetoric can be directly linked in some way by the way both sides you could make the same same about Maxine Waters and citing somebody else and we will cut both ways if we assume this to be\nTrue when he was literally just asked about his rhetoric and out in front of the White House and he told reporters quote I think I've been toned down I could really tone it up [laughter]\nThat's not what we want to hear I\nI I don't think it's good I I just I Am

I Know I Know I I I Know when or it's all good answer to that she is extremely bright so you take her on at your own risk\nUm but one thing I Would say I didn't take her I Know I don't understand and so I Would just set it up and the one thing I Wish I had taken her on taking over but it was she said that all mobs come from the left wing and I was just sitting here sort of thinking I don't think that's right and I looked it up and of course that's not right so that was my own criticism myself where is what is your criticism\nSo when Lauren asked talk to her about this this I'm a ... a little nervous right there is a ... of of the guy\nWho are critical [laughter] anyway I got punched from one of Trump's guys\nOh you're a reporter yes yeah yeah the guy was right by her response was he was an idiot he deserved it oh well you're a you know what is funny I did not there I didn't hear it and I apologize to unpack it out yeah I can imagine like I said a woman\nWho is dressed in miniskirts deserves something you know\nI absolutely agree and I agree with you too and I and I I did not I I thought I remembered most of the things she said that I was reacting to I don't remember that and I should have responded I I think she would have said I'm just joking if I had done something\nBut you're the appropriate answer either that's you're right you're absolutely correct and\nAnd if the left is you know weak and women lead the right you know they do these these broad brush strokes in order to take the attention off of them and I was hoping you would have ... do you understand that stuff\nYeah you're you're not wrong and and I this may be\nI don't know I mean I didn't try and tell her to the point that that that the president's rhetoric\nAlthough he cannot be you know held personally accountable for a crazy person who wants to do damage go out on the left us but the rhetoric needs you know to be toned down because he is the leader of our nation and that's not helpful\nAnd ants um response to that was well he's being funny and he's getting laughed at his rally where I I don't disagree with but I don't think that makes it okay on any on any level\nRight in and here's another thing you were telling me this one when you bring in culture on you're you're taking the responsibility and so John has every reason to take me to task of letting NBA managed to do but you do have fewer and\nSo I'm responsible for that but I'm not going to\nEnd is no slouch she's happy to debate what she Leno or as to debate people ends and that's why she is very bright and she studied up on things but it is to take another scenario I did think that her arguments were that week and that we could have probably taken her to have that much\nBecause I have no doubt eight hundred to two to five to ... to is the phone number Anthony Scaramucci coming in here and should we take Anthony Anthony also say and he's also a very nice person in in real life I'm ... and there's almost a different person or real life which I find fascinating is important\nAnd she's not one of them and she's fine she laughed a lot you can have a great time with her and she's not\nShe's she's not interested in yelling over you about her point she's really interested in having a dialogue and the debate and love truly love political discourse who really does she had the fire in the valley for it and so that's why I really enjoy hanging out with their because I Do enjoy discussing things that aren't getting her take on things\nAnd take it you know taking art attack when I don't agree with her and that's really what I Do I went to choose a different person\nShe knows that she said a lot of polarizing comments because she's also a lot of things that language that\nPart it feels like an amplification of some part of her so that I don't I mean she believes what she says yeah yeah oh no no but but I think she also ... takes extreme positions almost you know the way Trump does as a negotiating thing to start a conversation and you can you can argue her back she's not she's not on\nI think in ... and she's a lot funnier than Trump is I suggested that she writes in joke for him is if comedy is when he's going for peace rally did you say yesterday yeah [laughter]\nI think you're right a scare much his book is the blue collar president or going to hear what the news coverage has said about that we're taking calls at eight hundred to two to five to to do uh I Would like take some of these calls Steve can I go out now and then\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our
