Manhattan Institute Howard walk on the program it takes forever so ... that's what it is at issue here it's a rent control temptations should we resist or should we go ahead with this\nWe should absolutely resist it tell us why well you know everybody wants lower for ... which\nCan be tempting I can just vote at my rent lower that that's great let's just do that it gets a lot more complicated the whole idea is will it make rent and housing or affordable for more people well think about it for a second if you're a landlord and you have a place to read\nWhat do you rent you want to rent to people who really don't have a lot of money you're only going to get so much rent it it's going to be said no you're going to let somebody definitely is going to pay the rent is at the controls level so\nThat may be your margin you may going to be some sort of bankruptcy if you don't meet your demands but but it it just it's\nSo not\nNot how economics work I mean if we how about we fast tracked building a regulation or diminished regulation for low income housing and built them out and created increase supply and guess what would you agree supplied you decrease regulation\nHappens Howard what happens prices go down thank you [laughter] a lot\nI'm not even get a math and I know that\nRight I don't understand why people have to learn that lesson over and over and over again white smoke ... people\nWell you got a lot of folks in California and I spent a lot and Jose in the spring looking at this issue very closely\nAnd you know you got a house and uh it's worth a lot of money especially don't want a lot of competition you like have a supply of the things that has driven up the cost of California and\nWe got to have more building and some people are going to have to accept more building and that's the hard nut to crack that's why you got these people are going around saying you'd be yes in my backyard because they want their kids\nAnd firefighters teachers and everybody else modest income to help us live\nSure I I'm those sympathetic but if you're down in Los Angeles and San Francisco too to some extent that he hears the piece that I'm concerned about uh I'm sort of at my heart in my in my heart libertarian so I'm interested in these\nForces being allowed to play themselves out so people can't afford their housing the way it's always happened it's not going to have any differently this time\nBut what concerns me is California has been so Ramis and particularly Los Angeles and San Francisco Los Angeles particularly in fulfilling their obligations to uh maintain roads and allow us ability to move around our city and the park our cars so woefully remiss\nI worry that we're going to you know further exacerbated problem that they've left unattended for quite some time\nBut at the housing problem\nThe ... the transportation problem roads are already ways and you know all the they're they're putting putting us on road diets are the same time but they're increasing how's it going how's that work it of course that's gonna be a catastrophe and so why not good\nBecause it while I was going to say that what what's happening is that people of low income\n... control is supposedly going to be the magic bullet they're not going to get the rent controlled apartment they're going to be out in the old people who have the wreckage hold apartments are just going to stay put because they have such a good deal you're not going to have very many vacancies and the people of modest means are going to be living in the Inland Empire\nAnd they're going to be the ones on those bad roads that you're talking about taking the two hour drive to work if they're lucky\nThe other thing Howard I'm that you're right here is you know looking to New York for guidance and and their rent control and and how there's no guarantee that there was a low income benefit right now in New York you say that um it's regulated housing constitutes fully a third\nRight and and by the way the record for measure will actually inhibit the construction of new housing\nThe bankers the investment bankers who invest in in housing they're afraid to build new housing why they need a return on their investment and if they think they're going to get hit with record pool they are going to pull out of the state of California\nAbsolutely what about the argument that I see in all these political ad that um the elderly are going to lose their homes for us if you yeah if you rent control passes it I mean I've rented joke doesn't pass me than I Am you know I'm Out here I can barely afford to keep you probably haven't unless we pass rent control I Believe\nI think they're they're saying is if it on a fixed income and fixing some doesn't keep pace with rent\nSomething like that well the the argument or anything like that they're in rent oh go ahead\nHow if if you are renting if you recognize that unit and you're on a fixed income and your elderly ... that that's an accurate split chair\nBut if you're already ... unit would you know that it wasn't ... do do that with\nOkay they would it would be protected they're protesting so that it hard for it so I'm

some areas of the city\nCan really say says Twenty one businesses and the Venice area have closed in city hall is ignoring the problem\nAnd we also want to talk about a ... of course I'm you know the the audio tape has reached which basically it just seems like a really gruesome death of this man and now we have President Trump saying that and\nIt appears the missing journalist is dead I mean they're still calling him disappeared for for the most part out of the White House you know it seems pretty accurate to say completely dead but\nI mean he was at an early on point completely that I'm going to go ahead and put money on that one um uh but what did they do because it really does shake up that\nPower balance in the middle east if now President Trump does have to take action against the Saudi\nWell what would that be yeah she should be and this is the sticky part for it is everything turns out to be correct as is as has been recorded and we should bear in mind that the\nThe bulk of the places who have been doing the leaking of such information from state run turkey and Qatar who have a very big both sort of grind of their own when it comes to Saudi Arabia so which which Saudi Arabia we are still\nAre in favor of their reform plan because that's very important for U.S interests and ticket the kingdom to be reforms\nWhich would have a giant impact on the rest of the Gulf states in the Arab world um we're going to end up having to recalibrate how we handle working with the crown prince so that he doesn't feel that he can take advantage of us this way what we should not do is what is all is what is being right now promoted by those who are\nTotally in the Obama administration which is essentially we should completely cut off Saudi Arabia and then of course the corollary is to get back into the deal with the Ron so we'd be basically choosing the Iran regimes side as opposed to\nAll of our natural allies like Saudi Arabia we have to basically keep our own strategic interests in mind as grotesque as a a situation as this may be\nRight I was asking Lauren yesterday I mean we we know this is an oppressive regime we know it's a dictatorship we know they do horrible things to gay men and women and why we draw the line here why why is this where we suddenly go after them\nAnd keep in mind this guy was banned from Saudi Arabia me back in twenty sixteen I Believe for criticizing then candidate Trump and that's why he was banned from Saudi Arabia yeah\nThey've now and he's the king that couldn't be there mcgary other\nAnother winery and I mean that was one of them and he ... he was a former insider who with all of a sudden talking about you know insider and fame and they didn't like that and I get that but um again he was not an American citizen not that they may not have been living in murder any that everybody doesn't pass the sniff test for me\nBut I'm sure when you're when you're if you're looking at it from the Saudi perspective I'm sure they're thinking who's going to miss this guy you know\nThis is very true and obviously this is what has been going on in that part of the world for a long time I mean we're just talking about Syria okay there's half a million people who have been killed the media hasn't really seemed to care about any one of those civilians who have been killed by either chemical weapons attack\nCar bombs this is not sparked the kind of outrage this has occurred with someone who has a checkered past so when we were all fainting this moral\nIdea and kick carrying it over to a conclusion well when there for the United states should you know disrupted ... relationship with it thrown overboard its entire foreign policy which is to also them throw\nThrow overboard a lot of its allies in the middle east\nAnd then there's no real good explanation for what comes next to you know we need to be thinking ten steps ahead\nAnd needs to be making sure the Saudi Arabia knows this type of behavior is not going to be tolerated but they're not America's enemy to the extent that Iran who is building a would you feel has a nuclear program and wants to use them and paint on their missiles death to America that Israel and saw\nWhat about though the ... and the forces outside the u._s. government you have you know people pulling out of the middle east ... meeting I forgot what they're calling it and you have company saying they're going to have her all ties with Saudi Arabia I you know and Deborah pulling out of four hundred million dollar deal how much will that have\nHad any impact if any on Saudi Arabia I think it\nWill and frankly if you're being realistic about American foreign policy the bigger impact that people perceive that it has\nThe better I mean you see a lot of these companies are places in think tanks that are saying we're turning our our our Saudi money we're not going to this conference okay well they're still taking in millions also from Qatar okay what maybe they have a better record no toilets this selective outrage\nRight and it's a horrible situation but it didn't show to have people pulling for this conference that's good that sends a message to Saudi Arabia that there are consequences and perhaps there there'll be other consequences as well I mean\nIt's hard to spell out publicly what the appropriate slap or a appropriate penalty is so that it doesn't thoroughly undermined your own interest at the same time\nI I'm not even clear what the crime is yeah we are telling ourselves a narrative\nNarrative is a poor journalist who spoke up against his
