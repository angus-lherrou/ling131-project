{"content": "Tell us about that but also flash forward to the second cop trial in federal court and we talked about whether a jury can be fair could a jury really be fair in hearing the case against those crops knowing in the back and then the front in the middle of their mind that if they voted not guilty again and bad stuff and I have\nTo another riot yeah that was considered um the idea of going to federal court of doing it a civil rights prosecution\nYou know struck everybody is kind of double jeopardy although it's not legally and um and those jurors were questions backwards forwards and upside down about\nWhether they could be fair and I think they were dedicated to being fair it was a very tough trial it had different some of the evidence was different or new uh it was tried according to federal regulations which is you know are quite different\nAnd uh they did get some guilty verdicts which was what they want it\nBut the the first trial was just a disaster um and I think everybody's been remembering it this week because of the deaths of Daryl Gates and the and the fact that you know his behavior when the riots broke out but\nI was there and I remember sitting in that courtroom and as the verdicts were read the report is sitting next to me turn to me and she said I guess we're going to have to go cover riots now wow but as it turned out we couldn't because we were in semi valley and we could not even get back into the city\nOr the case was tried up there which was the first mistake\nYou know what though um I've tried a lot of jury trials I Wonder if you lost a few I think they get it right most of the time I really do\nMost of the time they do in that case it was pretty disastrous they didn't get it right and it was you know it was just monumental because it costs the city so many lives and so much money\nI think that particular case the public even the public will surprise I think the public believed that it would be found in Rodney King right\nA William Kennedy Smith you covered that can um the lawyer who defended him\nTo a black he was on the show over a black with oh very or he did a good job is a great lawyer yeah it really is that he has a good way about him David either and I really liked him ... one of the the most fun oh shows we've had I\nDo know that he married one of the jurors in that case\nYes I Do and we didn't bring it out here a year [laughter] and I suppose\nYou know if if that's the way you got to win it that's the way to\nDo that [laughter] I don't think that was I got out of a dryland amateur yeah that's after the\nShow you what it is I get it here you are gone all through these trials you've tried more cases and moved trial lawyers in California and do you think these judges or any good\nOh I think judge as you know in general are just fine except for the ones that try to throw me out of the courtroom\n[laughter] I don't like them very well off as they try and thought she out now and then well I've had that experience\nWhere I've had to get a lawyer because a judge decide for God Knows what reason as to press should not be in there and I know First Amendment law which is very useful to know in my job and so I Will go to a judge\nSay you know you can't exclude me from the plume Eric hearing because there is the riverside press enterprise case that says I have to be in there\nAnd the and often I'm able to convince them a those are the only judges that I have to be a couple of\nTaking your down though no you've always got in your way as\nWell um no we've lost things early on and then we've gone to the appeals court and one um I think that in the Michael Jackson case we lost more battles than we've lost in any case and it was very sad because among other things to judge prevented us from\nGetting a copy of the indictment I mean the indictment is the basis of the whole case and to seal the indictment was unheard of and unfortunately because of the way things went down there we got almost all of the documents after the trial was over\nHe he may be releasing stuffed to this day it just kept releasing it after it was over and uh and it was useless at that point because the case was over ... been acquitted we didn't need it then\nBut we did need it beforehand and it's interesting because in the in what we were talking about in the OJ case in Vegas we just won a judgment there from the appeals court from the Supreme Court in favor of the press because um we were\nUh not given copies of jury questionnaires among other things and the jury questionnaires would have revealed\nThat the jurors had these strong feelings against OJ and we didn't know it and had we reveal that it might have made a difference in the case I think it's unfair when we don't get the the information because the public has a right to know that\nI'm just going to ask when does a crystal ball take on the Internet versus newspapers cause your name was on millions of times Associated Press all over the world in ten years people are predicting that will be any more than his papers the ... his name off of you you think we're just going all Internet\nI don't think so I don't think there will ever be a time when they were being known newspapers I think that the number is diminishing um people are willing to adapt to the Internet all those certain people are not I know an awful lot of people that say I have to have my daily newspaper in front of me with the coffee or it's not a good day\nAnd I'm afraid I'm In that category I have to read my paper on paper\nI have a hard time doing the crossword puzzle with my pin on my right very messy yeah so I think that there will always\nBe a print presence but I think that a lot of the newspapers are adapting and are offering their papers online and readers are adapting to they're they're starting to pay for it and that's where it it will come down to whether it becomes routine a and whether every won't be able to afford to\nKeep printing the news you know what I'm\nHere referred to as the queen of journalism oh well thank you well you know that and and that's been written about use for a long time\nYou have to feel pretty good don't you know here in this very competitive arena in this arena where the press is frequently referred to as massively unfair\nAnd here you stand out as the queen of journalism and even your comments today as we listen to you on\nDid you take a side here who is right who was wrong I think you were genuine and those responses I'm just going to report you know great\nWell I appreciate that guy is it a great it's humbling in many ways and um it's also you know I I also have to realize that I have a lot to live up to and uh and I hope that I'll be able to continue doing that\nOkay you're going to be back here in two years twenty four months what has happened during the past twenty four months\nBy then probably a lot of other people are gonna be in trouble and I'm going to be covering them\nHow 'bout that basically know pretty good stuff you've been listening to champions of justice with Tom draconian royal oaks are very special guests today Linda Deutsch Associated Press special correspondent our producer as a man to count on duty known a couple of thoughts we uh earlier referred to the Pulitzer Prize\nAnd it was Joseph Pulitzer who set our Republican to the press will rise or fall together\nThat coupled with the comment by Warren Buffett the smarter but journalists are the better off society is for to a degree\nPeople repressed to inform themselves and the better the

number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nLarry as we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we got the job market we've got that down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush biased that we already have is being consumers maybe maybe you could take that into a into a ... expand on that WIPP for our listeners and even ...\nAnything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit is the markets are coming down\nGreat question right on the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own they don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around to some education the problem is the very costly lesson why would you want to spend all that time energy and money\nWhen you can learn a system in what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shorting the markets and so I Want to use the analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said T well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go in drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize soda the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the market's going down and what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... coming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's ... who's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYou when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I always stress inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focus on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being as ... it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets and and and when I talk to people is very normally the did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate the income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income scale has to come first and it's that the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody as successful or not it's just like I I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane of across the country that's a that's a whole different conversation and\nWe would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we could be putting ourselves to\nAbsolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to ally spend more time with your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job maybe one of volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so\nA lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely we're coming up

director instructor development and top instructor it online trading the reins of the operation here that's for sure shouldn't some lights on how to make money to the markets are going up down her side was how to generate more\nMoney how to generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole a whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying in the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like\nWell starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and it's just something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this\nBank has only had what was it nine losing days and five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratched their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spent time at a job they get better and better at it before they know it they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhat I talk to students about the biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where are they going to be able to make up that income\nAnd you know it's not a question anymore if it's when we're already starting to see\nLive in ... I'm Joe Myers President Trump is denying reports it a secret deal with turkey for the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson\nOn Twitter this morning Trump said there was no deal for the past just released adding quote I don't make deals for hostages Brunson was imprisoned in Turkey on terrorism charges which he denied the fifty year old pastor landed on American soil today the president

[noise]\n\nYou're listening to how we're trading Radio Welcome back if you're just tuning in us Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and half instructor it on I mean really shed some light on income ... we talked a lot about multiple streams of income\nWe talked about different types of income passive income active in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active income and and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether\nIt's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow and I'm not income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment talking to a little bit about the retirement accounts and so one of the things that may be missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more a more generating more income well don't worry we're gonna be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot via social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook rave got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions\nWe have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics 'cause I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those such one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and to correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier in the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first thing we got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade and mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world the Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss is set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people and senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about and especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira or four one K. you are investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThat we ever see that index have been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work\nWhen you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nAnd the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time high as as being you buy low opera opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations there's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for uh\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nBathroom there are a speed through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now is the markets are collapsing or financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging will be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine or take\nThe average price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there he says okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have to classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down her sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your past this is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside her kid makes it so you just started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you could scores of passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with the retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside well\nMost importantly you need to understand where your risk reward relies so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight ... students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you\nSwitch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I haven't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nShe's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she recently gone through a divorce and what you decided to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe she moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough and had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year\nBut imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice to get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you could pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody want to help in the future\nYou know what I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life you know we're talking about about financial freedom that's that's\nReally what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and I was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually came up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it\nAnd he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty for your call here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times Larry where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I I was ... down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only works for like eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who's just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know we had die off Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for a price really come down to you it it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather told me that's when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away and that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price\nThat's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education and confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is uh\nHalf day class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and

where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nLet's consistency Ryan most people come in they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit ... beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now then you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact ... once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again in expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nYou know I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy de what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nAnd he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know that's the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that so that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got\nNow one of the ways that where we start this off one of the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time pass and let's get some people educated changed their lives

Drew in Lawrence upon with Jillian and John Kades babies Los Angeles county cumulus station\nIs job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stop and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have\nIt sells strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell in November of oh seven to stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June of old nine so we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself over time time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired are retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody shot or\nDon't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is a part of the show is among where we talked about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect which you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten till\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening talking about you I'm I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive pink thing that she does and it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a ... right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email to ...\nWe had the best I\nCan tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK anyway let's talk about is this is Alvin and ate all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October ish and all that\nAnd at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but there were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically\nAnd at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally uh fell off a cliff\nSo is this like that\nI'm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWill basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raise interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week is the beginning of a new bear market recession all that\nKind of stuff but you know what it does do in my view it should be a wake up call to you because did you know did you see how fast it fell I mean it was like what eleven hundred points and two days I mean that's fast\nThe market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly I mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did and why two K. or and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income for your from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and your contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your

I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families are in in forty three states\nOh\nAnd you know what it never ceases to offer and me and in and and actually it it gives me enthusiasm and makes me want to go to work every day and do my best because uh you know it's such a wonderful thing and Financial Times named uh our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and that's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning is our primary focus\nAnd so that's you we love to help you if we could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are probably the most important\nOf decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six or sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens if they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a why would you want to delay it why would you take when you're sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be ... eighty six currently I think is the uh is is it is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you'll walk up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nAnd we're here\nFor you in our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter]\nSo uh if you go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd uh you do you have two options when you're there one is you can sign up for one of our seminars\nAnd we have seminars near you and at

to reduce your income taxes when you retire we'll talk about how to maximize your cash flow okay so when you are retired it's in my opinion it's all about cash flow you got to make sure you have the cash coming in to cover the lifestyle that you want\nAnd you know we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nOkay that means you've got to go play and have fun and you got to have the money to pay for all that stuff so we want to help you to figure that out we also talked about your four one K. and when should you take Social Security sixty two sixty six

thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is a a just a an honor and privilege\nAnd we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so most of our focus is on a

we're\nA I think honored adjusted to be in the running to win it which is a a good thing because you know in our business I think ethics in in all businesses but particularly in our business I think ethics are very very important [noise]\nAnyway um we're going to talk now about the foundational philosophy that we have when we manage our clients money is because we are financial advisors as I mentioned\nWe have all kinds of stuff on there that I think you can benefit from um this is a part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy\nAnd washed undeserving airs the fruits of your\nLabor and we do this because money isn't everything but it sure keep the kids in touch does it not that she had a real sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts\nLadies and gentleman you don't want to see unhappy squirts that's not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirt anyway this is a time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it Jack and you play it I Know I\n\nWould always say you\nKnow my ... may be and\n\nAnd\nOf course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes in probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite and we don't want that to happen to you so therefore\nEvery week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and state taxes during that entire time so wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIsn't it its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create a junior lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will soap on your dad they read the will and it says create the trust so it can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it will be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and estate taxes why well because for example let's say that uh you know your your daughter gets a divorce\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the ... the inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child or not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the in the dynasty dress or the it's called the generation skipping tax stress because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money as trustees your children or whoever you named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support him H. E. N. S.\nAnd you know hams is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind to they're greedy and watched undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest if they are real estate or something like that\nSo talk to your uh financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\nWell\nDorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to on a bus or financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you know what do to our website at his money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it

with work and with making sure this new affiliate is happy and are dealing with sponsors and dealing with listeners than dealing with the issues\nAnd making sure that I'm saying but at the end of the day when you're sick of this stuff that matters is uh your wife and your kids\nYou know and ...\nAnd and your grandkids and it was a ... and by the way to something else that I've spoken about on the air on my show several times is\nThat that's one of the the great advantages of of the Sabbath and why why it is which I think it's something that a lot of people who look at the ten commandments the one that doesn't really seem to fit is commandment number for at least the way that both Jews and Protestants enumerate them\nThe Fourth Amendment is on the Sabbath and keep it wholly why should that be one of the ten\nBasic rules that God gives human beings and the answer is because the Sabbath is there to give us perspective to have one day where you emphasize the\nDifference between what's urgent which tends to dominate our lives right and what is truly important and what is truly important is not necessarily taking advantage of that\nIll at Costco or earning ... a little bit more for yourself forgetting that new car that you're talking about but the the stuff that uh you can't really put a monetary value on which is family friends fellowship a deepening your experiences being a a living human being\nAnd having that day to be able to reflect and focus on real priorities as you're talking about\nReally means a lot to a lot of people and and it's too bad that people don't realize that they have to stop once in a while to really appreciate what's important now I Want to just take a second because you asked a question about whether we experienced cancer and of course\nIt was throat cancer that you had in two thousand fourteen and you're off the air for a little while and then thankfully you came back\nDoing well right yeah thank God\nYeah thank God so I was diagnosed in two thousand twelve or with cancer I had a tumor on my kidney um I was very weak and I couldn't have the surgery they had to take my kidney out I sat in the hospital for three weeks waiting to try and get to levels where they could do the surgery\nI'm at that time the day before I was supposed to have the surgery when I was finally strong enough\nUm I got a call from the doctor they said they looked at a scan and they saw that the cancer it's spreading it was all over my body I was riddled with cancer and the next day they were going to take my kidney out\nUm what happened was I woke up in the morning and you talk about perspective Michael you talk about you know what you go through in your thoughts and\nYou know I Try to keep my wits about me it wasn't easy I actually on the ten minutes before I was taken to surgery I got on one knee I got off the gurney and I proposed to my fiance my wife she said yes of course because who's going to say no when a guy than going into surgery\nAnd uh she said yes I gave her the ring that my office manager had brought me because I could I was in the hospital\nWent into surgery they were putting me out the anesthesiologist who's about to put me out to the doctor ran in he was running late the surgeon said stop stop don't put that man out\nAnd the guy said why why he said well we just had another radiologist review this we don't think it's cancer we think it's it's just a human told me there's blood that we've seen and it it's not a cancerous tumor do not do surgery the everyone started sharing the nurses and the doctors were hugging each other they sent me back to the room I went back\nSo I my fiance and my mother who were sitting there and said let's go home to ripped out all of the IVs and went home that day miracles do happen in ...\nThat is that's one of the happiest cancer stories that I've heard\nHad a and M. and so you still have your kidney\nI'd still have I have everything I have a little bit of a human toll little blood there but I'm I'm healthy and I'm thankful but you know I did feel guilty about the fact that so many other people don't get that kind of news I mean it's very much\nWeird in America but I did experience the feelings for approximately three or four weeks after the diagnosis of what it was going to be like if it was a real diagnosis terrifying in their heads\nIt say it again it it can be very terrifying but one of my favorite quotes is a there's a great British novelist EM forester that's not the CS Forester who did the Horatio horn blower books it's ... am forester Howard's and passage to India and\nHe wrote in a book called the angels fear to tread a desk and destroy a man but knowledge of death can save him and I think that's a that's an important important

we're talking to Michael ... [noise]\nI think Roger ... once said that Michael medicated has for a long time been a political commentator not a movie critic would you agree with that Michael\nYeah sure I mean but I did not a movie critic implies that ah there is no political point of view and movie criticism and this is one of those things I had several public debates with Roger\nSome in front of a may rest in peace some in front of a very big crowds and and Roger is deeply political his his wife his widow now or was ... I at one time the share of the cook county Illinois Democratic Party\nAnd particularly during the year two thousand if you followed\nRogers commentary I mean almost everything was it an attack on President Bush and uh the idea that somehow your political point of view your cultural point of view your ah\nYour basic world view your world view is somehow divorced from the way you respond to popular culture it seems to me is ridiculous and by the way it it comes up not just in movies that are overtly political but particularly in those for instance I was struck by the fact\nMichael Moore's new movie which obviously is very political and I try to give Michael Moore a fair review\nA because when reviewing movies that I've been reviewing movies and starting on CNN or let me see that would be a thirty eight years ago\nWhile time I go in any of that the\nThat the economy well we had a kind\nOf rough how you get a rumble yeah\nBut but I'm Glad the economy has been percolating along all of that is positive I'm Glad that we took down ISIS there are real achievements here and I think the president is doing much better than many people expected now however the the idea of the character is ever irrelevant in a president of the United states\nIt's hypocritical to take that position for anyone who knows our history it all\nMy favorite my favorite book about the presidency and it's really one of those classic books that every American should read is called the presidential character\nAnd it's by a former professor of mine named James David barber and professor barber rights and makes this point which is on the sale of all which is that no president no not Donald Trump not Ronald Reagan no president just simply keeps all of his campaign promises\nYou may remember President Bush didn't run for president to fight a war on terror it's events happen right\nIs that what really defines are great presidents of versus are good presidents versus our average\nPresidents versus presidents who don't like I said well is not their campaign promises what defines their success is how they respond to crisis how they respond to events\nAnd uh and and that's certainly true for the people who the president's who generally by general common consensus are considered the greatest\nWhich would be of course Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and then most people would throw in both Roosevelt yeah\nUm okay so the point over here is President Trump I worry about that because a ... and and again there from time to time there's ways of being reassured\nBut one of the things that the president does is he sets the tone for the country and a a tone of divisiveness and polarization and trying not just to defeat the other guys but to destroy the other guys\nThat's what we as conservative hated during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings and we shouldn't be committed to did dealing out the same for the other\nSide that makes sense we have to take a break as you know in radio we can't just keep talking we wish we could just before we take the break really quickly did you confront or did Dennis confront you after that about this character issue with President
