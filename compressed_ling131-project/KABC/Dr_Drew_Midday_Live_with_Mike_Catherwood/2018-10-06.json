{"content": "That's absolutely right both lawyer volunteers and we're writing checks to support our work\nAnd the lawyer volunteers and you know these homeless people or various legal problems and so forth that they try to assist with\nThat right so it's all housing and homelessness focus your firms you will know Tom helped us with a slum housing case last year\nWe represent a lot of tenants who are struggling with their landlords around slum housing conditions\nBut we also help homeless veterans apply for benefits we help families are facing eviction to stay in their homes or to have a soft landing someplace else if they're going to have to leave and all of those things are greatly benefitted by having lawyers help people navigate those processes how many lawyers are healthy we have twenty two attorneys on staff\nAnd we have a last year um over thirty thousand hours of volunteer pro bono attorney time valued at over fourteen million dollars and volunteer lawyer time on top of our staff to us\nAnd then if a for lawyers out there that says gee I'd like to maybe help out a little bit on something like this I don't want to be full time I Want to give a little bit how do they go about that\nSo they should call her office a and look up online and send us an email and we would be happy to talk to them about our specific needs in specific programs at the moment some of the areas we provide training uh depending on you know what their background is and and what their help with an other areas depending on the background we just plug people in and have them go with\nAnd how about somebody who isn't a lawyer but we'd like to help out what would they do\nSo for supporting inner city Law Center where they could do is write a check to support our staff work um but I think it's an important point to make that\n... the hopefulness that exist right now around homelessness in the midst of all this horror\nIs that many more people are carrying about this issue they're focusing on this issue they're volunteering with various organizations that work on these issues and more people are insisting that our elected officials address these issues so the reason why we're seeing leadership\n... the city and county level is in large part because as Greg said we know what the solutions are and the public is insisting that our elected officials act\nAnd so even just calling your local city council man or woman or your local board of supervisors representative and saying\nYou know what are you doing to help address homelessness keeping that pressure on and that attention on this issue\nIs something that anyone can do and for non lawyers or we don't have a lot of volunteer opportunities in inner city Law Center there were great organizations are in town I'll just mention a couple of people interested that they can Google One is a group called ah oh PCC LAMP Community\nDoes great work that people can look up there's homeless health care which is on Skid Row\nThere's path adventures um there's a lot of different organizations in South LA there's a group called topics lots of wonderful organizations doing great work day in and day out I'm wary if you're a non lawyers can volunteer as well\nBut what is your Web address for people who are local and want to get involved or people\nListening listening nationally and saying I Want to see some of their solutions what is your Web address\nIts inner city law dot or I N N E R C I F she why L.

financing which was of course we're in bank comes in and creative financing is always a great way to help a buyer getting a new home a lot of people feel\nThat there's a barrier okay and the barrier needs to be broken down okay and I think that there's a fear factor as well\nThat's one of the main factor is is fear but also the unknown people have to get an education you know if you don't know you don't know but if you do know you do know you need to find out what you need\nYou to know from an expert and that's what it's coming from M. bank but I Want to come to the phones right away we want to go to Jason right now Jason how are you\nGood that you're having me on the show guys\nUh go ahead do\nOkay sure here's a question I had I I I own a condominium that I currently rent out and uh and you know it it makes it up it covers and I've built up some equity in it because I've had it for about ten years and here's my question for you guys are what I'm struggling with [noise]\nAh I'm considering selling it outright uh but not sure if that's the way I should go or if I should just do like a refinance and take some you know take some money out of it that way what do you have a recommendation\nIcy for smiles on the panel right now Steve you want to start\nA yeah of course so if you speak for the realtor the realtors going to tell you the seller right there ... they look so uh\nSo so is this time to sell it right there relative to the polls you sell it and Germany lifting\nUm but I have an option that will actually help the realtor and help you okay I don't recommend\nSelling obviously if you're if you can afford to hold on to any piece of real estate I always recommend that you hold on to the real estate um this this state of the um lending world today is such that you may be able to pull some\nCash route hold onto that property um rent the property out take the cash and go through the realtor and purchased another house so this way the realtors we'd be happy on this panel and you're going to be happy and both of wealth\nThrown in and you're in the wake of at\n... yeah Jason the up and this is Tony by the way the other thing that you can consider doing is like Steve mentioned uh we have a program that can ... ... if you can get the property to cash flow in other words the the the rent is a a hundred and ten percent of the mortgage payment then they're able to do it\nNow Tony you're talking about if he wants to buy another investment property and make more income\nNo I'm Talking about if he wants to take cash out of his current condo he don't pay cash out of this current condo use that like like Steve said to to buy the property but we have a specific program that if we can help them cash flow on that or will he can qualify\nFor that as well so he could keep his existing property without his rental use the money he's taking out buying another property so we'd have to properties to rental income so much more tax benefits for oh one would be a rental and one would be as primary residence midway now Jason ... currently own a primary residence\n[noise] I Do this is a I I I used to live in a condo and then I

I'm just getting go ahead that\nWould be better to sell some investment property now that the prices are so high or is there a way to get like equity out of that investment property would that be a wise decision knowledge how would you say going about that which would be the better to\nWell I'm going to turn you over to Scott Goldman who's an expert realtor but I think you're going to get a slanted point of view but I about Scott synonymous guy\nSo we want to read but with Scott's a panel will have to\nRun but what I say I'm Lionel how long have you been in the home or how long have you on the investment property I should ask\nUh twelve years\nTwelve years and at this point you over less on it than it's worth or you owe more on it's\nBeen a word yeah no I was much less\nSo in this market right now depending on where the property sets and its viability sometimes it's a really great idea to sell now is the time to maximize your profitability however there are times if you have a low basis as we talked about at the beginning of the show\nThat could be a rental property for you and if you have a low basis you have a low property tax and your profitability is higher\nAs far as equity in the home is concerned there's always a way to catch some money out take a trip pay for college all at the money guys jumping on that by another property by another property hearts is another property there you go so some guys think by another property some guys think take a trip\nOf course on the real estate side we always say by our property you only make money when you buy real estate\nLight on how many properties or your own\nTwo okay well now too and that's the problem\nAfghan yet so you have a primary right out of this idea to investment properties so Steve\nWant to take the second part because you can be five parts of this question [laughter] ensuring\nI'm much like I said and I stayed at uh to the other person that has the property I you know right now you have the financing\nAvailable to be able to uh take the equity out without having to deal with selling the property like Scott side with on a lower basis and then having to pay 'em capital gains tax on it right so when whenever you have the chance to do that\nAre in my opinion you always do that right so you take the money out any way I mean in your ... in in your habit free of any capital gains\nUm but a couple of questions what type of properties are these\nSingle family homes\nAnd um critically how much are they worth\nWhile they're in Burbank that's tricky I've had friends that had sold their property and they put it up for one price and then they wind up in a bidding war right now and people are paying you know it\nJust the average will give me your best guess a million ... H ... million age and how much do you do in these one about four hundred thousand age don't so um so you have four hundred thousand age to what I Would do is I Would refinance um and then I Would buy more properties that's what I Would do okay I have\nBeen censored consensus seems to be take the actually out of the two pieces of property and and I ... a third of property right now even though the prices are high on\nAll the prices just like Scott said the thing is now it's becoming a buyer's market so I mean we reviewed being able to take that money out and having the requisite cash in hand sharing that you're kind of going to be able to make some demands that other people that have to go from\nNow is the time the market has the market has come back about a three little over three point four percent so there's a lot of build an ... out there and you're in a better position\nThan if you're looking for a long term and long term plan from an investment perspective real estate there's really no bad time to buy for your book you've got to turn up to them well Burbank is a great part of\nThe city's Sherman Oaks and seen oh a studio city all great places to make a purchase\nAnd a good thing is um we or experts at the higher and investment property lending um so what ...\nWhat about by property out of state I have some uh friends that are doing quite a bit of buying in Iowa\nOkay so I don't I don't know much about your corn farmer I don't know if that were done on Iowa Iowa was Idaho Iowa those are those are all great places um Utah I think right now hearts Nevada Utah Tennessee Alabama you know there are those\nPrices or ... or ... I Would say Houston ties with the S. and we come right on the ... is a very hot market uh right now so\nYou get a lot more new your dollars you need to look at where industry is going to I mentioned sparks Nevada because FedEx just put a huge facility there Tesla but a huge facility Amazon's going in there so you have to look at where\nAmazon going everywhere right well there's a lot of different ways of Jersey say they're going to Newark everyone Alabama's saying the move with Alabama\nWell into what looks good to have ... I Know Scott I'd ... I'd sticks angle would light on what I really think\nYou should do is we're going to take the time and and go over your situation and we'll we'll probably give you a call after the show but if you want to talk to him alone expert and find out what your\nOptions are call eight hundred nine eight zero when two to three and they will give you an education and find out what's available to you that's eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three and would you do that for us\nI have a third point at sun yet [noise] um what I think you should do is\nGet what they call a market analysis which will tell you what the average rents are in the area\nSo you can look at how much of a return I Am I going to get every month after my property taxes home insurance and small upkeep fee that you always set aside or find out what you could sell the house for\nTake that money and possibly by multiple properties which will give you better tax benefits more tax write offs\nAnd we'll give you three other or to other sources of residual income and you might be able to build your wealth through real estate and once those get more equity you use that equity and get more\nIt's like we said in the beginning of the show whether you're buying your first house you're Seventeen shopping center we want to educate your what your options are [noise]\nAnd that's because that's actually my thinking like if I should get in the house to make it into equity and I think that's what I Would like it or that lady I spoke about\nSteve you have some programs that you could utilize that she couldn't get from the big box banks why don't we talk about that real quick\nA high so and so I I'm to answer your question and like we've said it to the other callers before uh my position is always to be a a little bit more aggressive cash out and purchase more homes because that's the way that you're going to build well\nUm and ... do you know\nWith home prices in Southern California going off on a regular basis although they've staggered today was historic in Southern California is one of the hottest markets\nIn the country if not the world that's right so old vote to day these prices may be staggering may be be pulling out maybe pledged going\nBut within the next you have to think about what's going to happen five years from now what's going to happen ten years from now and what's going to happen is you're going to look back and say oh man you know what\nA property I could have bought for a million dollars now is going for two million dollars I'm sure there's a lot of people out there today who thought about that ten years ago right\nWell I mean I I've seen the news for you ten years from now you're going to say the same thing about today I'm so right now you have the opportunity I ... and this is a good time to buy because Scott said right now there's more inventory and it's a buyer's market right\nYou're you're sitting in the driver's seat in multiple ways using cash out of the house and and what's going to happen is you're going to be able to buy those homes as an all cash buyer and you're going to be able to make deals that other people that need financing won't be able to do\nAnd you know Sonia one of the things that is a specialty of MBA you don't have to use your W. twos you don't have to use your pay stubs you don't have to use your tax returns\nThey have so many programs that are available for you that you don't have to use that income they can take income off the proposed new Iran's they'll allow you to take cash out based upon other formulas that you can\nIt's get anywhere else\nTony no the other thing I was thinking I have a friend actually has two homes in Anaheim and he\nActually rents them through air being be because of the demand for for Disneyland because if you so that's another thing that you can think about even if you got cash out and you were able to let a cash flow it could be a good a ... kind of property for you to so just one of the throw that out to you know and yet\nIf he'll call the office at eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three you're going to get a free education\nAnd what they're going to do was outlined several different options for you because we all need to know what we need to know\nAnd since you have a free and clear house maybe you want to leverage it because of the rents that you will get from that house will cover your mortgage payment and then you can use some of that cash to buy other properties and the rents from those other ... properties was pay all your expenses and spin off some profit\nAnd then you're going to start becoming a real estate mogul\nAnd then maybe you want to move to Manhattan beach tour and so there's many different opportunities it's just a matter which one is the best and makes the most and see it\nSeems like she's going to Manhattan New York here [laughter]\nAnd the great thing about it is and ... will be your lender of choice

time the only time you could possibly lose money in a down market if you decide to sell but if you don't have to sell you're never going to lose money never saw the real estate Scott\n... what do you think is the the primary ... you you obviously screen buyers and sellers all the time but what what's the most common um I think why don't we see mistake but the the common misconception that it that somebody has when they're trying to buy a house\nI think that the buyer tends to get in a little bit over their head there's always the idea of biting off more than you can chew and chewing it anyways but as we've talked about pretty qualifying is hugely important you've got to know what your sweet spot is you've got to know what you're looking for you've got to know what you can afford and what you can't\nWrite because everybody has a misconception of of how much they make in in what their credit reside in till they actually run their credit until somebody actually analyze their ... their income\nExactly they come to somebody like you you provide them a letter you guys are good to two million dollars and that gives them a comfort zone and the sellers comfort when they receive an offer that's your good and you're not wasting anybody's\nTalk you know actually em bank makes alone is highest ten million ... that you know so if you're looking for a luxury financing or whether it's F. ha VA conventional financing their national mortgage lender located right here in Southern California\nThey use common sense when it comes to approving you're alone I Would give them a call eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three that's eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three eight hundred die need zero one two to three you know we want to thank you for listening to the house cause radio show and it's you\nKnow every Saturday we're here for you\nThank you for listening have a great weekend thank you again very thick ... thinks they're experts\nThat ... will continue to take your calls after the program called out to find out about these new loan programs you can start your home loan process and eight hundred Ninety zero one two to three feet show furnished by chance they mortgaged to California and unless I have three two three two [noise]\nAre listening six nine doing three years the national key word and [laughter] and I find one night while you weren't shot [laughter] dollars [laughter]\nYou know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing\nAnd that's like the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go over with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know we did all that we've done\nOr that are listening audience could possibly want from a financial show doing very on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip\nOkay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very ah what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and just puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this is this is when you look at her she'd like a big dog you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd uh so the the update because people apparently are interested in this I don't know why is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this submission P. thing it's awful\nIt's like the first time she sees me she squats and ... a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know and I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside and opening the door so she comes out to me but then she peas right on the patio and golly\nI don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but I Hope so [laughter]\nAnyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week or looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that the unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely it's going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bond even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market we're falls and crashes it's like this this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing\nSo as you know a couple of months ago we\nReduced the duration of our bond portfolio we actually uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up\nAnd there because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we want we want to make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not review drawn portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd there's a link on there that says meet with an advisor\nAnd if you click on that then you know we'll sit

so thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families and forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of

your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stopped\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collected and\nIt's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kinds of things there actually eight thousand\nCombinations of that the answer to that question\nHow how and when I take my Social Security\nAnd what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter] okay so how do you figure that at all well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our farm we put we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy\nAnd start claim Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually\nStart when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six to start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait\nFor every year that you wait the benefit that you are going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy it increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive\nThere to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what are we believed to be the reasons why you may want to weigh two you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to is that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it as sixty six and just give it to me [laughter]\nIf you don't want it I'll take it [laughter] but uh anyway yeah so if you if you feel that uh you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period than we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan\nWe want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you

E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that yourself needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed\nTo a a Toyota lifestyle they can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taking care of while they're alive but upon their death do you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the Q tip trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called de Q tip trust qualified tour mental interest property but shoot tips easier to say\nAny way hum if you'd like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your escape planting about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website it is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit now when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon like I said that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire financial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions\nWe want to help you with a retirement planning decisions or income tax decisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who is retired are retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions\nAnd if we can help you that's fantastic well do it at no charge obligation\nAnd if we cannot help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part friends\nWell Dorothy it is not too wonderful to be true because it is true\nSo do that okay now if you don't want to go directly to an advisor then what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net at the same or we're going to talk about uh several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions are going to talk about how to protect yourself from the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above\nWell you know what Jack I cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\nInformation presented should not be regarded as\nA complete analysis on the subject to discuss and should not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned none of this show's content viewed as personalized investment by a professional advisor should be consulted been more implementing many of the strategies presented\nNumerous times I've been messing is involved with varying degrees of ribs and therefore getting no insurance at any specific inventive or strategy will be suitable profitable for my portfolio tax\nPlanning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nNational regarding yours the legal taxing ... founded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of him or a war and then W.

orange\nMueller station circles just spent [noise]\nRight absolutely\nI'm so glad and this is this is my dad wasn't around to see the ... knock on my dad's gone but my dad loves Bill Cosby we watched The Cosby show together he loved and my dad more sweaters like Bill Cosby\nAnd he said and rattled serious I had my daughter will cause he flared anywhere college sweatshirts there were no he weren't you know causing more than like the the different colored sway off the net since ... just like my dad and I remember\nDid he do it on America's top forty Morgantown exactly up ten in the winter but Bill Cosby\nAnd my dad they dress the same my dad just love ... and I think it would have broken his heart to know what Bill Cosby is and what he did and the heinous crime he committed I Do I think I would've broken it's hard\nTo tell you the only thing for me that my question is the me too movement and I think there is that it needed to be here and it's a great movement but I'm also concerned that there are guys that are doing what Bill Cosby did they're they're just being accused and their lives are being ruined\nWhat do you have to say about that and have you come across that\nYou know the I think it's really important to point out that me too movement\nIs about giving people a voice last giving people a voice right giving them a forum so that when\nA talk about an experience that they had they aren't automatically\nYes credited because of what they do or how long it took them to report it or the decisions that they made eagle or ask is that with the me too movement about is about that's why I guess I'm kind of disagree that\nThat you have that because of the meat you local business people being you know because of the me too movement more awareness has been um raise about sexual violence and more people feel comfortable coming forward\nBut I think people now because of the me too movement now because of how seriously taken which should be taken seriously and people should come forward and they should feel comfortable coming forward but now you accuse somebody and because it's such a you know an accusation is being now taken very seriously\nTheir lives get ruined until that there are ... you to somebody and it's you might as well just say that they did it that's I mean there are people now\nFighting for their careers and their lives because they were accused\nWave that see that's the thing is when you have someone who's accused they should be investigated grant\nYou know it didn't have to step in and we we need a I I like that I mean I I Would like to have you know we we had an attorney Keith ... who\nWas the debating champion with Lisa Bloom by the way up to Twenty years ago but um you know she defended a people and he represents people men uh primarily who may have been wrongly accused\nAnd I think the issue here and and you'll Chris I Want you to jump in because I I Know what you're saying is very important\nBut as an attorney I think really what we need to focus on and this is what you said is the evidence the investigations and not look at it\nAs someone's life being ruined her someone's life not being ruined life isn't fair some people get accused unfairly it's the minority typically they're Seventy percent of a sexual assaults that are not report it because of fears\nOf the repercussions so we understand that there are percentages of either people who are wrongly accused\nA lotta percentages of women who are abused that never have\nThe opportunity to get the justice that Andrea Constand in and maybe ... some of the other sixty plus accusers get from this trial but don't you think Christian that we really need to look at evidence in each case including\nThe Brett Kavanaugh case\nSo I guess why am having such trouble answering the question is there's a court of law there's a quarter public opinion right and so I think\nBottom line is with me too movement it's raising awareness it makes sexual violence survivors and people who ... who had X ... such humiliating experiences\nHurt for him to be without being discredited in any manner that doesn't mean that they don't that\nThat what that means is okay we're going to look at your claim and not just credit just cause of X Y Z ... anything unrelated to the social ... violent now like you were saying there are people who come on and say oh well now just a little mad asleep much do\nWe know that women aren't just automatically believed\nYou see that in the back you know hearing right chair\nI I Would have to a hundred percent disagree that because it'll be two movement you have people each each\nThat is not what the me too movement of it is about now are there some ... who has one vision based on land allegations that are set forth perhaps but that's because of the me too movement the me too movement\nIn my opinion is solely about not just editing that person because of the most common misconceptions that surround rape and sexual violence and sexual harassment the me too movement is about ...\nMaking the public yeah that just because we be wearing and doesn't immediately or their humiliating and embarrassment ... what happened to them\nIt doesn't mean that they should be credited just because someone or something that was provocative it doesn't mean that they should be discredited just because that person that multiple sexual ... doesn't mean that they should be discredited\nYou know what I mean right because the subsequent contact with the offender doesn't mean that they should eat is credited looked at what should happen is that day\nJust like the accuser should have a forum by people look at the allegations and look at the offenders you know a sense is why you could apply the way they are and not assassinate a person's character that they they came forward\nAnd you know we and I make myself like a little bit clear I didn't want you to think of a hard thing away from it\nSo it's very clear and in fact you've talked about victims shaming and blaming in this particular case\nOr that you felt bad about when a defense attorney um someone perhaps representing Bill Cosby is going after the accuser\nAnd the question becomes should that be evidence that a jury a that a judge should here just as you as a prosecutor have the opportunity at least in this case you had the opportunity to bring five other witnesses in to talk about a pattern of bad behavior\nSo you know it goes both ways\nI think that what you're saying is that just because someone makes the accusation they shouldn't be subject to shaming\nAnd blaming right but don't you think you have to have some credibility for that accuser\nWe mean by that don't you think you have to have some credit\nWell if the accuser for instance Dr Ford has no credibility\nHow is how how does that reflect on what happened when someone doesn't wasn't there when if the if we weren't there we don't know and you're dealing with as you've prosecuted a number of cases aren't you looking at what kind of evidence there is in this case and you were able to show that there was a lot of evidence\nAnd that ... concept was credible so when you look at rectum shaming you know maybe that's not the way to go for a defense when you have a credible accuser\nWell I guess what I guess the question though is that what type of evidence they're looking for right and this goes in a prosecution or in any type of four I'm right\nOn your book for corroborated evidence and the reason was most of these crimes are done in private so you do want to make sure it before ... some of them with something as a as negative as a sexually violent or a son didn't want to make sure that you have\nNo corroborating evidence right or that for sure you know before before you you ... someone in that manner but\nJust to be clear is way a person wearing it that is is is that its credit or even ... ... ... offense I Would say absolutely not whether or not she was a process whether or not she was my something provocative does not immunize her\nFrom being sexually assaulted a ... point lead someone\nYou know whereas those were trait that wouldn't normally completely credit a person I mean you have people saying publicly well if they could not have happened because she waited so long right how was that ever something that would\nImmunize someone from sexual violence\nAbsolutely you know you bring up an interesting point about statute of limitations and just because the statute may run doesn't mean that didn't happen and there are consequences but in Pennsylvania specifically in the bill Cosby case\nThe twelve year statute of limitations was at least there to allow for this to take place want to talk a little bit more about that Christian we got to take a quick break and you're listening degrees are right here on TALK radio seven Ninety KBC [noise]\nWent on and I know you know I'm not talking to turn a client privilege and I assume she's not a client but how were you able to get her to do what she apparently wanted to do any way\nYou know [laughter]\nI just and I again I don't mean to sound cheesy or anything like that but Andrea Constand I think\nThe reason that she was willing to cooperate was because you know I laid it out and explain her what the process would install\nAnd I think she was we were able to build a report and she trusted me to know that look I'm ... I'm going to be honest with you as to what we can\nDo what we can't do and what's going to happen\nAnd I think it was also um you know and I didn't go alone I have um three to act is one of which would add Shockley are investigating the crime waffle thousands by which this was a political while they had built that before we were also um\nYou know we were assisted in many ways on to help kind of build that recourse that she was able to trust us to kind of guide her through the process and again when I initially went up there were\nNecessarily the case but before we began our initial stages investigation we wanted to make sure that we charge that came on board um and looking for one of the things that really in about ... ... is she was willing to do it because she really strongly felt that it was supposed to be and\nI ... was such a tremendous only here for like survivor\nYou know it's interesting when you talk about that people don't understand that one of the greatest assets a lawyer can have is to be a psychologist\nAnd sometimes you have to be able to talk to people in a way where they do trust you and they are willing to come forward and obviously that's something that you have because you were successful in this way what is it in your past that has allowed you to have this kind of\nA empathy and sympathy and the ability to get someone to do something that they may be a little apprehensive about\nYou know I guess it's\nProbably really boils down to my upbringing hum of raising the church and one of the things that you know as a young girl growing up my mom and dad really taught me treat people the way they want to be treated and you know I always felt like I don't want it\nTo truth good bad or ugly and I wanted it to be conveyed and communicated respectful manner\nYeah that may not always get that but I you owe it to people to treat them and not matter particularly as a public servant\nYou know I worked for them and even though Andrea Constand looking at different ... was it difficult you know a Canadian citizen she was not even you know\nAn American citizen and certainly not talking about oh I'm a ... to her as a survivor and back then in this case but also to Montgomery County has a whole to make sure that the ... state yeah\nYeah I think that's really important and that's probably you know your background that's probably what really provides you with the ability to do what you did at least in this case and others as well we have to take a quick break were tied to Christian given fed and she's with stride Lee Ronan uh there's one of the prosecutors in the bill Cosby case\nAnd you are listening to ... right here on TALK radio seven Ninety KBC we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise]\nRadio southern maybe have have you seen these updates on the\nFront Kevin novelty the newest associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court he was narrowly confirmed by the Senate today fifty\nTo forty protesters tried to interrupt the Senate voted were removed from the visitors gallery by Capitol police meanwhile President Trump is heading to a rally in Topeka, Kansas tonight you left Washington just ahead of today's confirmation book\nThe FBI is revoking six cancer causing additives saying the companies that use them all at twenty four months to identify suitable replacement some food products\nThe up the action was in response to a twenty sixteen petitioning lawsuit by environmental groups and food safety experts the additives have been commonly used in candy ice cream chewing gum baking goods drinks and other foods since Nineteen sixty four\nK.
