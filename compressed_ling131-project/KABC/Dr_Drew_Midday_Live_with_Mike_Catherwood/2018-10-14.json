{"content": "She's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she'd recently gone through a divorce and which is added to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe with the center of the currency universe she moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough and had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year\nBut imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you can pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nYou know what I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life you know we talk a lot about financial freedom that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and I was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody\nActually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime when I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times where he where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I I was ... down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nEven my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for like eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over ... and so it was it was hilarious but where we are from a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know he had die off Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the poll of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for priced really come down to you it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather communist when I was like five years old\nI remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this the ... shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I Am for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from buildings skill a great place to start that is at the half the class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay alright\nRight now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of past is one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is

with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nLet's consistency Ryan most people come in they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit ... coach herbal beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now than you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I have heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact on Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expect to a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nYeah and I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is and I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nAnd he brought up the the the the inverse sight of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got\nNow one of the ways that where we start this off one of the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time passed and

the Saudis to cooperate\nThere's Hawaiian or red clay salt which I think it's silky there's black salt which tends to be rather um a sulfur\nIn its aroma um or sulfur focused I should say and very earthy and then smoke salt which is my favorite on and it's slow smoke usually over older would and I think it's fabulous and so do have assault tasting but consider taking it a step further\nBecause all of this salt conversation leads me to thinking about brining and turkey days just around the corner and I am big on brining so we might as well start planning for the ultimate Thanksgiving right\nBrining improves tenderness and flavor and an overnight soak in O'Brien or what is a salt water solution gives poultry and pork specifically sometimes\nAnd a chance to absorb not only seasoning but moisture now I always recommend you Brian your chickens and turkeys in your pork no matter what method of cooking you plan to use if it's roasting or grilling or ... or deep frying\nAnd the basic solution for Brian as a quarter cup of kosher salt to four cups of water\nNow I add aeronautics like brown sugar pepper corns bally's fresh time sometimes in the last is sometimes a scraped vanilla bean which is great for poor but you should on your favorite seasonings on apple cider can be substituted for half the water\nOr you can add honey Tabasco chilies citrus the list goes on\nAnd very simply on you just need to know or consider the size of the poultry that your using or the ... of pork\nAnd then consider how long the brine should remain on the protein now you can do it in a great big pot preferably a non reactive wander if you're doing an oversized turkey a big\nHeavy plastic bag works um but if you're just doing a couple of pieces or a whole chicken or you can get away with a couple of hours of brining\nA and a like a whole turkey twenty four hours is my focus for pork tenderloin or great big chops I look for about four hours in general\nNow there is this concept of dry brining is well it was a and\nI just I guess some years back\nThen you could do assault cure without the water itself to add moisture and flavor and it does work quite well um but I still go to the liquid version and\nI Do have dry Brian's and wet Brian's posted on my Web site at chef Jamie dot com so I Hope you'll check them out I also have a salt\nTutorial on and gladly will share all of this

I think I think it adds\nAn element of choices you make dishes\n... texture Lee and great I Love decaying so I can only imagine baking with Kiefer ... ad that additional level of flavor that compound added intensity you make a an adult you by the way in that that\nHey you know you get that little buttermilk labor from ... though he says you're really really good to\nOK author of offered goddess dress\nSquash and pumpkin soup\nOh yes and um before I let you go just go back to health benefits were using key for because of its extraordinary good bacteria\nAnd go down has been proven to benefit you talked about gastrointestinal\nDisorders um sinus infections in his ... have been proven to improve lactose digestion it's the perfect balance or ratio of cards and protein and nutrients it's a powerhouse food\nIt really is and again I mean it stood the test of time for two thousand years um so what we're learning about key for right now so even people who are lactose intolerant can still drink tea fair because\nOf the bacteria that probably addict bacteria uses the lactose in the milk at their food so it's pre digesting the lactose for you\nThough it's totally fine who can feel even if you have some lactose here and you're still getting their calcium and your protein and all your I'm healthy fats from the product and there is actually super super important especially\nFor women is a bone building years which starts really early as when you're a kid all the way through your senior\nBut um you know I I\nDefinitely nervous about this trend of eliminating all groups know very lucky to have a medical reason to do it you should not be eliminating an entire food group from your diet actually\nIt can cause dangerous side effects dangerous implications than I Do really feel that we are I'm kind of contributed to a generation of women weren't going to have academic levels of osteoporosis\nOr you can't get the calcium\nFrom a pill or from you know eating kale spinach all day\nOf the calcium to absorb into the about the vitamin D it needs the protein it needs that that\nUh so all of those things are super important so keepers like the perfect way to get it all if you're actresses how ...\nYou don't have to take it out of your diet and if you\nAre eliminating a group of food group is should be out under the supervision of a doctor who can tell you you know the ways the risks and benefits from doing so um but you know like we talked about earlier a little bit of moderation is really important that good for all of us\nUm but yeah so the researchers so fascinating about the micro biome it's this fray intersection between science and medical researcher at just diet food or that we're learning all this this important um use the information about the\nNeed for diversified got bacteria and the impact of not because our modern lifestyle today the overuse of antibiotics to overuse that helps advertisers of impact bacterial soap these other things that totally wipe out our good bacteria\nThat wipes out all of that that um the the friendly micro biome that ready to keep functioning properly um travel stress various kinds of medical conditions on all of these things can impact our microbiomes better off balance and actually study doctors believe that this increase and\nLike allergies you know food allergies at\nAn auto immune diseases and even ADHD and and the odd because of their thing these these record epidemic levels that we'd never before seen\nOr wet dog so if you ever smell your wet dog in your wine that it's likely to be a court date and this is supposedly\nAffects about one to three percent\nOf court to bottles although I've heard there is a court company now producing court ... free\nCorks surprise oh fabulous\nOne other fault which is actually kind of fixable it's called a lot of people who referred to it at reduction it's when you just open a bottle of\nWhite wine or red wine from maybe from a cooler climate it will\nSmell really strongly of like garlic or cooked cabbage rotten eggs or like a struck match\n... a lot of time this ... this happened when\nThey're bottled without very much much oxygen to the winds were like grab a sulfur molecules that of an oxygen molecule and that's why it smells like sulfur a lot of this is fix with they can't take\n'em so just opening of wine and putting it can't or even a white why it's strong can improve the flavor and your worst case scenario this is a really fun facts\nIs to put a silver spoon\nIn there to cancer or your glass to fix the problem the silver will actually reduce the compound side surprised that super cool\nSome things sometimes winds get over the oxidized\nAnd people call this matter as we know and cooking if you use mature and cooking this sort of\nSmell of Bruce apples men when the oil that kind of developed\nAnd that's from too much much oxidation up the wind will look around when it's a really oxidized\nAnd then what I loved to tell everyone and it's always a shocker and it's the reason why you shouldn't leave your bottles in the window is unique and sort of accelerate wind folks\nTo occur and so you know you when you smell the one with the movie damage even under fluorescent lights they did some studies you can get a UV damage and it'll smell it can cause court case it can cause reduction or it can cause all kinds of things\nI'm a lot of people describe it it's nothing like what will though if you have a bottle especially those with clear glass just make sure they're stored in a covered or away from directly\nGood it's a very important to camp and I think storage is so paramount\nOn let's explore if we could could you share a couple of lesser known but maybe up and coming great varietals from around the world that your loving on because your book highlights so many and I'm only halfway through my a graphic learning process\nWhere we have about a hundred grapes and winds included which represent over Seventy percent of the wines produced in the world in terms of um volume\nSo ah when you when you learn these groups and wind you're really getting the majority um that said there are some weird ones

said we told our clients to sell the November of ... and just stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself over time time heals all but\n... and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired are retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of us would say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody oh\nDon't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is a part of the show is jump on where we talked about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect which you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten ... so we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening talking about you [noise] um I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive pink thing that she does and it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a pie right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so Laura heard this and she sent me an email to ...\nWe had the best I\nCan tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone number as you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK anyway let's talk about in this house and it ate all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October issue and all that and at that\nTime you know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker or there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically\nAnd at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. and October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally of fell off a cliff so\nIs this like that I'm now in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs\nThat no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWell basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raise interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up\nIf interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars companies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week is the beginning of a new bear market recession all that\nKind of stuff but you know what it does do in my view it shouldn't be a wakeup call to you\nBecause did you did you see how fast it fell\nI mean it was like what eleven hundred points in two days I mean that's fast the market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly\nI mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did in Y. two K. or and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is it sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and you are contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want

I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd all the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over a thousand\nFour hundred families are in in forty three states oh and you know what it never ceases to our and me and in and and actually it it gives me enthusiasm and makes me want to go to work every day and do my best because uh you know it's such a wonderful thing\nAnd Financial Times named uh our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and that's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning as our primary focus\nAnd so that's you we love to help you if we could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are probably the most important\nA decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is when do you apply for benefits okay and it's not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two and Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wake you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens if they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take your sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is it is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you'll walk up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of\nYour life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said\nBecause then your spouse will get that higher benefits because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same okay so something for you to consider\nNow as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at uh we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nEr here\nFor you and our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter] so uh if you go to our website it is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd uh you you have two options when you're there one is you can sign up for one of our seminars and we have seminars near you and at the seminars we talked about three of the worst enemies that you are will deal with during your retirement which is a inflation\nAnd taxes or income taxes and of course Barry markets we also talked about uh do you have what we call your magic number will help you to calculate\nDo you have enough money to retire on\nOkay that's the big question we'll also talk about five strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes when you're retired we'll talk about how to maximize your cash flow okay so when you are retired is in my opinion it's all about cash flow you got to make sure you have the cash coming in to cover the lifestyle that you want\nAnd you know we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nOkay that means you've got to go play and have fun and you got to have the money to pay for all that stuff so we want to help you to figure that out we also talked about your four oh one K. and when should you take Social Security sixty two sixty six Seventy\nAnd how do you

one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors actually now for the seven year in a row\nAnd I'm very proud of that designation but without our clients that would be no aware at all so all your clients listening right now thank you so much a if you're not a client I encourage you to go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net you can learn more about us we have podcasts of the show you can go back to listen to a\nWe have articles on retirement planning topics we have videos on the same so we have all kinds of stuff on there that I think you can benefit from um this is the part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs\nThe fruits of your labor and\nWe do this because money isn't everything but it sure keep the kids in touch does it not right on sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts\nLadies and gentleman you don't want to see unhappy squirts that's not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirt anyway this is the time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it Jack and you play it I Know I\n\nWould say you\nKnow my fog and may be empty\n\nAnd\nOf course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes in probate and all that kinda stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite and we don't want that to happen to you so therefore\nEvery week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes during that entire time so I thought wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIs an it's its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create it during your lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will upon your dad they read the will and it says create the trust so it can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it'll be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and the state taxes why\nWell because for example let's say that ah you know your your daughter gets a divorce\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trust inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child they're not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the in the honesty trust a ... it's called the generation skipping tax trust because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money\nAs trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiary can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support hams H. E. N. S.\nAnd you know hams is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in assets that they want to leave behind\nTo they're greedy and watched undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest if they are real estate or something like that so talk to you or a financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to on a farm\nOr financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you know what goes on our website it as money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there Dorothy guess what people will get they will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunks cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip chips made with ... they form they formed the chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate that melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or do you look at our our ... talk\nAnd while you're at it you're learning about your finances man to deal you can find nowhere else\nTo go to our website money matters a net now on the off chance that may be cookies or not what you want to go to us that are for although I Would highly recommend it\nAt the semi we could talk about three of the worst enemies you have to your financial well being talked about inflation you're talking about income taxes beer markets we'll also talk about how to calculate your magic number which is a if you have enough money to retire on\nWe're going to talk about your cash flow Matt and maximizing cash flow junior retirement we'll talk about what you should be doing with your four one K. right now we'll talk about when you should take Social Security when you're sixty two sixty six when you're Seventy we're going to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want to tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits and we know show you how to beat that if it's at all possible we have so much information at the center I Can't even tell you all about it right now but go to our website money matters dot net\nSign up for the seminar and we'll look forward to seeing you there you know what I can not believe how fast the show has gone it's over already I Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I enjoy doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody\n[noise] information presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis of a sudden you discuss and should not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned none of this show's content should be viewed as personalized investment might a professional\nAdvisor shitty consulted before implementing any of the strategies presented\nNumerous times or the vastness involved with varying degrees of written and therefore can be no insurance any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for at lying or fully tax\nPlanning information offered on this program is general in nature always been told and attorney or tax\nProfessional regarding your legal ... founded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of can rape or and then don't you I Am advisors and I'll see the from only transaction visit in states where it is not really registered or is exploding or exempted from registration requirements registration is not an endorsement affirmed by securities regulators and does not mean that the advisor\nHas a particular level them feel more ability\nShow furnished by money matters with cameras\nCould take out an attack ad on your favorite candidates\nOr you could just keep the money and vote for him your\nCall ready they'll win\nWars have six minute injury here the\nNational key word and ... and nine five eight one\nNight where your shots at one thousand dollars or more times a day for K.

right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market's going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as\nDifferent directional vehicles go well you could always sit here and say\nWe know that when the markets go down there's usually people playing out of the market's going somewhere either could go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock chart bond chart gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again\nA lot of people been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now imagine that we had a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy right you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you gonna wait 'til a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirect chili ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go into reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know this the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kinda tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's what they do for a living you know real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what

structure it online trading heavy really shut the life on this turns the market is one of my favorite topic though talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money is the market's going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to rebuild this is a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion ride you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy taking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the happy classes whenever we talk about anything even at the happy class we always talk about risk versus reward and and\nAnother student says ... al ... and ... and that's something that I had always wanted to death and Sal as I'd I'd die for that had a chemical or star Taylor that changed my life to\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class

sunny afternoon with high sixties service suffers\nMore news coming up in thirty minutes continuing coverage of K ABC dot com and I'm Steve telling talk radio seven Ninety ... ABC News\n[noise] you're listening to power trading radio [noise] welcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director constructive element and top instructor at online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of income we talked\nA little bit about passive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first a skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm gonna practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same that that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death but really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just 'cause it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and all that is true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we were going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student email me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is what I got the mortgage that got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach your students right out of the gate\nThat if they could come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big up from the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent dropped Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year and that drop happening I think it was fourteen months\nAll right so that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and said yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to another half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and they have to Costa Rica and see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed\nWith lessons from some of our top instructors\nTo professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when ... and I tried to stayed on the show as much as I can whether you have two dollars or two million dollars would that be classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring
