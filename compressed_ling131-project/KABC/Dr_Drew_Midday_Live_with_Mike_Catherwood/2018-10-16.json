I've heard um yeah I've heard that in the middle east pronounce it showed\nThe show gave his death or the he said pump AOL right or right over to Saudi Arabia to talk to the king and the crown prince\nAnd ah we have no idea where that came out of that Ryan I'm certainly certainly is not somebody short on opinions and um he I'm sure we'll have something to tell us about what we should do what we're likely to do and the complexities\nOf the situation with Saudi Arabia gather it's not just about oil there geo political considerations there are\nTerrorist organizations that presumably they're keeping an eye on there's Iran there is the fact that we supplied God Knows how many billions of dollars a military arm it yeah so there's a lot going on here it started right we've got to get it all out for its by Dr ... seven Ninety KBC ... news Rob Marco [noise]\n\nBoy ... six nine new injury here the national keyboard and testing nine five eight one\nNight or your shot one thousand dollars\nThere's certain books written by you beat up pickup\n... Los Angeles Orange County are you [noise] have\nYou seen news alive and the local at one o'clock I'm Rob ... police in Anaheim conducted a murder investigation this morning after a man was stabbed in\nLeader died officers responded about one AM to a strip mall on west Lincoln boulevard regarding a possible stabbing located the injured are believed to be the thirties and then they took him a hospital where he died police still trying to figure out exactly what happened and find witnesses to the crime\nYeah I think that's a lot of added pressure not just from the media I'm not just from a you know just not on party but from the international community I just don't think that um I think that Trump going to start going to keep very very quickly about\nSpeaking a record of you for the Washington Examiner Microsoft right is what what are the range of possibilities there which is not about punishing Saudi Arabia I don't think we need tools at our disposal do we\nThe most we can do is just cut off they cut off our arms deal which I'm really does not want it\nMany of them there yeah\nYeah I mean maybe he can pull they can pull us out of conferences maybe the EU and the kid to condemn them internationally um\nThe other thing I saw somebody somebody saying we should send oil prices lower there is a zero probability of that happening we do nobody can control oil prices particularly at a time when we're about to hit a major bump up\nYeah yeah I don't I don't know what else we could possibly do this will be a wonderful time for the for Saudi Arabia to just do some good PR may be subtle all the nine eleven families that are pursuing moving billion dollar\nAll that but that's a that's a thing that's a bargaining chip it's\nA lot of ... that just makes it all the more weird and I'm confusing relationship that we have with them because\nI mean is this the political posturing in the sense that of course Congress is going to come out and say we absolutely have to have a harsh you know punishment for Saudi Arabia and then the president and kind of like well let's hear what they have to say I don't want to do anything that's going to negate these major contracts we have with them and then you know things blow over [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean it is I mean the truth is that journalists are killed all of the world all the time I mean this was truly horrendous things ... some but it wasn't even even in\nSaudi Arabia they sent hit man to to turkey to kill him um yeah it was it's a terrific and I don't I you know a mate I you know what are we what can we do we can sit there and have the Senate condemn them were\nAll these uh pull out from this um Davos in the middle east conference do you have major ... means yelling out you have in Denver and knocking down I have four hundred million dollar off you know deal in the works you have people pulling out is that a drop in the bucket to Saudi\nSaudi Saudi Arabia I mean no offense but they I mean they they use hundred dollar bills to clean your tears west I mean this is not yeah this is not exactly\nWhat I'm saying that's why I don't understand what the what the what we want\nThe world stage together I mean that that\nThink is worse than the worst thing that can come out of this entire thing for Saudi Arabia is what's happening in Yemen I think that's really anyone want anything to come out in in the sense for where we want to actually exposed Saudi Arabia\nIs to expose them to the humanitarian crisis that we can just see if we can make this death worth something maybe it will be to stop the thousands of deaths that are happening in Yemen every single solitary mom\nWell it's interesting it's interesting to me that you're thinking this way because one thing I've noticed about President Trump busy\nShe when he starts to go shooting he takes everything into the ... possible range of what he might be able to use its leverage or is a big ocean can point and I kind of feel like that's the way you're thinking you're like what are the things we could possibly bad make better by virtue of negotiating around this this uh this scandal\nRight because there's nothing we can't bring the same back from the dead we can't we're not we don't we don't give Saudi Arabia you know sort of Saudi Arabia is too important of an ally to the president in terms of Iran so\nThat kind of out of it right on the e might do something we can condemn them on the world stage we could have the UN sanctions when you were one of the richest nations in the world and you have all this oil I don't know if that's going to really do anything\nThat has ... has the you've been saying anything I've ever really heard much\nYeah yet today they came out and they said that if this is if this is true and ... and turkey and Saudi Arabia did this we need to publicly condemn them and they're probably under pressure both pull out of Thomas's will\nProbably but I mean here's I finally decided to go visit their Stewart to you is that still exist as well it really\nOil and gasoline from Russia so what do they care right\nSo you know it's it's I don't I just don't see anything unless you sit there and you expose this and you use this to and take you back to either demand money from for the nine eleven family or what\nI like that that's a fascinating that's a really fascinating yeah nine billion\nDollars has nothing to Saudi Arabia\nAnd aunts or whatever and it could change kind of weirdly the course of history right it could change how this goes do how it's thought a lot of soda yeah\nIn many ways if they sort of I wouldn't call it taking responsibility but sort of make it would it be taking responsibility they probably do it and he said well they do it in some way where they'd probably\nNot do it but they'd be willing to offer compensation or something\nOf that I mean how they're going to get around that spent probably if they do admit to anything they would set it up and down the road I'm running rogue operation taking part in Saudi Arabia that the king had absolutely no kill more people\nBecause of all the way it was the theory for he didn't know if you had a\nHe said he had no knowledge of of this killing but that does knowledge and involvement is to separate say\nOr um you know involvement and sending people over there and knowledge that he was murder or two entirely separate thanks so uh it is a very choice words that that's like that's like um but Saudi Arabia's using right now\nAnd I think that the only thing that can possibly come of this in a positive stuff in my mind and maybe there's other things as one exposed what's going on in Yemen 'cause it is truly horrific how many children are dying there or\nWe use is to sit there and we demand you know they finally come through with the funds for the nine eleven battles\nHe let me I was on the other answer yeah I I think you're ready to go about where we are and that's an interesting interesting possibility there but I Want to switch topics were just a minute while we got you in the switch over to lives were born a few of them I don't mind or your choice words I thought you might have some choice words about that as well\nI mean I did my twenty three me I Am point three percent Sudanese so if ... wanted to do some diversity hiring I Am available\nYeah that that's a great I I just started to Greg gut felt he said he is two percent the Native American were nice to a hundred times what was it more it is\nWhat I Can't understand is how she took that test saw those results and look\nLike and then when I'm like\nNo one made her do that she chose to do and you're like\nWell there was there was a visual to where she stands there was a move or white family talking about your appropriation of some other heritage that is not bears clearly loved her so\nShe set on video that her parents couldn't get married because her mom was Native American war on video ... oh you look it up she says on video through multiple interviews over time\nThat our parents had a low because her grandparents wouldn't allow her father to marry a Native American woman I mean it's really insane um I you know ... Democrats have had the kind of two weeks that Republicans\nUsually have war just insane videos that and have you seen that number over an Arizona now\nEven watching recruit cinemas the Democratic Senate candidate from Arizona and in two thousand nine ten eleven she was a big big progressive now she's a moderate 'cause she's running for us but she was saying that Arizona is the map slab of democracy\n[laughter] it's not something that they our zone\nIs Lindsay Lowell hand crazy um that there's nothing good that comes out of Arizona and the news oh she has like a ripped Arizona part national right for us that oh she said that um when she was campaigning against the war in Iraq I guess what she said you know I'm proud patriotic Americans who joined the Taliban\nOh I'm a wife and they're all on video and [laughter] and one or two she just didn't even to lead her tweets and its\nListen I have to say as a woman we have to be really aware that just because we're seeing now we do not account for every single voting block I\nThink that we've made very clear in the last election and you just want to reiterate that this time\nWas funny you say that because I think the Democrats are thinking\nThere's room we have so many women running we've somebody when am I I Do not agree that women have you're not a unified block just like men aren't unified voting bloc that is true right well a hundred\nOutgrew well the the the ... last yesterday came out of Christ and send them out\nWas disturbed by what she has seen in the fifth district she represents with\nA stretches from the antelope valley San ...

Nightline gender and different than your biology and why don't we have two categories one for your actual biology and one for your gender or how you feel as your identify and maybe we're going to need to do the same thing with background especially if we're getting certain benefits um to certain classes or ethnicity\nWell I think the problem is going to come and say that when these laws are basically what you were born with versus what you identify clashes relates to the law in some titled public public sentiment there is a um a store going on now where a transgender may fight or a\nFight off the mail and basically crushed her stall you know and they say that oh you shouldn't be allowed to that so I mean where where where where do we draw the line right there when the line is drawn you know who who determines where it is you know because\nI always thought to be somebody at that particular point because if you let's say for instance you extend it to sports was it what about a female who says why can play basketball very well ... I'm somewhat like Brittney Griner was like six seven she might be able to handle herself a little not maybe as well as a man in the NBA what she can say oh I don't even get the chance\nAnd other people like that it was on a draw that line and the sad you know when it comes down to the military I was going to have women or women seals women rangers or special forces delta force at all those things that we're going to have women doing those things also if they say they want to do it so I think that the laws and the\nThe law is going to have a difficult time dealing with um\nThe identification of how you can listen identify as angry at and what exactly they are do\nYou think that those legal actions are going to come in through the case challenger going to come in his legislation through the legislative bodies I don't know I don't quite know where it's like when I was out and they go ahead will most likely it's\nGoing to start is with a discrimination lawsuit someone is going to have raised the issue that I'm being discriminated along these grounds for this particular reason to bring attention to that particular subject similar to the transgender bathroom issues\nThat wasn't an issue until someone brought it up was going to take some form of discriminatory act or perceived discriminatory act against someone for it to be brought to the front to create it legal front for the for the conversation that take place\nAnd it also brings up an aging DNA testing and everybody's getting their DNA done you know what am I allowed to claim I mean obviously we're talking about the Native American you have to have a certain percentage by law to be you know put on um the last ... euro for Native Americans but\nFor someone like me I find that your oh my God I'm six percent African can I now take part in you know check that box off when I sell things out I mean it's going to become quite cloudy especially when we don't look like um what we say we are on paper\nWell yes that is true especially given the fact of like I said we have a very homogeneous country here and there was a lot of interracial marriages of all forms black and white a yeah Asian and white or whatever so the genealogy as well as\nHistorical colonial possession of the planet we have a lot of mixed genealogy is in this country so the question said it was getting to a point where it's the question is what will be asked is it necessary to have those type of identification at all\n... or or go the other way are we going to go all the way into\nVery sort of highly scientific standards are and definitions of what it means to be filling the black heritage and if this I'm not even use the word I'm intentionally not you know where to this city because and race because those are those are hotly contested\nUm ideas whether they really exist biologically you you know word of the word those kind of we have no idea we can't agree on is that right\nWell it would seem you know almost as kind of like Hollywood shows you a glimpse of the future all of these things are given rise to a situation where we may have had\nIn the movie I don't know if you saw it and get to go where the genetic engineering of children was very important at that particular time so where exactly you're from and and what exactly percentage you have if we get to a very specific scientific level on that\nI think that would be more discriminatory method could possibly be used as a more discriminating\nMaybe you're right away with it\nTotally does do you think people would be willing to take the Native American tribes I don't think they're going to be willing to totally do away with it because there's so much at stake not only the perpetuation of their culture but we were talking to somebody who was whose father was one of the Native American\nDistributions of the casinos that thing or a certain certain legal privileges as a as a ton of the nation I mean I don't think people are going to give that stuff up easy\nWas the question the question though without to be asked is when you're relating to your particular culture and the definitions of your calls you're are you talking about these self contained system of your culture or how is that culture interacting in an economic\nWay with others you see that will be the primary thing we talked about stuff like the casino privileges and that you're getting them because you're a map of Native Americans or things like affirmative action where you're getting them because you're African American\nSee those are really the economic involvement in the in the U.S international economic structure at all but your community and propagation of your culture is something that you can do no no matter what\nRight but but I Would imagine people again we because we have a new well\nWe're kind of a new concept called the cultural appropriation people don't want people that aren't actually from their culture and you're wrong with it yeah I'm here anything right in saying that this is everything we're all are talking about here to me is the kind of reckoning I think is upon us are you in a rare breed points and I think\nIt makes me think of the more you know further complexities and all this but I think\nI didn't expect to be having this conversation this week you know what I mean I think that would warrant brought something to the fore that has been percolating around and now here we are talking about it\nWell I mean I think pretty much the understanding that we're going to really what it's really going to come to is your\nRegardless of your genealogy because we don't control our genealogy is no one is able to pick their parents\nYou see yeah so what you're really talking about is what when you say identification really what have you live\nWhat what experience have you have you lived a Native American experience you see Elizabeth Warren has not even though she may have some Native American blood she has not live the Native American experience and that is the dichotomy so when you have\nPeople when you try to that is the appropriations\nBut now it turned out that Elizabeth Warren didn't know a let's say she was forty five or fifty per se as she didn't know for some reason that I think that that will be different but the person with a small amount of genealogy which basically means that there was some sexual relations going on somewhere back in the day\nYou know I think it's different than what it is you actually live\nSimilar just another point you're bringing up another good point and these are all things that we must reckon with somehow but I've got to say I've got to a safer ... works for people find you\nOh well I was Johnson's adjusted farm in Atlanta Georgia I can be found on the end of

you say\nHow you doing doctor drew goods or what's up\nWell interesting that all of this conversation comes out of political tribalism I mean it's almost like a bad pun but a war and who\nYou know was told something better parents put it on some things never got any scholarships or money out of it and yet it becomes an issue name start getting cold and yet we can turn around and Kevin McCarthy from

nowhere for Seventy billion dollars I was a possible the right to tell the around the country\nThat I mean is that there's something that we should be testing like you were saying that we should be using science and and ignoring this out\nI think we do that but it but it's interesting to me I think you brought another really interesting point which is isn't it fascinating that the tribalism of the day is leading us to look for actual trial right or actual genetic trucks and baby rocket will come out of it\nIs kind of a wash maybe we'll all realize oh what are we doing you know maybe we'll come out of the wouldn't\nYou know sort of been ... become Americans rather than ...\nIsn't that isn't that the way we should be I mean come on\nThere it is but it's so funny to me because the same people looking up their ancestry are like oh look I'm part South American and I'm part that's the same people that want to keep him [laughter] you know out of the country that that uh we should have law and order so it's this weird\nDichotomy that we set up where we're all proud of our heritage and yet we want to keep America like it had right now\nWill be part of the British thing and I'm sure
