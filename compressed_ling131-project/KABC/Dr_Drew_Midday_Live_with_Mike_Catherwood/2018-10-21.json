{"content": "So what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego in a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job and I love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the stuff that you go through it very very first conversation these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake or use these bum a pair of skis for him and rather than a hall in mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just\nDown to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do there is to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now\nYou got a half day class coming up in your area they have to ... ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really take control your retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these have to take classes to get your phone's writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com\nAnd see if you can score some passes there now Larry one of the things that I always liked to say and I said earlier on the show as it doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and\nReally getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after ... what are some of the things are what are some other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of each of these examples of our students that you've talked to\nThat we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're\nDoing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming after the holiday season again we're going to start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if your coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and ... and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked June or your training before or after college she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you say we do another give away yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here All right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're

iconic wind families but\nHis success is entirely to his credit and there's wind knowledge and life lessons to learn from him than I Am delighted to have you here thank you for stopping by\nSo much for a lot of\nCourse I don't think you and to me on okay let's talk about your dad first at the he's the famous rock music producer turned so now in the valley winemaker he's Bruce cone as a and B R

and relate to him somewhere or right yeah um you know\n... where we started\nOut of freedom for ... um which would make the right one and you know but when the you know a great song and have a moment or the experience of of wind does and it also comes back to\nAn assault on them for years and that's a beautiful thing\nIt is a beautiful thing and I know that you learned to that and you were taught that and you were immersed in it\nBut when you launched your brand you did things very differently than you watched or were taught you didn't buy land on you you didn't uh spend the the time hiring winemakers in forming a team and\nDesigning you know choosing ... all the things that one would have to do if they were a starting a tasting room and a winery\nYou tapped a network of friends I you build\nRelationships right and you're very much praised for thinking outside the box\nYeah but you're yeah are you know in order to raise raise a lot of pro so that goodness you're going to go to my grave our buddies\nAnd a long term contracts growers where um where you\nKnow the only way I can control the quality rise this year after year after the uh the consistent quality or the money right and I couldn't ... with my name on it\nAnd like breakers and there was a fire at one time um so for me it's got to look like a hundred it's got to drink like a fifth year it's gotta be twenty five right and not perceived value is actually a reality and other than that you know also there's so\nMany great you know cabernet is out there but how many of them are really every road so making a great governor Italy is all about birding with or a bottle at a time for me so you know I feel like not everybody can make it to the one country\nSo I really like the wine country so ground that's why federal guards are because I Do on the road\nYeah three hundred and eight days last year\nOr this or that kind of over\n... which by the way it makes your wife a St Louis yeah absolutely there\nThere is a very well done Forbes article about you on that I read over and over because I thought the lessons and the profile that day sharing really highlighted a ... what you have I\nI think not meaning so have taught so many entrepreneur or are showing us along the way and you just alluded to in your mission and your philosophy in a nutshell is it you're bringing the California wine country to a Flagstaff Chattanooga places that might not know\nIn a way that is so small but so grand at the same time and I know that your mission end goal is to duplicate this concept so as to spread the love\nPer se um but if you would add share your philosophy and your respect for our ecosystem because you're doing good and good begets good\nYeah well you know the stewardship of of this planet is a very important endeavor and uh\nAnd I got turned on the the the the power of of agriculture as a as a capability of nursing people on the planet I when I was a teenager mhm because as a surfer growing up and in Newport Beach I ... I I learned a surfer the foundation for the studies and university that\nAgriculture is the number one push that our oceans and that just didn't make sense to me um and so\nFor many different reasons one to the potential extinction of my passions but ultimately to the the building blocks of of culture food how how is it about as a as a detriment to our environment so the last Twenty years I've been out of ... to\nRe imagined food as a as a driver for nourishment our communities and so what I came back to the ecology center and at that time we were to our property for her it was one acre for small\nA small enough as a as a garden and not necessarily a working farm and so we really wanted to set the table for gr and community\nAs sort of go deeper relationships with those fishermen farmers ranchers et cetera that are doing the hard work or are they are committed or or farmlands and [noise] and our precious natural resources in a way that's meaningful I'm\n... and so we've done many different things that really celebrate them but you know does that work is really really hard as as maybe you know I'm\nI think we all get a glimpse of it the chef or off and get the celebrities here our work is really trying to say thank you for the call her community but really start to focus on the the hard work but it's happening and the agrarian side effects\nYes and and you're bringing light to it and you spread the gospel and it's working right I mean you've seen gross not only of your own but also your outreach\nYeah yeah I Know we've seen a lot of I mean we started with a dirty word I mean it was a law here yes I'm\nAt a at a young\nPassionate individuals myself that had come off of seven and eight years of working internationally a lot of America and Africa with\nA passion that says if these ecological cause that's needed to be grounded in the crazy county of consumerism code orange\nCounty yes or no we don't want to get rid of Robert riffing exponential growth every year and now and the one that doesn't transformative Crawford for us\nYeah it really is and we're celebrating your tenth anniversary and I'm Sorry that you've not grace the show enough times in the past to share the plight um but also the gross itself and so we're starting now I Love that you are going to be on the map in a different perspective\nTo love the land and appreciate does that nourish us and\nYou've made a difference do you have the backing of Alice Waters not so bad and I have to say and the recipes in the book are\nFresh and fabulous and I\nHappen to love a collaborative cookbook because you get a taste of so many different chefs palate spray you really get a a cross reference perspective\nUm which I I Love so I Can't wait to uh to share the book and of course I'll share with my listeners how they can get their hands on a copy what Ken each of us do today in our city our town\nTo better planet earth give us a ... give us a homework project please\nYou know it's I think it's easy you know let's turn to be the best for the world of the best in the world ... um\nWhat a concept of it is for the world instead of the best in the world\nIs so let's let's let's remember what's important in a way that we want to nurture family er nurse or very well on a reader and across the street and break bread with our neighbors are\nEasy to make America more philosophy or worry\n... culture I Love that word means ecological design but it really comes out of ethics and I want to promote those in this moment which is a reporter for the planet mhm we care for people and we redistribute the surplus or what I think the short answer here where we have a surplus let's hear what we share the wealth and\nThat our corner foods for him to do that for that they do their time and there are children\nOf it but we all have something to do and so I think that's an easy thing to figure out what your furniture them yes or the other thing is by local food and buy organic food or not or get it for like earth for laws like go to a farmer's market and build a relationship with your neighbors and ...\nA and a farmer's market of approachable\nYes and tasty apple and complement a farmer on the radishes because they're spicy and delicious and because they were picked by hand and you know what that's all the more reason\nTo see them out in the world yes the less critical more loving were\nOkay I'm all for that I'm going to follow in your footsteps I Will continue to support the ecology center and the crowd to I'm thrilled for the release of this cookbook and\nI Believe that everyone should see it and have one because as Evan marks says celebrate the harvest the ecology center is a non profit organization located in San Juan ...

okay so we want to make sure that you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that and philosophically how that would apply to you\nThat when you retire we specialized work with people who are retired or retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad business or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just last year money you're you're you're not financially have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you scan for\nYou know one of the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life okay\nSo in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six a core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay\nSo that's the first thing always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's\nAbout what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that what will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something\nYou know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is\nIt will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if it's for example just if you lied on your resume to get a job and you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrifice honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise] now\nOne

motorcycle insurance to going to go [noise] oh [noise] guard got fifty minutes could save you fifty percent or more on motorcycle insurance\nAnd that this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over a thousand families\nSo [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently uh barons named Moran you're faithful host one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row and uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we're talking about\nOur philosophy of a of a business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business\nIs the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life and so I think that uh this week's at this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with eight thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of a family of grandparents do you have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that I just didn't grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we created will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now\nAnd if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taking care of and so well they're down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think families so to apply this to you personally families that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do as noble if we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do\nBut in the broader context and how would you would apply to in your life you know I I my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted\nThat because we're married you know the old song that you know I I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay\nSo now you got to keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters\nWe want anybody that comes to ah talk to us it is not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time\nTo have that person understand that every single time don't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way you take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe that as our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not\nAnd what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net is our website money matters dot net\nAnd do you have three things that you can do there or I Want one is you can get my market alert email it's free goes out at least weekly and or you can subscribe to that also you can click on meat with an advisor you can sit down with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be professional friendly knowledgeable\nAnd they will that help you to build your financial plan and I will do all that at no charge obligation and if it helps you fantastic and if it doesn't you know what that's fine too we will part French\nAnd then finally you if you don't want to do any of those things that you can also do a third thing which is you can go to one of our seminars\nAnd over the years we've had thousands of people attend our seminars and uh I think they've enjoyed them and you can learn about your retirement planning your a diversification Social Security all those kinds of things\nAnd a ... and and and lots of information at our center some money matters dot net is our website for all of the above money matters dot net All right we're going

two\nPlays register for an upcoming retirement seminar on Tuesday October twenty third at courtyard Marriott Pasadena old town and on Tuesday October thirtieth at the woodland hills country club by going online money matters dot net oh it\nWas a um [noise]\n\n[noise]\nMoney\nAnd we are back this is money matters of Kenmore rape and of course I Am your host ...\nThank you Jack I've been in ...\nWell services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are\nThe same ideas we talk about what are the love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nHours without our ... and most of your clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is\nThat I Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on families that are you're doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility you know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for\nAnd that responsibility is is something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisor referring die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be a strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are a bad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do\nTherefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them so that is a culture that is the values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or or or or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that endure overtime regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these\n[noise]\nBecky jak I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talk about with our love it and most valued clients and we work with over a thousand families into\nAnd they found beyond absolutely\nAnd we work with ... forty three states\nAnd all the ideas we talk about on the show these are the same ideas we talked about what our beloved and most valued clients as I mentioned Forbes named our financial advisory firm money matters one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states and without our clients will be nowhere so thank you\nAnd those if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff\nThat if you're over fifty retired are retiring soon is important and uh so we we talk about the estate planning which we're going to do here and just a moment but we also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes are diversification for one case\nWe talk about the whole ... a whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is a part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean or Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter]\nThere you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing sticking your ear and a Q tip stance for qualified terminal interest property but do we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trusted is designed to benefit your spouse\nSo if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that ... can you play it\nI Know I\n\nWould always say you you\nKnow my log in me\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that\nTo happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the feel of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters and\nAs I mentioned a little bit ago ... we ... we're not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have an actual security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory prompted die before you do\nSo we created in our from what we called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical um and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\nIt's not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love then somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe\nThe more love will come back to you and you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will come to you so our core value number eight is everyone deserves love every one that comes into contact with us as a burn as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all to love that we have to get\nAnd if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so weak\nAnd so stay planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in and cannot come out no in fact just the opposite a Q tip trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the cutest trust\nOkay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to think about so this show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOn our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but uh I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way you have success you'll find happiness I think they're just core values that apply in all walks of life\n\nWell Dorothy it is do wonderful to be true because\nI Want to do some business with you right now ladies and gentlemen gonna bring it back into the capitalist world and that is that if you'd like to learn more about our financial advisory farm if you'd like to go to our seminars\nYou

I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we were like oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head it's we stop even trying you know a while ago they are you know I'm ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile\nA vis the about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back straight\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we end up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started we've got a stack of tickets here the show is just beginning we say we do need to give away let's do it right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area\nAnd a half day classes where you see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nNow in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these classes and so if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your passes who's going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some are top instructors now the professional insiders kids critical because it makes it so you can get started right now\nScholar century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight and eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there we're up against the clock Larry what are you have a force next\nYou know lots of students keep asking us all the time half I'm looking to make more income does that mean I have to get more jobs and the answer is absolutely no let's talk about south multiple streams of income on the other side of the break ...

they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more at free O T a class dot com that's free O T a class dot com\nWhite on and what these guys explain you\n\nI've been gay\nABC [noise] this is how retraining radio now back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humid Larry Jacobs director restructure development happens structure it online training academy shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income\nWhether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate any given generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money is made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined and so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a a a not so they're like that would not such a pleasant light we could say because\nWhen they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though\nWho look at a down market as a bad thing\nNow these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money is the markets are going up that's kind of situation our income in our retirement accounts or in\nIf we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that instead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money of the market going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nAbsolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational ... later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way\nTrade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question\nMarried by a\nHome a horse\n[noise] we just got\nWe're ... students who would do this time I'm going to really\n\nListen for your chance to win a VIP invitation to our Halloween bashed at the end Sean right in the little drive home the horrors live from the civil remind the Halloween and three by\nRounds money Nineteen ruin than\nBigger than ever [noise] you're listening to how we're trading Radio Welcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and top instructor at ... he's got to be really shed some light on different income streams inside of the market\nWe're talking a little bit about passive income we're talking about active and can we are talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we learned and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there and those multiple streams of income\nI really would create that financial freedom but everybody's after right not just that one source and that one source of income when you have that sole source that's why job stance J. O. B. right stance for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we wanted to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big us we've had big downs and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come\nAnd Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes via social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire or just not quite sure\nWhat they should be doing with it so what kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it that that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our\nAudiences the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody here it's going to protect your capital better than you can right now and the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is this is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four one K. and he is a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and I've been doing this pretty\nPretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I wonder when to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at an all time highs\nNot when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their traits to be able to maximize\nFor their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nYeah it's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics were ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the markets still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kind of got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price\nIt's pretty much impossible forced to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets is whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that uh when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I Want to share it are there but it was just kind of funny you say you can't live or stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and then honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about\nYou know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end it was kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they are that the stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their money's into retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who's closing their retirement and they have this perpetual kind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money\nBut how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up uh falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nStay class coming up in your area that the costs of ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half day class including with your past is going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause tend to your twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the\nNumber is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there now now Larry still\nKind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside but also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little out of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are frantically waiting for it because it can be one of the best years of our lives\nA lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in\nAnd the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world has risk to reward how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or have take classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so so even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time\nWell what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your to your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about", "show_name": "Dr Drew Midday Live with Mike Catherwood", "station": "KABC", "day": "21", "city": "Los Angeles", "state": "CA", "month": "10", "year": "2018"}
