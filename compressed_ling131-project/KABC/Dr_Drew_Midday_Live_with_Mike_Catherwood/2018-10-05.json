C. A. at the Supreme Court\nFurthermore judge cabinets approach toward the doctrine of separate belote is narrow wind up part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds he has argued for severing be invalid laws\nAs surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact\nFence was his approach and his to send in a case that involved a challenge\nTo the structure of the consumer financial Protection Bureau in his dissent judge Kavanaugh I argued for quote severing any problematic portion wells and leaving the remainder intact\nAnd quote given the current challenge is to be a ca proponents including my cell phone protections for people with preexisting conditions should want to jazz says who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother assertion that I've heard often is that judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come before the court\nThe basis for this argument seems to be twofold\nFirst judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution\nOr civil liability while in up a\nBit surprised so now I Believe opponents miss the mark on this issue the fact that judge a cabinet I offered Vince legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have\nSuch protection currently\nSecond there are some who argued that given the Kurds special counsel investigation President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate adjust to\nThat argument ignores our recent history\nPresident Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she was come first served Ninety six to three\nThe next year just three months after independent counsel Robert fifth was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton nominated justice briar\nHe was confirmed ... eighty seven to nine\nSupreme Court justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them\nPerhaps most notably in the United states versus Nixon three next send up point keys who heard the case joins the ... opinion against him\nJudge cabinet I had been unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law\nHe is stated that ... versus Madison Youngstown failed versus Sawyer and the United states versus Nixon are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases and the history why do they have in common is\nIs a case where Congress served as a check on presidential power and I would note that the court case the judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as some the greatest thing history was brown versus the board of education\nOne cabinet dissension illustrates the point about a check on presidents empowered directly [noise] he wrote the opinion and I'm Don\nVersus the United states a case that challenges the Bush administration's military commission prosecution of an associate of uh some of bin Laden\nThis conviction what's very important to the Bush administration but judge Kavanaugh who had been appointed to the D. C.\nCircuit by President Bush and hadn't worked in President Bush's White House rule that the convictions was sons last fall as he explained during the hearing quote we do make decisions based on who people are\nOr their policy preferences or at the moment we base decisions on the law and the\nOther side's Mets with have expressed concern said Justice Kennedy's retirement threatened the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh\nIs more of a centrist than some of his critics maintain it's reflected in the fact that he and chief judge Merrick Garland voted the same way\nIn Ninety three percent of the cases that they heard together in the chief judge Garland joined in more than Ninety six\nPercent of the majority opinion authored by judge Kavanaugh\nDissenting only won\nDespite all this after week separate viewing judge Kavanaugh's record and listening to thirty two hours up his testimony\nThe Senate sit by and consent role was thrown into a tailspin following the allegations of sexual assault by professor Christine ... for\nThe confirmation process now when the fall of value of waiting\nWhether or not judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee [noise] some\nArgue that because since it's a lifetime appointment to\nOur highest court court the public interest requires that doubts the resolve to get the nominee\nOthers see the public interest as embodied in our longest established tradition of a forwarding to those accused of misconduct a presumption of innocence\nIn cases in which the facts are unclear they would argue that the question should be resolved in favor of the nominees\nMr President I understand both viewpoint this debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial\nBut surgeon fundamentals legal principles about due process the presumption of innocence and fair that's due bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nIn the value waiting any given claim of misconduct we will be ill served in the long run if we a band and the ... son ... in the sense and fairness tempting though it may be we must always remember\nThat it is when passions are most in playing that fair and that is most in jeopardy the print some shouldn't have been since it's relevant to the advice and consent function whenever she accusations depart\nFrom it nominees otherwise exemplary record I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public space and the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process\nMoving forward some of the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor for\nBut if the allegations that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drugs multiple girls and use their we can stay ... gang re\nFish out last ditch\nAlec cage was put forward without any credible supporting evidence and simply pirated public statements some fathers\nThat such an allegation\nCan find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness\nMr President\nI listen carefully to Christine ... for testimony before the Judiciary Committee I found her testimony to be sincere painful and compelling\nI Believe that she is such a survivor of a sexual assault\nAnd that fits trauma has up and did her life\nNever the labs for when it said she named could not corroborate any of the events that evening gathering where she says the is solved\nNone of the individuals professor poured says we're at the party has any recollection at all of that night\nJudge Kavanaugh forest fully denied the allegations under penalty of perjury\nMark judge denied under penalty of felony that she had witnessed and the salt PJ snow another person allegedly at\nDenied that he was fair\nUnder penalty of selling them per faster sports lifelong friend liaison Kaiser indicated that under penalty of felony she does not remember that party and ms Keyser ...\nShe indicated that not only does she not remember and I like that\nBut also that she just not even know Brett Kavanaugh\nIn addition to the lack of corroborating evidence we also learned some facts have raised more questions for him since since these allegations have become public professor Ford testify\nThat not a single person\nHas contacted her to say I was at the party that night [noise] furthermore the protests are testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that because of the distance she would've needed or\nBright yet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the ones who drove her home or were in the car with her that night\nAnd professor Ford also indicated that even though she's labs that small gathering of six or so people look at ...\nAm without saying goodbye and to strive none of them call during the next day or effort\nTo ask why she lab is she okay\nNot even her closest friends ms ... Mr President\nThe constitution does not provide guidance on how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims it leaves that his says and up\nTo each senator this is not a criminal trial and I do not believe that the claims such as these need to be prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nNevertheless fairness would dictate that the claims at least should made a threshold of more likely than not as our standards\nThe facts presented do not me that President that professor for what's not sexually assaulted bats night or in some other\nTime but they do leads me to clues that the allegations fails to me the more likely than not standard there for I Do not believe that these charges Ken fairly per bad\nJudge Kavanaugh from serving on the court [noise] let\nMe emphasize set my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that I Want to sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country\nTo the contrary if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process\nIt has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the PR face of ... of this terrible\nProblem I have been\nOn my arms and just served however by some who have suggested that in last judge Kavanaugh's nomination it's rejected the Senate and some how can Joni sexual assault\nAn exemplary public servants judge teacher coach husbands\nDespite the turbulent bitter fight surrounding\nHis nomination my fervent hope\nIs that Brett Kavanaugh\nWill work to less than the ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\nAnd so that the

you have to say first well I can I just you can be bad now [laughter]\nI just I just admired I I oh you know I'm a big Abraham Lincoln fan and the one thing I really love about Abraham Lincoln easy all we laid out his logic in his speeches and they were always very super clear\nAnd I felt that she was attempting to\nTo do that a lot of the time I took copious notes on what you would say I thought it was so disjointed I couldn't follow well it was\nIt was it what it once it got off topic you know it would go from one topic to the ... that made it feel distracted boat but when it was digging into a topic like the constitutionality of article three of federal papers I thought okay I Want to hear this I Want to hear that kind of logic\nAnd and I appreciate it that I liked that she did that and um you know I I\nAppreciate it then and now we can get we'll get into the weeds on all the other things you talked about let's talk first though to state what he said\nGood luck to do long time listener uh I just wanted to say I do agree with Susan Collins I Believe that we're living in this era now where people are guilty until proven innocent and I don't believe his whole confirmation and basically body of work should be\nTrashed and dragged through the mud based on the allegations and the fact that this is simply a case of judicial temperament gone wrong I just feel that Susan Collins is correct she came to the correct conclusion speech was a little long winded but you know what I Believe that she understands the fundamentals of literature place here\n[noise] well I think again I that's the part of the speech I liked was her discussion about the fundamentals of what she thought her her responsibility was and how she render decisions for Supreme Court justices generally she's had what she says her fifth one\nOr ... or justice and she just wanted to apply the same yardstick what'd you think are\nA well according to one of our listeners over Twitter named lake show eighty four she was apparently going to talk until we've been Ginsburg seat opens up\nOut of an eye [laughter] well\nThat's that's a she nearly nearly a godsend nearly got there very

would you call it her uh her stalling\nRight to give us an answer I I think that was wildly exaggerated I think she had always going to the one you know and you know the\nSaturday they can make crazy

mean I Can't even get the feeling that I'm having right now in my car right now I\nShe that senator call and she laid it all out so I don't know what ... what a year the woman ... you hear it speaking Allen let's not listening to the same thing a speech that I was because she clearly state\nYou know I listen to that degree\nWell okay and that's you know that in your pocket but what I what I'm hearing from the things that she does\nA woman's claims she did not want to say that she did not believe what this woman said but she was making a very valid point about the process in which\nEveryone how'd you go through to get to this point on\nI was just so inspired by what she said that I Want to go off topic well everybody I mean where do you agree\nWith that Ruth or not I thought it was I thought it was congressional rhetoric at its best now am I wrong learn I mean at least at least it was I thought there was a lot of that Schumer was great today again just assessing the rhetorical\nTheir process I I thought that everyone did a really good job at the podium today oh let's ask Teresa what she wanted to say Theresa\nI thought it was a dog and pony show myself and ... well here's the problem it took ... years and probably not going for Garland because of the public and said they gave them one way and that's ... S C I could only intervene seven people and there were forty people that came forward\nWith us you know as with things that they were going to say supporter\nRight for a while I I don't mind but they they gave us they gave her a little\nBit of a rationale for that they said they were not going to interview people who were remembering that they had remembered that heard something because of the ... current and that's the one that does the charity of witness\nThat factor that people that live with him that say with it all out drunk but look he didn't\nDo that ... that I don't think it was even that that was that was allowed in there you know that wasn't even in there that that that horn light is that I read that\nOne yet that lied and that should be the bottom line and those people that didn't get to the interview that you read about it here about\nOn you know then they named their lane should have been there and and the other thing is you should take it a lot what time of the ... Republican majority in the Senate that will love it when the dog and pony show her ...\nDid you hear did you hear O'Connell or or Sherman through more this morning\nNot this morning I didn't\nI thought I thought that was pretty good I think that to me I listen to I thought I that's the way the Senate is supposed to function I are both both of them I thought did what they're supposed to do and I are or at least made me feel good to see that level of um [noise] process restored a talk to Tom tom what are you sir\nYeah Hi there how did you have like a you know what it is Loren correct\nYeah um yeah thank you hide their hey um I Do have something to say on a on a piece of thoughts are that lawn you\nMentioned earlier I felt that I thought I heard earlier this week that there is no statute of limitations within Maryland so could not Mrs Ford goats you de da is office within the county that this had is she has enough evidence to show for and still filed charges\nOr wherever or judge you\nYes absolutely except what we heard from the local law enforcement there was it not only could they not referred to the da because there wasn't enough evidence the d._a. wouldn't take it but maybe for political reasons they would\n\nYeah I I just feel that uh if there is again unfortunately I've been on one of these cases lately after the mess that violence and they found is a misdemeanor as opposed to a felony because there was not enough evidence produced by da da da da da to go to a felony type of situation so maybe that's what we're looking at here as well to\nA well not only not just not a misdemeanor not something they could refer to the da and not some of the deal would take a listen this is unfortunate people wait on these things but you know when we're all getting at here Lauren is the functioning of our legal system I mean but this was our legal system functions are we saying that needs to be changed\nWell I think it is changing I think we are raising me are the limits on when you can report these types of crimes because of the the nature of trauma and how victims come forward\nAnd record over at our friend has been instrumental in that the dentist what do you say\nYou had a Lauren I'm In in terms of its components in structure dishwasher job interview as opposed to a trial but there is a far greater more things at stake a man's reputation and the subject matter\nOf sexual assault I'm somebody said for the ... whip represented um the I forgot her name forward [noise] um he said if you come after her\nWe're going to come back at you two or three times more that kind of language and I never had a ... and the heat of a court trial\nShow it wasn't the court trials structurally and if\nHe wasn't going to go to jail he was going to be charged with any crime in fact just as dissenters came forward and said we believe Dr forward but we're voting yes on Kavanaugh they could have just ... just as easily say we do not believe the judge Kavanaugh\nYou know attached to this woman but we're not going to promote him to the Supreme Court\nYet we'll learn a a position on the Supreme Court goes beyond the the description of just a job it\nIs that the whole even more important okay show it to me the the stakes these the the importance of it falls somewhere in between a hearing\nBut keep in mind he's not the only candidate we would still have a conservative judge and the Supreme Court if it wasn't him particularly\nWell focusing my my my my argument on what's at stake it makes it more than just a job\nBut when you take for him\nWhat's at stake for the whole nation right spills over in and\nDo we agree [laughter] there's too much at stake for the whole nation to have someone in that job\nRight ... have even questions about their temperament job interview lie at their credibility saying\nToo much to the issue of the nation for some allegation that could not be corroborated to take down the process of sort\nOf my daughter's ... am I still on\nOh they can't hear me for some reason I'm so glad the caller here yeah of course here near me let's hear from now I can hear you oh okay oh go ahead\nOkay it's just the I

orchestrated is a tactical event to ensure that any conservative any Republican would not get that night seat on the court\nThat is all about and it came to a couple of callers back said that the College Board on the bus the Democratic staffer that leak information and the lawyers that lie to her do under the bus\nI think that's the point that Dr ... center recall it was making them\nI I did I mean I understand what she was saying that they were going to oppose any nominee but I have to bring up Neil Gorsuch\nWho did not have any of that circuit around his nomination and human ...\n[noise] uh the uh that's uh what about a ... what are you saying\nSay on what first thing I don't think this is the stage surface I got ridiculous because we know we're going to have a great service that justice issue long before you know presidential elections\nAnd the other thing is that um I think just the fact of and\nHis involvement with like the devil's triangle and both being in that were not an alumni shows his sexual perversion and I think that should add a lot of weight to Dr Ford allegations\nNot only that the fact that he lied about these things\nWhile exactly he lied about it all you ... ... oh my God\nWhat it'd be super clear if I were doing a clinical analysis for a behavioral analysis and I found that those references in your book and we were trying to determine whether somebody had a pair of Philly or something it would not even be noted\nIt we're not even saying\nShe was she saying he's a sexual pervert and that is a that is going way overboard formally I'm telling\nYou but as a man who's been brought up on sexual assault allegations right there on you and your mind where the law but that he's writing about who man and one woman\nOr if I were to court and I were the expert witness and I were asked to evaluate this guy for ... that would not get on my radar just the way it is that just the fact that I'm not saying you didn't lie about it I'm not saying that it shouldn't have made note in the hearing I'm just saying\nCalling him sexual bird because that is is going way over a let's say you talked to a Gino Gino when you say\nIt's all on the

preview there there nowadays\nRight back on the right hired and read and\nThis is rarely on that guy shoulder right\nBut I don't really know what I'm saying I mean he's\nHe's worse than Trump I mean on\nThe other thing I Know what to say I feel squarely on his shoulder and the other thing is\nI don't really care what he did in high school I don't really care what are you in college cap enough but he lied he like he made himself out to be a choir boy on Fox News he painted himself into a corner and then he couldn't get out\nThank you Jane appreciate your comments were going to talk to deanna

and had to speak over demonstrators while answering a question regarding the sexual misconduct claims made against Kavanaugh\nI think it's great you know she's finally standing up and I never thought I Would say this but she was quite buying less before I think\nAnd ah just like Senator at you know grand coming out guns blazing and finally taking a stance on all of this and saying that uh this really can't be tolerated anymore and Kevin\nIs being treated unfairly now we have a call and standing up and think that she's not going to tolerate this anymore so I thought it was brave and I thought it was\nI thought it was strong and powerful and we need more of that\nWill uh learned you want to ask your gives you you have very different feelings about it\nI Know I just I I I think that she\nFor the people that wanted his nomination to go through I think she said everything that they want to be here and she did lay out his um resume pretty clearly and the reason that she wanted to vote yes for him and she you know went into detail about discussions that she had with him about his\nJudicial um you know about his whole career um and for her she the the accusations against him weren't enough to to vote no so I think she did a good job of laying that out um you know me personally I did not want to think in terms so I Do agree with you or to you\nWhere you felt bad you didn't like like she didn't talk about who's drinking or his demeanor for some of the question leave\nThat out I mean no one talked about the relevant though it's really relevant if if he lied under oath\nAbout whether or not how much ... why the relevant if you lied about his drinking habits\nCould have been seen as a knock you with us about honest about it and\nYeah I mean right there\nIt's not enough corroborating evidence that he lied under oath about uh drinking habits\nWell yeah it's a multiple of his classmates saying they've been with him where he has been falling down drunk and there's no possible way that he can remember every single night of\nDream by weight I'm going to I'm going to the Washington Post ... that's different garner now that's not remembering or is it going to different than blackout\nThat Steven hospitable and your drink and that you wouldn't remember and he said no\nI Want to hear that I remember him saying a member of the ...\nYou know it's a lose lose situation for him because if he were to say that he did blackout then of course they would say oh well then during that one\nLower again our physicians regarding use our terms accurately or blacking out as a very specific thing not remembering things vaguely all memories affected by alcohol so for him to say my memory wasn't affected by alcohol well that's true of\nAll human it's yeah so you know you characterize\nI should he missed characterize his drinking I I I just didn't like\nWhat if we're going to I'm Sorry but if we're going to hold up ships confirmation and he does have a pristine record we're going to hold up his confirmation and say that he can't go through because of something that\nHappened in high school it because if he may or may not remember certain moments when he was drinking in high school sometimes they don't really know man it's safe from that I I don't know I\nThink that's not what Ronald enough it's not the behavior itself deanna that I had a problem with I don't think anyone in America would blame someone for their drinking habits when they were Seventeen years old my problem with him Mr characterizing his drinking and and you know between the Fox news interview\nAnd his testimony basically I he he lost credibility with me he was lying and there's so many people that have come out to say that he was lying and that's that's my biggest problem with a lot of\nPeople that came out to say he was telling the truth and what about Christine Ford lying on under oath she said that she had a fear of flying and then she also said in the same breath basically that she's been flying all across the country in the world in the last few decades with no issue at all\nWhen you could have a beer and why why I've I've I've I or ...\nYou know I don't anymore but I Do for a while and I still flew Scott ... go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean could hurt to get on the radio and claimed that somebody who is ...\nHe's like you said many many many many times you know the sort of job there is\nA you did accused of sexual assault he's lied under oath and others for the call him a little bit more investigation hopping more corroborating evidence to know I mean there's a lot of evidence now which is the the media when it first broke\nBought out corroborating evidence to the test to the hearing one day hearing more love Rudy yet I'm Still the three day FBI\nA buddy in investigation world says far enough brought out even more cooperated evidence so but he's saying is on go on\nGuilty until proven innocent ... in the investigations show more and more and more evidence that he is guilty I don't care about anybody comes out in the guilty of lying under oath\nOr guilty of a sexual misconduct forty years ago ... which was guilty\n... those those those I mean it's it's it's on the table that he lied under oath about drinking sexual assault with every little\nEvery little out every little bit more investigation shows more cooperative Doug if those of us are investigations into such trouble with what you already know\nDoes anybody else did you eat it at this point I mean there's plenty of\nEvidence that that he actually lied under oath or that she made up the story you know and uh\nWhat about the evidence and she made a similar idea where it went on her or her\nSaying that she has such that she coached somebody on how to take a polygraph test\nBut then that her belly woman claimed she had coached came out and said she was never coach or guilty you believe\nRight there so that may be telling the truth and people aren't obviously some people are lying here but why is it that automatically Brett Kavanaugh's lying and not her ...\nShe's not up for the job do you understand Dana he's up for the Supreme Court so if he lied under oath to me that just qualified due to the Supreme Court or the United states where\nI Am curious was gone somewhere where it's got what what was the corroborating evidence you're talking about our cars are because of what I understood was they couldn't find corroborating evidence that's why the least as Susan Collins wait it out they could not find corroborating evidence\nThat's why they wrap up the I should get a clear and under a microscope and the FBI looking at it for a week\nIs less than a ... student leak in the U.S we people who does lead something than those people don't cooperate in Oregon was already\nDo or what I heard was what ... what I heard was that again I'm trying to be this pressure over is that the the wherever we are felt they should interview only potential are witnesses and the people who feel they her maybe about something secondhand\nThat they elected not to interview I I don't know if that's standard practice or not but that they were just strictly looking at our witnesses of that particular event and there were three right\nAnd there was some other ... airport of people but you know am I missing the point on that or or am I wrong\nI think that you're right I mean they they've looked at him now seven times throughout the eye and they wrapped up the uh the rights of the investigation and they couldn't find anything and they will they interviewed witnesses that she said were important and that he said were important to their uh she they also asked her to turn over her therapy notes and she didn't do that\nWe should all be clear she was on her new obligated to do that because to be super clear she was under no obligation to do that\nAnd he did say what I Will hand over there was there as well as my polygraph exam to the FBI when they interview me but\nThey never did so that's interesting that doesn't seem right or the ... the early never talk to her I just don't think she should have said over her or medical records of heated offered to when she got over here we are the ...\nWhy not if she said that there are there are squad corroborating evidence in the therapy notes which is what she said several times then wouldn't that be important piece of evidence for the FBI to look through\nWhat is using to her being a piece of the guys they they are where the woman making the allegation\nFrom what I heard that they did try reaching out to her several times that she wouldn't accept the interview you know there are\nTimes I don't know where you heard that I did not see that anywhere and word from her lawyers as otherwise where did you hear that just so we can look into that they're\nAll have to see it was definitely a I think it might have been the New York times that might not Sheryl ...\nBecause it seems like something that would of at the national press if that were true but again there's\nI mean to me the just this conversation last five minutes just to put the spotlight and we're all just inflamed whether it's just so inflammatory role we're all cannot like it's very hard to sit and just imagine if this were a criminal case trying\nTo parse out every little piece of evidence that people couldn't do it because there is so much a much fewer above sorry I even\nYou know I it's hard for them to even really do a thorough investigation anyways when she doesn't really know when this happened she doesn't know exactly where it happened who the person house was write a who dropped her off or took her from the place\nSo there are so many holes in the story and so many missing pieces of evidence that it's difficult for for them to even take it on\nAnd we had also\nSay that it would be as a sex crime investigator she wouldn't even take it on right because it's a it's just missing so much evidence right now I guess\nYou know the ... the whole greater scheme that says you know there's also some holes in Dianne Feinstein story uh there's also some some very suspicious things you know pieces of this whole story that you bring it up so late\nOnline or but I I'm an arm of the stand with Susan Collins on defending Dianne Feinstein I thought that was
