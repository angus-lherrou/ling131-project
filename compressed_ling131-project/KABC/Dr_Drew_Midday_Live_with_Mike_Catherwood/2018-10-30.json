local at one o'clock I'm just a little and the Anaheim\nThe or they also laid out how pregnant they are because that is one of the questions\nRight Somali immigrants somebody welcome it yes\nYes so we're we're good and we're sort of ... about president birthright\nCitizenship thing I mean obviously there is no doubt it's been um ... taken advantage of exploited by people who just come here have what they call an anchor baby so that their baby has citizenship and\nThrough the years have gone up drastically back in Nineteen eighty there were about thirty thousand babies born to illegal immigrants in the U.S and back in twenty fourteen\nTwo hundred and Seventy five thousand\nYeah the the numbers are standing and the sad thing is is there so these people that are coming here to have babies are so ill informed than the law because what they think is that they're going to\nCome here to have a child and then when the child turning Twenty one then there'll be able to get their green card or apply for their papers but that's not the case because there's no way\nBy releasing that back because it\nBecause the rule just says with the law on papers says\nYou can be petition for by your Twenty one year old child but what it doesn't say is if you enter an illegal leave there is no waiver available from a child to a Paris because when you're here legally you need to get a waiver right if I married someone here that was here legally I Would have to follow a waiver for them but there's no waiver that works backwards to parents\nOh interesting so if I just came here for vacation let's say right and I happen to have my baby here\nUm and I go back to my home my home country my baby is a citizen of the U.S yes\nYes but um and I can I apply based on that considering I wasn't there illegally\nAs long as you enter with a visa you didn't violate your visa you went back to your country and you have been violated refuses says she didn't stay a hundred and eighty days past technically on paper yes you could get your same\nBut if someone ... of the problem is that people just see the rule\nChild petitioning for parents Twenty one twenty what an older what they don't see is unless you unless there's some nuance rules basically if you enter with a visa or if you're an old application before two thousand one which a lot of people still than\nPeople that I got a turn away cases daily because someone will call me in the back my son just turned Twenty one I Want to get my green card\nWeird mix going around\nYeah and because they just see what's the hard line rule and paper with you with us yes they don't see it's always never told the people that\nIf you're here illegally you or not that's not for you\nWrite your ... your parents are us citizens and you can get a waiver through your ... your own parents or the kids' grandparents but usually that's not the case where there was a gap in person between grandparents and grandkids\nAnd so what do you imagine going to happen with this idea that Mr Trump floated\nI mean I\nI don't think that an executive order it can change the constitution per se I\nRecord their foreign range I really wanted to take it\nRight good news corps and make a decision about this\nI think it would be very unique for the Supreme Court to take on a decision like this to say because you have to think about the hundreds of thousands of cases that would be affected\nThat are either currently ongoing or have just been completed or think about the hundreds of thousands of people are millions of people that are ... ... ... a resident or green card holders\nBased on one person being a citizen of the u._s. and changing everything for the whole family\nRight repercussions here because there's people who you are right came here on vacation had a child family went back to whatever country they're from\nThe ... and ... they moved to America and if I didn't want to live here\nRight child gets that child gets mom and dad citizens\nInto chain migration can't they pull them over yeah\nYeah then they get their brothers and sisters citizens that you can affect millions of people\nWell let me ask you this though I'm Sorry go ahead no real quick let me ask you this um what if\nHe doesn't change the constitution per se for this birthright citizenship but is there a way to put certain restrictions on it right so that people don't like that then you know to to curtail the anchor baby situations\nThe purpose of the Supreme Court to interpret the constitution and the current available technological and\nUh understanding of reality you know scientific circumstance which we live the founding fathers never imagined people flying in bed having a baby flying out there just wasn't even you couldn't even imagine that so he's on this new phenomenon should there be guidelines\nI and I completely agree that I'm seeing I mean I'm On the front lines and I see what happens and the unfortunate thing is\nAnd this is people not I'm not saying everyone does this but a lot of people come and they take advantage of the system so they'll come they'll have a child who's a U.S citizen now that child is eligible for all public benefits because they're a U.S citizen right medic health\nFood stamps welfare that child's qualifies for all of that so that these people have three four kids now they're living off of public benefits\nHere in the United states which we're all paying for and it's a huge Fonda system so I I Do think that something needs to change whereas if you're going to come here if you're going to have a child here then you have to show that you're financially solvent enough\nWrites order to in order to do that so if you're going to have a child here\nDo what you can't do that we're not going to give the citizenship to your child or residency looking to hold it in a band until you're able to show that you could financially supporting\nHer for her it's reasonable appropriate to be able to do this and you know how the Supreme Court could handle is the big good look at the definition of citizen that doesn't that isn't that something to contribute or we\n... you know but we don't look at that and with our immigration policy marry\nSomebody lands on the property to rupture too it's like even though is\nStarting to cut you off but the but the problem is is we do look at that an immigration only time we do look at that is for kids so if you if I married someone from another country and I wanted to apply for them I have to submit the last three years of my taxes\nHow can they can actually support this person and they're not they're not going to become a burden on the U.S economy right for and while their residence\nThat I'm responsible for them for as long as residents before they become a citizen and before they can apply for citizenship if they're receiving public benefits or if they have overdue taxes that they haven't paid they're not going to get their citizenship but in order to petition somebody to come to the U. S. it doesn't matter who it is a sibling a child a parrot\nThe ... the petition or how to get a U.S citizen sponsor\nSo the the only time or not you end up sponsorship rules are so lax and they're not enforced right people that are receiving public benefits right but they practically could be an economic fall back on the sponsors of\nIce sponsors someone and they rack up twenty thousand thirty thousand dollars and medical bills technically that can follow me a monster never enforced\nInteresting what excuse me President Trump said that no other country has this policy is that true\nThough are\nVery few I mean Canada does some\nI think the u._k. does is well\nSome European countries do have that were born there or you know most of the middle eastern countries do not have this policy most African countries don't have this policy a lot of the Asian countries also don't have this policy I mean it I mean\nFor you do do the one that I Do have it like that you can't Canada or the as lax is ours\nI\nI don't know if there is locks as ours but they don't have the same chain migration issues right\nOut we have ... I mean and the problem is is I mean look you guys are a Los Angeles I'm In San\nDiego we are in a we're in immigration battleground territory essentially right but when you get congressmen from Nebraska in Iowa they don't really see these issues as much as we do down here it's it's a hard led us to look through because they just the big picture chain migration they don't see the little nuance ruled that everything that's happening\nOn the front lines unfortunately but it's\nIt's sad because there's it's hard to make policy if you're not actually seeing what's happening on a regular basis\nWhere do you imagine just to switch gears a little bit going to happen with the Margaret ... one of many depending on where\nI Am I on the U.S is going to just get held up at the border these people are going to be taken into the tension and the people that own these detention facilities are going to get extremely extremely wealthy off the federal\nGovernment already there is no that's that's how\nMean what they should do is what they could easily easily can do with resources and money they can it doesn't cost a lot to set up refugee camps on the southern border between Mexico and Guatemala and just stop them their screen them there and if they have a decent case\nFor recyclables early this morning according to Anaheim police sergeant Darren ...\nDiscovery body inside of me back some sort of a bag inside of the dumpster\nPolice say the reports that the woman's body was dismembered are wrong homicide detectives now reviewing footage from nearby surveillance cameras to try and have done a ... a suspect in the murder\nOf Boston mob boss James Whitey Bolger who spent sixteen years on the lam before being captured in Santa Monica and twenty eleven was found dead today and his cell in federal prison in West Virginia just one day after he was transferred from a prison and Florida Bolger was convicted in twenty Thirteen of participating\nA loving murders and was serving a life sentence\nI'm married to Indian cut off from the bay area who fell to their deaths from a popular overlook at Yosemite National park last week were apparently taking a selfie that's what the man's brother told the Associated Press today their bodies were recovered about eight hundred feet below tapped point which does not have a railing\nA woman who went on a one day crime spree and whether you're in la mirada\nIn the last year she was sentenced to three hundred and fifty years in prison today or last month twenty seven year old a random Gomez was convicted of murder carjacking and fourteen counts of attempted murder\nMeanwhile the twenty two year old female accomplices still awaiting trial in similar charges\nPresident Trump wants to end the constitutional right to citizenship for babies of non citizens in illegal immigrants who are born in the United states the president tells ... on HBO he wants to end the birthright citizenship which is included in the fourteenth amendment and do it by executive order\nOf ... with the only country in the world where a person comes and hasn't baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous\nThat move though would spark a court battle over the president's authority to unilaterally change the constitution\nAnd there was a free dental clinic for children today in Hollywood it runs till eighth thirty tonight at the ... community center a fifty two oh five Melrose Avenue Dennis will clean kids' teeth and checked for cavities all also offer dental see what the kids seven to fourteen years old talk\nRadio seven night Kate ABC or flippers visit the Oklahoma City thunder five this afternoon duck Sosa Philadelphia Flyers at seven tonight that sports on seven Ninety KBC traffic a market check whether it more Dr Drew midday live ...

she admitted she lied about her educational background and frankly diploma\nBecause the school came out and explain that they don't even give a degree in what she claimed to have gotten to the woman degree and so here's her apology\nI Would like to apologize to my family and my supporters for this situation it was not my intent to deceive or mislead anyone I made a mistake and saying that I completed my degree\nWhat I did was wrong and sort of an example for someone speaking public service I'm staying in the race\nAnd into the wind and lead by example\nFrom now on from now on\nSo I Would say that at a press conference I Would raise my hand if he's taking questions in the question would be\nSo if it was not your intent to deceive or mislead what was your intent is that is that really

... ... not ... and and she was in I chicken ... even though her mother liquor rather than\nI can live there\nBut she was not given any citizenship in Japan even though that we obviously our country should show that yeah and so now that you know as Americans you\nKnow were born here many different you know ethnicities wages that you're safe but we are Americans 'cause me oh boy here so I don't know what else you want\nAll right let's get another bank or they're pretty sure that uh ... what do you say that as\nWell just too quick items are historically kitty Carrick got herself in trouble back when she was a banker and she interviewed the head of a hospital down in Texas and they were having a economic difficulties and he said they might even have to close because so many people who are coming across the border some of the\nWomen were still wet actually because obviously they're crossing the river but I was more interested in the Canadian situation where in front of parliament there's a bill that would obviously stop the birthright citizenship because they've had such an influx of the Asian uh\nWomen using this so I'm I it it's got to go through Congress but we got to get Democrats on board with this because I you know obviously it's it's seen as a good way to get people in here to vote\nYou know yeah I think everything is about political expediency and not about what's good for the state of good for people and you know for healthy economy and just a functioning society generally seems to be not a priority cat roads don't function sanitation doesn't function the immigration is a function\nYeah what what am I a minimum they learned it from the government\nOr the anarchists we just don't know the government officials want ... that the plan though what it sounds like you're right\nI mean this is why I Would fear a single payer as good as it sounds like you're going to throw healthcare on the on top of that for the government to deal with a\nWell your health care dollars will definitely be trusted over to a trained to know where you don't go to pay attention to their parents or your pension plans so ... yeah\nI could add to that they came out and said that Medicaid if you did it for everyone in California would be two hundred and eighty billion dollars are budget in California is right around one hundred and eighty billion so as far as paying for it [laughter] it doesn't look like\nThat could happen though is the way they conceive of it could not happened it just could not happen but but they maybe they could find ways to buy health\nCare that are efficient their options for people and you know considering multiple kinds of plans seemed like the rational thing to me and then one that include something that everyone can afford but you know of course you know I don't know why we don't have multiple options out there a Susan what are you sir\nOh hi I'm I Want to just say you know I'm from the bay area but I was in the front lines and probably Fifteen Years ago\nI Know he's saying is that it gives me the right to left is saying like oh they're trying to instill fear about immigrants because immigrants can't vote they're an easy scapegoat but they're beginning to vote we're giving them the right to vote especially in San Francisco now you can load I have an illegal immigrants so that's not true\nSo you know can I say thank you guys actually putting a spotlight on this cause low enough yet\nWell thank you already said that you got to think if they're going to show and a and also thanks to learn because this is your pet peeve of mine is home line number one year my mind is the factory will lie sick on the streets years is is this one and I'm I'm not far behind you on this or let's get a quick call from Ken go ahead
