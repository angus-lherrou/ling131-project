{"content": "There there's no options of um\nOf things that she sat on the record about it so I'm not sure what more an interview could have done um\nWell she was willing to hand over her notes from her therapy where she disclosed this incident as well as give her a lie detector test\nI mean the telegraph is garbage no matter no matter what it's garbage nobody wants a polygraph exam but the um the notes from the therapist\nUm is is a fresh I mean she was basically holding them hostage\nWell she's not alone I said I'll hand them over to the FBI when they interview me but they never interviewed her\nRight but I mean it's so she she setting preconditions for for the meeting she handed them over to the Washington Post so to say that she ... she she she's holding them hostage in order to get what she wants\nTo get what I wanted to she had an issue he's always asked for the FBI the interview with she didn't want to go in front of Congress until the FBI interviewed I mean this is the woman asking for more scrutiny not less on her story yeah so yeah I mean\nThey should have interviewed her yes but at the end of the day she gave sworn testimony to Congress\nAnd that I'm not sure how an hour and um I I\nWhat do you look let me ask you this what do you make of the you know there has been proved that he he most likely\nPerjured himself and describing his drinking habits as a teenager and as a freshman at Yale and the FBI was prohibited from looking into what his truthfulness about that account\nAnd I I don't think that he presented himself while he was quite expected that he did drink heavily he said that on the record\nThat he never drank where he wouldn't remember\nI mean a lot of it in a dispute that that's all\nRight but you don't understand his classmates don't do what he remembers and they also you're talking about something that happened so long ago who remembers the party from forty years ago or Thirty years ago\nThe ... or not do you do you when you were watching him his testimony did you feel that he was truthful\nYou his Ricky which I agree the rookie twenty five thirty years ago not a problem in pairs not cured it seemed like he was trying to cover it up you know can you comment on your perspective all of his temperament while he was trying to explain himself without the Africa was that drove him feeling like a victim of being a\nAwfully a cue from your perspective\nI mean I I I felt badly for him I felt like the whole the whole thing um\nDragged his name through the mud and um and he's really frustrated you spend an upstanding man for for everything that we've known about him um and he got drunk in high school\nAnd college he didn't um and that's basically what he's being he's being dragged through about um ...\nIt's it's if you were him though why did he seem reluctant to agree to an FBI investigation I mean if I was wrongly accused of something I Would beg for an FBI investigation\n[noise] I think he wants all of this stuff I mean he's been the subject of half a dozen FBI background checks before and it just got a point where I used to live protests only under oath and just had that\nIn his mind a witch hunt and in mind as well um it gets to the point where it's just I I'm I'm John\nAnd John throwing myself into the water being a false thinker sweat\nAnd you know be senators now I'm obviously the Democrats were going to vote for him anyway but the ones that were on the fence here um do you think that will come into play of of his truthfulness during his testimony that will sway their decision or do you think\nThey're confident that you know they were strictly weighing this issue of this allegation and that the FBI report seems clear that up to them\nI don't think anyone actually cares about these allegations right or left I think that people are going to vote for what their party um I I think that um I think that we have seen um how much everyone cares about sexual assault and sexual violence and um harassment I mean\nHeck out of Congress they they still they they're still paying hush money to people who are who leave their offices um I I don't think anybody cares I think it's all show and it's on it\nSo you don't think his truthfulness during that testimony is going to sway anyone the fact that we're we're nominating someone to the Supreme Court who who seem to be um invasive and uh at at the very least and and lying at the most during a sworn testimony\n[noise] I think that we're nominating someone who was frustrated about in cold is raped gang rape her on national on the national stage and he expressed that frustration but at the end of the day\nPeople are going to I'm going to vote with their party and there's no conscience and wash it off if there ever existed well\nI Would agree with heartedly you are you saying that you foresee a fluke Murkowski and colon voting for a confirmation\n[noise] so I it's hard to know um [noise] I I think that they don't even though I'm from what I've heard about flake recently um his Republican colleagues are still trying to twist his arm I'm\nCalling from Murkowski last I heard looked like they were going to vote for but I mean I think that we're not going to do until the boat itself but I think that um that Mitch McConnell is twisting a lot of arms behind the scenes to try to get this vote the way he wants it\nUsually ... McConnell calls for culture without knowing the vote total ...\nI think that mines are not totally made up but he's trying to just force this issue close because um because we've all had enough I I think everybody is I don't know because of an election annoy\nWell yeah but I mean one week isn't going to change the vote and and nothing is going to change that I think that um I think that it's just time to call though it or not but even if even if the vote is is against him next week they're still not enough time to nominate someone in and get them passed so the election\nIs not really I'm not really a consideration I think from a caught on that way\nBut don't you think this is it just like we were saying to rally the Republican basis is also rally the Democratic base as well you got you know protesters lining up now outside the capitals\n[laughter] yeah but I don't know if you can um I don't know if you can equate protesters with enthusiasm [noise] um\nI I haven't seen the numbers the fundraising numbers the way that I've seen from Republicans okay um I\nSo I mean maybe I'm just\nI'm just not hearing about it but um I I think we have tangible proof of Republican I'm sort of\nFrenzy about this I'm In the fundraising numbers on and then the polling numbers as well a special Adam and very but I haven't really seen that from the Democratic side but that might\nChange if if he is um if he is he goes\nThrough this weekend um then that might fire up the the left by I think I think we haven't really seen a fire yet\nBut any um I just have to ask you do you think the Republicans have a female problem\n[noise] um [noise]\nSo they they do but a lot of it is based on Trump um but what I'm hearing from Republican limit on this issue is that\nA Republican women are equally angry and myself included are very angry how cabinets and treated 'em so if anything I think that this issue is probably helping\nI'm helping Republicans with women and men um because this has been a unifying sort of\nUm experience for Republicans to the Kavanaugh smeared and the way that he has them\nThat's interesting I mean I was just even thinking just optical you know they had a female prosecutor come in to ask the questions because they didn't want the optics to be a bunch of\nYou know older white guys joining a an alleged assault victims so I that's how I was looking at it but um but you're right I mean Republican women overwhelmingly especially white women\nVoted for Trump and I think that that has this has not changed their votes\nSnow normally if anything it's probably galvanized more people like myself who didn't vote for Trump to to the Republican I'm from American side um 'cause I'm conservative but I didn't vote for Trump\nUm but this this I'm Still very fired up about this um and I've I've seen it a lot from other friends who are similarly I Trump skeptics but um but support Kavanaugh's nomination for his comment um confirmation\nBroken usually the Republican base value\nThe Supreme Court more so to the Democratic boos and this is why they can look the other way regarding from maybe some of his moral indiscretions foods\nThis guy doing something that we want we want to be a Supreme Court more than you respect of government seems to me the Republican put more as the union controlling the Supreme Court than any other branch of government\n[noise] um I I don't think that that people are overlooking something in order to nominate him I think that people think he's wrongly accused ... right I I don't think anyone thinks that this happened and it's okay um if you look at the example of Roy Moore in Alabama we currently have a democratic senator in Alabama because Republicans were not willing to look the other way\nUm and and there was a lot of conversation at the time and Alabama about the fact that\nIf he's not if he's not elected worry more than than that will that that could potentially I'm trying to scream court and it wasn't enough for Alabama Republicans and Alabama and voted for a Democrat and I think that um I I think that\nYesterday in Sacramento we released eight separate pieces of evidence\nVideos photos emails a show that they are actually using government money to campaign we have not filed complaints with a three separate county district attorney's the fair political practices commission announced that they have accepted the case that are now moving forward with their investigation\n... was a guest on mcentire in the morning ...
