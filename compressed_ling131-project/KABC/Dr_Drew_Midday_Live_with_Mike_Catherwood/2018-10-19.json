afternoon Happy Friday who\nYes dude and dates are so Facebook Facebook in their new stuff uh I guess once again fried privacy wasn't hired their list of concerns\nThough which\nShouldn't surprise us but it it it did in this instance this is the new portal and it's amazing that Facebook just can't get out ahead of this privacy issue thing here's another crack in this trust wall now\nBecause this new portal this home video chat device that was just lost a couple of weeks ago and when launched executives from Facebook were telling us reporters that among the things that it does not do as far as security measures that doesn't collect data well that was amazing we all thought we reported as such\nNow Facebook has walked that back a little bit\nUh quite a bit actually say it does collect data\nCertain court it doesn't look anything with a microphone in camera it's collecting stuff yeah and and we shouldn't do that\nBut I didn't even worries book anything from Facebook that we we get near is collecting stuff\nHow do you share server with\nAnything that's free were given up yeah yeah yeah yeah it\nAnd this is really the case and there are a lot of people now who do first of all there were people who didn't want this device in their home in the first place but they were told and and face ... executives are these other higher up Facebook executives are engineers are saying that those at Facebook who told us that it didn't collect data were misinformed\nOr so they're walking this back uh the the issue is the trust issue is the fact that Facebook now faces another cracking that trust wall that it just can't seem to patch up and there are many people who suggest that the best thing for them to do is stop skirting around this yeah I Would say\nStop at just tell us just let us know look yes we're collecting data here's what we're collecting here's our collecting it looked collecting and then here's what we're doing with it if they just came clean with that they're up front with it people wouldn't have that big of a problem there's an easier or a more informed choice we can make when we collect that except\nCan ... terms and conditions a tab or button so we can use the device\nSo it it it really boils down to that\nCreatures look I'm confused about Margaret tell us give give us some workers are\nJust got a lot more creepy when it it could follow you at no matter what angle whether you stood up on a couch or what he was crouched down on the floor and well it didn't just turn left or right it went up down all around it ... it just got it got way too you know creepy eyes picture\nWas stalking you stock and you know big brother started here but let me understand ... so you don't have to carry your phone around it it gets you across the room is that how that works yeah\nAs long as you're as long as you're in the room it it it follows you and and you can talk to and see the person on the other side they they have they have the other side of the device\nWhich I'm kind of confused and they can they can see you clearly like zoom in on you and stuff to\nA boy that's a great question um we didn't see that capability of it all we did was get closer a backup from it to see how it would follow us around I uh I I don't know that you can zoom in on somebody um it just it it's just a video chat device that's all it was supposed\nTo do and then they are not Instagram story or that kind of thing and it's just a sort of a video phone\nRight but you can you can also work apps that are upset that go with it I'm a you know that you could use from it when it's silent uh they give you a cover to cover it just so you don't freak out that there's cameras in your in your house you know but who's going to put the cat who's going to put the cover on it all the time you know\nYeah but it it it it it was a it was a cool idea it look great in its in its testing when we saw a and follow you around and you could talk to people\nAh it was a it was a great picture a nice nice sounding audio wasn't hard to hear so it was really neat until it started to stock you refer\nMarket it's really interesting though to me because it's so far off the sort of Facebook brand and it's like you said just a one to one or I'd be I'd be communication as opposed to platform for all I just\nI mean if it's fake tanning too much for people or whatever it is like if I Need something to follow me around the house so I don't have to sit in front of a screen that\nWell they they do a great marketing these things so you want to buy them you know are going on\nBut you're right like I said you're you're better off using and I've had to face time somebody if you need a bigger picture where you're walking around you have your phone I mean if you're at your house you're getting ready to go somewhere your video chatting with somebody better to do it on face time because then you could just go ahead and leave getting your car to continue on\nAnd still have this

counterterrorism consultant who have on\nWhat was the downside that you have people pulling out of the middle eastern down the economic ...\nUnderstand what the question is the downside for the Saudi family or for Saudi Arabia for side right okay got it\nRight you have a people pulling out of this Economic Forum you have major companies deciding not to do business with Saudi Arabia I Can't imagine going to make a huge economic impact but one of the reasons that\nUh and the ... the prince was thought of as a reformer and definitely trying to um act like he was making reforms in Saudi Arabia was to lure a finance or to to Riyadh for this conference at the fact that they are all pulling out now\nDo you think they feel like they shot himself in a fight or that this will just go away like so many of the other cases that\nOr is the downside again in or the upside are downside invisible to us because what was what this was in response to we're we're not aware of\n[noise] well and you have to keep in mind that that uh this doesn't just impact Saudi Arabia or listened to impacts the entire region there's a lot of moving parts going on in the middle east right now\nCertainly a turkey a cutter or or not uh allies at all of Saudi Arabia or there or\nOther issues involving the relationship between the United states of the Gulf Gulf countries so there's a whole lot of moving parts here and\nThis this simply doesn't impact only the Saudis are certainly the ... or have a a keen interest in what happens because Saudi Arabia is is one of their\nIs out there for most uh uh certainly alongside the United states one of their greatest allies so\nSo there's a lot of uh there's a lot of things that this impacts\nYou you are a a former CIA you're kind of terrorism consultant people seem to think that this is all come down to ... because he heard the president said we have a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal that we do not want to lose over one incident but it really comes down to more than that I mean when you talk about rendition\nThings like that the Saudis obviously are willing to get their hands dirty in ways that we are and and we do take advantage of that don't we\n[noise] well I guess you know from the standpoint of a of of our own national interests and that you know we we certainly have to\nUh you know we have allies of that that uh that we I guess in a sense we have a um\nI don't know of tolerance is the is the correct word but a um we have allies across the world and other other regions and that that you know that sometimes don't I'm a don't act the way that we would prefer a soda say\nTalking about or maybe even as far as human rights just I'm Talking about it you know if we need someone tortured because we need answers we can't do it perhaps but maybe they can and maybe they can help us out that way\nEnemy of my enemy is my friend\nWell yeah I mean they can not get their hands dirty in ways that we can because we're America and we don't do that but but they do um if does that come into play here along with all of the economic ties we seem to have\nYou know because\nWe're not even though you know you know the the type of behavior that type of activity as is something that ah that's something that the United states won't engage in how we also will not a support that type of activity being done on our behalf\nOh one thing it's against the law no and\nI'm like a wink wink nod nod situation [laughter] [noise] no I mean I Know when you own ... okay I I get on an antibiotic and Ridgway how\nCan you give us your sensibility about this is our del Wilber former CIA counterterrorism consultant I still feel I I Know you're waiting for the facts and we all are but your guard does your gut tell you anything about what's going on here\nWell I mean I have an opinion just like just like anybody else I'd love to hear it I Would love to hear you know you\nKnow I had my opinion is as I mentioned earlier a in our conversation about the risk and gain or my opinion is is that that uh this wasn't intentional whatever happened if in fact this\nThis individual is dead I'm his death was not intentional or whether that means that you know he he when he arrived at the consulate in was met by the\nThe the Saudi or a officials are that he you know ... perhaps a panic resisted fought whatever I mean he could have suffered a heart attack for credit allowed the guy was not you know the picture of health and uh and it was that that uh you know I think it was in his sixties I remember right but uh\nUh so it certainly could have been a situation where they they intended to interrogate him maybe roughly up a little bit I don't know and in the course of that he\nYou know succumb to to injuries or to a a natural cause and then it's like holy cow what do we do now you know I mean are we really don't know yet but that's that's kind of\n... that that makes it so that makes sense that I I I I I appreciate that that interpretation because it makes sense\nBecause you know like you're saying is that why would they do this then of course there are plenty of other journalists they were I mean they would do so much bad stuff all the time if they went around killing journalists that was their thing but you either have something else going on big that we don't know about or this is the snake\nThis this went bad somewhat terrible\nI yeah I mean and I'm certainly not justifying you know any any individual or anything like that but I don't know they\nSeem to have everything they needed on the scene there if in fact we are to believe they sell so called audio tape that they be headed hand and cut off your fingers I mean even if it's an interrogation gone completely wrong to have a ... year they'll seem awfully convenient\nWell again though we're getting you know unless there is no something that I missed we're getting that information from turkey and the Turks are are certainly not someone\nThat I wasn't it wasn't yeah\nYes in in in in most capacities I mean they're certainly not reliable or our allies as far as I'm concerned\nOkay so that that all sounds that that's starting to come into focus a little bit there for me now given that they're the Saudis or find themselves in that situation whether in time for your otherwise what did they do ah it it seems like they need to do something as big you know is allowed to compensate for any theories of what they do see\nYou know it's a it's a toss up really I mean it's anybody's guess a by my suspicion is that they are they're going to they're going to have to\nTo ah give us some information about what happened then again I gave you might theory that that it was on a catch it all and uh I think that they they may come out with something like that\nOr and they may punish the crown prince or it may be something\nUh where he is out of the public eye for a while you know kind of a let's let this thing died down and uh so we restrict his uh you know his movements restrict his his public uh uh image or whatever that image but his his his public appearances of that and it kind of\nA um you know put him back in the shadows for awhile let things die down and then uh you know maybe a year from now or or whatever uh you know things are a he starts repairing or something I I don't know I mean it's anybody's guess but it's it is certainly as we all do a a very a a\nTouchy situation or both or politically as a for the region the Gulf region as well as er here in this country\nWhat if there were to Florida theory would if they were to mix or grand sweeping diplomatic gesture red light and recognize Israel or get involved\nIn something row area what are your whole areas but what you know what if they were ... or ... or any ... any chance or something like that happening\nYou know I I don't see anything like that happening I think if anything they're gonna they're gonna drag this out as long as they can as far as uh you know finally releasing a reporter or whatever because uh the further away it gets from a you know what is it what are we in two to three weeks now uh\nYou know the the tension span of most people are you know starts to uh to move on to other things so I think it might be part of their strategy in it as I said they may you know a a release report again claiming that his death was inadvertent was accidental\nAnd um you know that uh you know they uh you know mistakes were made and and how they handle that or something but\nOur rights an ability to vote is critical and to allow an agency that is so troubled now they have many other issues to deal with and this is not one that should be a priority\nNeal since and the process to implement the legislation could take up to a

bay area Republican survive and in response to act like a Democrat right now though we're going to go out to de ... former chief of the Georgia legislator black caucus do up in the program\n[noise] yes hello thank you so much for having me today\nSo one of the things we're looking at was the California revisiting the three strikes life sentences what is it issue here\nWell take issues you have about four thousand citizens in California that could be impacted by this particular proposition because as you know two years ago California voters that sixty five percent with proposition fifty seven voted to allow uh those who are incarcerated for nine out of them is\nTo be released early parole or if they fit fit the criteria\nThat the problem with that and a proposition forty seven is the voters feel in this state\nLike they were do because we didn't understand what was going to be included in non violent offenses including things like kidnapping and beating your wife for killing you know being a child is kind of unconscious for raping unconscious person all became non violent offenses and so the state at large just sort of ...\nWar or a good job that we didn't mean that but that's what we got\n... yeah it's just so that goes back into the classification so people have to be very careful when they're voting for love and even how they're classified um injure state system and so what will happen to build the parole board still has the discretion to look at those cases and determine whether or not they should be really\nWell they've been very liberal and their to their trust me they they'd be the way they describe to a lot of his leading yes they've been quite quite a ... of the application of the of the new law but\nI don't understand the it says non violent third strike are are disproportionately black disproportionately mentally ill and typically among the least likely to commit additional crimes now how can they be the least likely can connect additional crimes if their third strikers already\nBecause these crimes are drug offenses um and it's usually ... of marijuana or stealing a bicycle stealing money out of a car stealing so they could be as simple as stealing five dollars and change out of a parked car so why are we will say\nUm their offenses candlelight crimes\nPetty crimes even though all crammed as bad if they're both of them are paid to quit\nBut they are I mean it's fair to say that they are more likely to re committed petty\nCrimes unravel the previous cannabis offenses seems to me that those are the problems that go right ahead I mean yeah and that's\nProbably what they should have done but what I'm going to say is usually when people make crimes like that and they've served time significant time Fernando Valley clan crimes the way to refer the recidivism is kind of low it's not as high people were thinking is is usually only between\nFive and ... percent that people will actually go back and a little never knew crime based on serving time\nIn prison because prison sometimes make you do write well you know this\nIs after serving a non violent crime\n... so what is California likely to do in any opinion about what what what's likely to happen here\nWell you know I was talking to one of my good friends today who's out in California my gifts and we were talking about um the legislature maybe going back in and trying to rewrite some some codes because we know that it is a problem if people are going to be released um\nWhen they've been classified the wrong way but at the same token we have to make sure that we get a handle on mastering constellation especially for non violent class because look at California California right now has a with a hundred and twenty thousand people incarcerated was about three thousand and those\nWere not classified the wrong way those those really are non ballot cracked down\nThat's their self I enjoyed his progressive and many issues that they still further behind

Santa Anna's in low humidity as well National Weather service had originally issued a fire whether watch for today and tomorrow but yesterday upgraded to a red flag warning\nSort of Soviet style governing or we can try more market oriented solutions that have worked that's where I'm pro government as tacking tackling the challenges that we're facing\nThat's what I look for and you know pro environment was a long time Republican heritage going back all the way to Teddy Roosevelt a next and started the environmental protection agency it was actually governor Reagan's you started the first emissions waivers to make sure we had strict admission standards in California and bipartisan governors\nAnd we're also Republican governors who are working to protect our offshore coast from oil drilling that is what I've been about all this tournament fighting for the environment in California so I don't think it has to be a partisan issue\nOf of course none of these things have to report on I'm happy if you could focus on what I I Would have been a new party called the pragmatism party at a pragmatic party the ... part part of that helps people job done party party\nIn California and especially that we have that far right a friend that once you up and\nYou know all federal regulations they want it to be things right they don't want to follow immigration laws they don't want I ... the writer member ice is a far less for low skill anymore yeah and where do you stand on that whole issue with the sanctuary stay and going up against multiple off you know the federal government\nLook I'll tell you right now that in Sacramento the super majority has really got very far to the extreme left and even some of my most a longtime Democrat\nBeck constituent say the same thing and and the ... state is one of those examples you can be very embracing of immigration a welcoming policy towards immigration just like Ronald Reagan had but if people are breaking the law whether they're victimizing Californians who are citizens or not or however they got here you're breaking the law\nWe shouldn't be putting up barriers between law enforcement brain able to keep us safe and that to me I\nI hear literally how we got in ... yeah yeah and\nAt the same time though I mean I think you'll find it an embrace of immigration and California and certainly in my district\nIncluding refugees from other countries and if you listen to Ronald Reagan shining city on the hill speech is very last address to the nation that's what that was all about so again um you look for what is that right balance and how you approach policies and I I Will say when you got a super majority in Sacramento that never has to talk to the other side you end up with those extreme policy\n[noise] I I don't understand why we can have a conversation about legal versus Shiite we're not even allowing\nNot even allowed to say the word\nWell you know I I think it starts from where is it good use of our ... a public safety dollars we have a limited amount of public safety dollars the poor use of time to go running around trying to round people up who otherwise honorably living here we should be uniting and focusing on how can we keep those our community safe\nFrom anyone who's committing crimes regardless of how you got here\nAt you know if you're a a five generation Republican or Democrat California if you're breaking the law I watch our streets and that should be the common sense way of looking at this regardless of what your immigration status is how can we allow law enforcement to do their job and unfortunately was coming out of Sacramento is going to the opposite\n[laughter] it's not a very victims centered approach it's not a very public safety approach it just the opposite that's why you need people who are willing to be independent from that\nAlso had voters we feel that do do you know with the ... ... ... and a half now has to rising crime they've caused all sorts of problems were letting people out of the jails um we're letting people you know in California and giving them benefits that even taxpayers don't have\nA so we we really feel like we can't even trust the politicians that are putting the stuff out there because it's full of things that we definitely didn't want but didn't know any better when Ronald ...\nIt's all it's sold is something that sounds just wonderful magical like were suddenly going to make sure that a crime is not going to be happening to you again but when you really look at what\nA lot of these propositions that done it's decriminalized what um tends to be the kind that we sail over neighborhoods we've seen double digit increases in my district and property crimes and fast and break and you know you go to San Francisco and people are writing on their cars please don't break into my car there's nothing there and I can't afford to keep repairing it and so that's an extreme\nI give you another one there was a bill that just passed and the governor signed it unfortunately that ends a felony murder law in California and retroactively now we're going to be having to re sentence people who participated in\nCrimes where somebody died and\nTo me that is not what California needs to be focusing on\nThat comes about because of the very big extremism at the at the state level you just need folks that are willing to listen to any good idea and not go to the extremes\n... you know we've we've been down like you're making so much heck I'm waiting for the heck here [laughter]\n... [laughter] so\nI actually disagree with you there because I have the bipartisan record I have an estimate Republicans have terrific ideas about how we can make the state more affordable and more prosperous and\nPeople have better lives my democratic colleagues occasionally have some good ideas as well if you're just going to focus on the labels you're not going to get very good work done because I have that approach I've got\nThe most bipartisan record of any assembly member in the legislature just in my first term\nMy bills get signed by the governor I'm able to be at the table when you're actually making decision making because folks are ... you're going to listen to the idea is you don't have blinders on I think we need more of that and Sacramento is listening it does mean I Will tell you this right now that a whole world of hack comes down on you and your election cycle\nBecause you disrupt what's happening in Sacramento and that's what's happened it up and my assembly district\nWould explain about what you mean\nOh well this is a um you know I go and I learn new things about me every time I go to the mailbox this\nTime of our our our yeah he\nIs so critical to that two thirds super majority for another decade and um and that kind of balance you know when you're the only Republican within two hundred miles of downtown San Francisco that brings a lot of attention from the other side he would rather have the seat and\nUh I'm just proud to be fighting for what my constituents would like to get done that it's that get that job done party [laughter] and I think that's important\nAnd a cat I'm bigger what do your constituents saying the number one thing they want to get done there and the sixteenth district\nSo uh it's it's all the areas that I think probably apply across the state police focus on what will affect the quality of life in my area of like my kids to have a good classroom good teachers good principles a good environment in which to learn so they can have opportunity regardless of\nYour family background your economic backgrounds so education they want if they want to see those doors of opportunity open for their kids they want to be able to have a commute\nTo and from work but that doesn't you know cause heartburn all day long they'd like to see solutions about that and really would like to see the cost of living in the state of California addressed\nIt seems like every solution that comes from Sacramento is how can we be taxing you more and spending more in order to address every problem when we really need to be more disciplined and they just want that they're not interested in can you be more Democrat\nCan you be more Republican I I'm In\nFact they turn away from that uh and it's important you know I'll tell you I've done twenty town halls\nWith members of the other side of the aisle sixteen with my overlapping state senators the plays or a Democrat\nI've done town halls with a democratic congressman and other democratic assembly numbers and at the end of those constituents will come up to us whether you're someone who is a lifelong Republican or a lifelong Democrat and they'll say I'm just glad you're working together 'cause I'm sick of the decorating and um that's one of the choices that my constituents will have on the ballot weeks\nAre can you explain something to me can you explain bickering driving the train for training session going ... miles an hour ... from grade I mean how we spent so much money for knocking out about that yeah I did that how do we get here and why only California\nWell you know it actually it wraps up a whole bunch of theme so it was sold as a bag of chips to California that it's only going to cost you know thirty billion dollars private money is going to come and invest everyone's going to have this two hour trip to hour and forty one minute trip from LA to San Francisco and will be done by now\nTwenty minutes off you're right there ... why do I need that are making fifty five minutes in an airport ... why do I need betray well look you know what I Would love the way I'm going to fly him I'm going to fly my drone there that are climbing through because of their own room to get around Los Angeles is worth while you're drunk so I'm going to be flying drones\nAnd why do we were we doing this\nWell look we're doing this because it's a project that one side of the aisle fervently wants to have and commonsense folks like myself say look you're throwing money at something that uh the head of the high speed rail authority came to testify that he has NO PLAN for how to complete this project and then the U.S already that said in testimony to us\nThere is no way it can be the promise high speed rail\nAnd so this is a perfect example of how leaders can even dig their heels in and just blindly keep following which is what's been happening in Sacramento on partisan lines or you can\nSpeak some truth about it which is we need to we need to end it reinvest those dollars into real transportation\nWater storage which actually benefits all of California or how about we not spend it and go into the debt that comes from that so what you're going to need more people who are willing to stand up for that in high speed rail is probably one of the best examples of how partisan blinders will just make you follow instead of good policy\nBut what what it looks like a boondoggle it looks like somebody's ... somebody got a bunch of money just pocket it looks like the convince me that it isn't\nI I mean we could all fly I G I care for them and I have our own to right now learn how to drive our own [laughter]\nYeah you're asking the wrong person to try to convince you that high speed rail is good I actually taught my twins my young kids what the word boondoggle is by using high speed rail isn't\nIt [laughter] and we're also I don't go and do it and everything and they were good policy but\nThere there are better things we can do and that's you just need more people willing to to stand up for that and and it does mean voting against your party\nAttacked by democratic colleagues need to be willing to vote differently against their party on this issue if we ever want to see it go let\nHaving them barricaded or even padlocked a series of escalating fines for their employees and having their utility service shut
