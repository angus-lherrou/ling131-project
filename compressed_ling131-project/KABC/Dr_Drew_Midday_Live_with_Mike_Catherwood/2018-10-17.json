really actually was a there aren't orange groves and so once they parsed data and and really got to a an honest assessment of it you can see that this was just a horrible idea and\nSo they have

and that's not just the thing that\nThat's actually um stated in the LA DOT complete streets manual that streets with lots of driveways actor's point or not an ideal candidates were protected\nAnd

do you know are you\nA abolishing nicer you for sanctuary cities these are issues of some in court in your state you tell us\nWorks beautifully in California just you know it's for a while I\nYou just think are out there there's got to be with the tax and everything else I think\nIn some of the extreme positions by the Democratic nominee and others that I'm getting this sense something could happen in California maybe\nNot I mean that if we do we start believing that things aren't happening here frankly because it's it's getting bad but where do they mean\nSomething can happen in California well\nLet the expectations could be upset that you know I I Lived out there during the recall died down I live out there now but I did there and then I predicted the recall actually right after the uh the weekend I'm\nAll right after the uh uh uh um oh six to watch the there was going to be one and if they are\nIt cause I looked at this ban and said look how badly Davis had done and then you have the car thing and so forth but I'm just saying that seems to me that the left him particularly alleged it's gone so far out there on stuff\nYeah ... ... ... ... well the question isn't all that kind of an rollers\nHuh yes when did that you don't have to go to the right or you got to do is go back to the middle right wing mainstream and and that is what that is a story nationally because you have\n... as I said you can teach them the questions they mean to disrupt the country people think that will damage the economy there you've got the same the other two big issues or immigration as I started to say a is a big one\nWell let me give out that he couldn't have talent fine yeah that's one of the doubt pitching at a law suit against the federal government over immigration calling your town for sanctuary fate pitching along through their executing ... yeah I'm ... is that what you mean when you're talking about going so far out to the laugh that\nWell I I Am yes that's what I'm saying I mean do people say that people think that there look we did a poll and I I mean I had some input in some and I asked the question are\nThere things that the point that was testing on trumpet base which is you know it's like a twenty five point margin yes including many Democrats who said Democrats are more concerned with the with them with illegal illegal immigrants than they were with the rights of American\nSo that oh listen in California yeah we've been saying for quite some time had a client or with the same quite some time if you are not just illegal or a documentary on if you're if you're a\nCriminal undocumented we we got you covered we will give you food will give you a housing we'll make sure you're protected taxpayer screw you man screw you\nYeah yeah well that you as a I think is um is plenty evidence and as I said I'm not aware but I'll tell you a nationally and I'm looking at regions this is what's type event that in the idea that this democratic socialism\nOr is leading Democrats or abandoned the center to go to socialism to they're going to repeal everything that Trump is done or try to stop it tracks on the economy and so forth at this upset at least you know a good number of Democrats and most independents ... question\nIs whether the Republican Party will galvanize itself to town or a national campaign which is the implicit anti Trump campaign when a national campaign that goes everywhere and says the same message which is\nThat you know these are the issues you want to go back the chaos or someone said to me you know ... jobs versus mobs um\nYou you want look we had incidents yesterday two candidates and Minnesota were attacked over the weekend physically Republican candidates [noise] your had other people calling out for you know like Maxine Waters for um you know attack every Trump person you can find\nThis thing about instability in dress nice and had numbers on it yesterday over you know it was quite decisively defeated\nThe proposition that Hillary Clinton made even though it didn't name her that the you know we can't have civility Democrats with and in fact people thought up the Democrats won the house overwhelmingly they lead instability will get worse instability\nWell you know what that is now an issue but I I I in Trumbull at the incompetence of the Republicans\nAre all the way it would be the biggest problem the Republicans have and I are right in the middle just sort of looking at both sides of disbelief personally [noise]\nBut uh that they if somebody identifies with that party they're considered by the other side to be a racist period\nThey're supporting racist causes they are racist it to their core and everything about them and everything they support them and then they represent is racist and sexist period end of story they need to address that they've never heard anybody talk about that\nYeah yeah well I think so I mean they they are allowing themselves to be put in that box and a lot of the um you know the economy has not been doing what they hoped um it would do um\nThe um um [noise]\nIn terms of moving boaters ... although it is\nWell they they have a a metric trumped gotten away of that by putting a bunch of sanctions over the place to to to play a longer day out in the meantime politicians getting undermined right right right\nAnd and that and it's been a I'm I'm a you know I think a a um a a problem all up and down\nBut the but but I mean they haven't been able to benefit in the African American and Hispanic community with how well the economy is going for them which\nIt and they will need point right\nAnd they shouldn't be doing that they failed to do that that's why I said get out of the message is now but work\nRelated to the economy as you want to undo this economy and the job so all the just the Democrats and they've made an argument that they will repeal the entire program on this work economically\nAnd I'm a and therefore you know they have a radical idea which is the you know I'm you know the Democratic socialism and as I said half the Democratic party doesn't want this\nSo the question is saying the band in the center and can the Republicans are recalibrate they are trying to do it locally I think they have to do more but actually that puts everything in to play or we're just we're already seeing the effect in the Senate races\nWhich is hurting the Democrats cause for taking our late because of the map but in the house it's a it's still an open question and in California it's critical\nI think I hear you saying that the states that the populations were blue we're just going more blue\nAnd feeling more self righteous and the people that were sort of read or even like red or feeling attacked and undermine and scared and and ... more more [laughter] so we're just sort of for both sides are moving to the extremes\nYes well that is that the the one for the what I'm Talking about the marginal races or it's not you don't have to go to the extreme you just have to go and say here are the choices\nAnd I believe that this kind of consequences that so we made that they focus on Trump needs to stop talking about being an election about twenty sixteen and many ways and I told him that he was the beneficiary\nHe was he didn't named ... it was self generate ... and he needs to deal with the same idea not about him it's about the country\nAnd I hate to say the one that that would be it\nWhen you're talking about a Republican not doing enough messaging to get the minorities out there running for him despite the economy if you look at Trump's messaging female who his base and he knows he's going to vote for him and he had a lot of mine had Morrie I mean\nYou ... well this is going to the U.S I think you know and he thinks he isn't that China\nYeah I mean wind then I have is I mean if you're an eye on him\nHe'd go hey Conyers them [laughter] I think that's where he'd say but go ahead John\nYeah well I mean I think that is a problem and I think that you know when he said so and so it's\nFor fans of the things the trees and everything will be going for it and you're waiting for that and we will have

programs state of California's been moving it on this and now a year county has as well what is it that we are getting after here we have\nAll the laws on a coastal city to go halfway house at the ...

heritage\nAnd everyone else is not entitled to call themselves of this ethnicity not entitled to call themselves as such we learned that and that was interesting and it brought up the whole

happens during the midterms in November he ever had\nA well I think that no matter what it's just going to be absolute political chaos\nLike at the at the most I think what happens it could have happened as the Democrats are going to take back the house and that it's just going to be a repeat of what happened in two thousand I tend when the Republicans took back the house and it just made an even more crazy\nIt may may it may however I I started thinking she says if I were Donald Trump what I Would do is I Would start going out stuff that the Democrats what health care infrastructure and inside up with them on things that they've been keep talking about go let's go do it let's go do that and\nThat would be a lot of sense to me too but in the very unlikely set or have a very likely instance at least in my opinion if let's say the Republicans retain control both houses it's just going to be the same like this is going to be the same past two years all over again\nBut in a weird way could be I I but what I had that thought ... I don't disagree with you it's certainly possible both both scenarios are quite possible but when I started thinking about ... guy says he's a dealmaker Trump says he's dealmaker he started out to start making deals around health care and infrastructure if he really wants to make a difference\nI think that's exactly it out and I guess what if you had all Republicans in there you'd have more difficulty because they don't wanna spend any money the Democrats are you know it's going to healthcare\nWe've we've somebody that before it's interesting I was on I'm going to be a better during a paddle and political and Southern California and they were estimate that Medicare for all costs like ... trillion dollar oh yeah we don't we did not have had a we don't have it so something else got to be done so I don't know why\nNo one wants to reach across the aisle no\nBaby the baby more blue will help them build that the eight hundred to two to five to ... to ... is our phone number is ... this is they live [noise]\n\nIs six nine new history of the national key word and nice five eight one\nOr your shot guns dollars\nWell just just didn't want to know\nAnd how much\nMore on the Los Angeles Orange County cumulus station\nCBC News uh live and the local that through o'clock I'm Rob ... fell a few police are reporting an increase in the number of homeless murder victims\nThe homeless account for less than one percent of the city's population however make up about sixteen percent of all homicide victims of this year Colleen Murphy is with the Los Angeles homeless services authority\nHer her journey as a as a military spouse and and celebrating her as the maker\nFor all the benefits and the military essentially right if you're if you're with the ... hills right family I've had yeah directly helping rape\nAnd re to one third of every dollar actually spent it all goes directly back to the hands of a military family and we're doing that through creating them opportunities here in America and um and just last year we we provided income opportunities to over a hundred military families\nHuh incredible I Need to improve your PR a little bit I I didn't actually get what you need to do to buy these things they needs to be one thing I Would say you know a little more clearly if you want to buy something right now go to\nOur weather dot com are either ... or whatever that are are riveter\nYep correct are riveter dot\nCom or one of our our rivers that are are in spelled ...\nSo our period riveter is the name of the company but there is no period and the website to R.

race you believe that that's\nWhat I thought we'd gorge today but I I I'm ... it's ... isn't it weird how was the boring things just gone today I thought we'd be talking about that from I thought would generate lots of interesting tributary\nAccomplished so much news overnight you add the ah veal O'Rourke and that Ted Cruz debates right do you watch that you had to sort of highlights um you had\nYou can see I mean you have the the new gruesome details about what happened journalists yeah and um and you have and you have Trump or responding to a standing up for his horse say\nWell that's the part I Want to get into you ah what do we do a about Mr Trump and his rhetorical flares uh what\nDo we tell her kid had a night away very general we how do we manage this what do you tell the first lady\nWho's out there trying to combat the way she has her husband going another woman or the\n... but he again her status more he does have something more her stock goes up right 'cause she's

what has us all spinning out of control\nI Know and it's because it's so on presidential yeah right I mean what do you weigh supportive policies or not is not something that we can all be proud of that ... year the president of our country speak like\nThat and yet weirdly and this was a part of the people were calling me about it feels like the people that push him in office that were so disenfranchised feeling unhappy for the government failed them kind of wanted to a wrecking\nBall as I Do appreciate the that candid enough but even the people that want a wrecking ball I'm not sure they would show how this was a man right my\nProblem with it when you have really um you're faced with you know the gruesome horror of what more than likely happen to that journalist Jamal 'cause she'll be right but you have the president kind of reserving judgment in protecting the Saudis instead of really using harsh language against them if they did this really\nWhat I wanted to do that and yet he reason for them to maybe a reason why you know way harsher language discussing Muller discussing young cabinet sometimes yes yeah oh for sure for Jeff Sessions says if his way worse than the
