we've seen also when it comes to Russia\nAnd the president can have a different response obviously Congress controls the purse strings um and there's a so number one you know the president has been saying that there's like a hundred and ten billion dollars tied up into a\nArms purchases from Saudi Arabia but only fourteen billion or so of that is actually signed and\nAnd ready to go we could put a halt to some of that but at the same time you know even when he talked about Yemen and what's horrible going on there there's a larger context which is between Iran trying to take over the middle east which is is fueling the war\nIn Yemen and it was also obviously responsible for keeping\nAssad in power and is essentially in control of Lebanon and so this is\nCause the Sunni powers in the middle east basically the Gulf kingdom and Saudi Arabia Egypt Jordan\nUh to be very much against that so if we weaken Saudi Arabia venue strength in a Iran on the other side which is the catch twenty two of our foreign policy in the middle east in general well while we've been in Syria\nAttacking to destroy ISIS that benefits the wrong but if you just go after Iran you benefit ISIS\nYou could say that we could we destabilize the middle east with the two thousand one war which changed configuration political leadership there and it seems to me than we are keeping the Saudi Government the monarchy\nA propped up for what reason I don't understand it we're putting a value system on these a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of\nArms over moral or are so so called moral\nDignity to protect human life I just I just find as as a equal equation if it doesn't make any sense I just don't understand how we are so in in debt it to the Saudis they need us more than we need them\nAnd you take away the jets you take away the just the only thing they have is oil and we're no longer a oil dependence nation we're exporting are exporting oil as much as any other country so I don't get it I just wish somebody can just tell me what am I ... you know like there's something else there's something going on here\nThey weren't my team of their individual more involved in nine eleven they they had their people ... phone out of this country and there was a nine eleven commission reports have never been released after their involvement and they were able to to to keep the pressure on this government not to release that to the American public\nHold her family through both Republican and some of both Republicans and Democrats hundred percent correct and the American public has a right to know obviously\nWhich is the ... and all of that is to say that that obviously yes as you say there's something to it it's not something that they have on us but it's\nFact is Saudi Arabia by individual geography is at the center of first of all the streets through the red sea so fast place falls a it's a geographic nightmare as far as uh as far as access to the Mediterranean through the red shade the canal Suez Canal\nThat forty five years ago and technology we we I mean come on that's when we\nCome on I mean they're still shipping lanes I mean the ... that's still a very heavily used shipping lane close to ... where a Malaysia where like most a\nShipment spicy go it's not a small consideration but still yes the overall point\nI think is that the U.S has bought is that the U.S\nHas decided that it is on the side of those are countries that are Sunni in the middle east and Arab that are wanting to reform their their societies and the fact is as bad as the kingdom is if it were to just fall\nJust to internal dynamics and then be taken over by actual ... hobby terrorists in other words the those that really are\nBehind supporting the al Qaida ideology then that would be worse and then if it were to instead of that fall to outside forces law Iran would love it more than anything else and of course I\nGot him like a delicate balance in that events and that ... that an incident like this could tip that balance if it gets enough attention and enough seems like it is\nI mean I'm just wondering what the motivation would be for for these reports to be true that we're hearing that as Saudi authorities are preparing to come forward and say that they did intact kill him through a an interrogation gone wrong and they're putting it and I'm Wondering what steps they would take to\nTo prevent ... excuse me take to shield um NBS not have been involved in it\nYeah I look there's there's no doubt that the United states or would have much preferred that none of this ever ever happened and\nOf course it's terrific and there's going to have to be a some form of American response weather but at the same time as you said they are going to have to balance what the long term\nInterest is in what they're trying to do to literally push Saudi Arabia away just to make a point now um and to push them either toward Russia or China or to\nBasically to not have them continue in a ... with the reform agenda which they have been pursuing of course down to the speed that we would like then I mean that's\nAnd Jeffrey's K ABC News\nCNN is reporting the Saudi

fourteen hundred drivers in the U.S and they've released their twenty Eighteen distracted driving America report\nAnd according to that report a significant percentage of respondents admitted to participating in dangerous distracting behavior while behind the wheel more than half fifty four percent surveyed said they've texted while behind the wheel and other staff\nOr to join us now at this

it's ... it's it's I Want to say funny\nBut it's interesting to me that we all know what we shouldn't be doing behind the wheel and yet we do it anyway and according to the survey we even admitted\nThat's right you know thirty nine percent of it\nDrivers that dot com study said they do know that they're using their phone more than they probably should but they still fessed up to it as you said those texting stats or or you know off the charts Seventy three percent reading texts\nFifty four percent said they're typing text behind the wheel um so you know this really shows that people are a little addicted to their phones they just they can't put it down even when they're in the\nCar well if you live in California you spend so much time in your car sitting in traffic I'm not surprised but um this study will actually make the argument that distracted driving or texting while driving is actually a worse problem in America than drunk driving\nIt can be I mean we really can't make that argument that distracted driving is on the rise and we took a look at some pretty ... you know destructive behaviors things like\nWatching video while driving I mean I I don't know how you could do that but eight percent of the respondents said that they're watching Youtube videos for percent said they're watching Netflix programming while they're driving\nAnd you can argue yeah maybe they're stuck in traffic and they're just bored but you know the reality is if you get into that kind of behavior it becomes a pattern all of a sudden you're going to continue doing it when you are moving and when you pick up speed and all of a sudden something happens\nYou know a motorcycle or a bike pulls out in front of you in and you're still looking down at your photo watching something on

couch Tuesday November ... election day be sure to be heard vote rumbling through seven Ninety KBC new\nWave that report the news on it's pretty funny as hell\nIn the CBC [noise]\nWasn't backed him midday live I'm Lawrence of on Dr did got the day off\nAh in his seat is eat their mind and civil rights attorney ... at well as Julian Barbary jello it takes a village shake the very\nFact we'll be back\nTomorrow by the way a in the meantime we are talking to a Andrea K who is a political analyst um and a talk\nShow host and yeah I got that right okay excuse me and very there\n[laughter] yeah you got it right glad to be with you guys\nThanks for joining us so we now here from multiple sources that the Saudis are preparing to change their story on this missing journalist and will claim that he died during an interrogation that went wrong what does that say to you\n[noise] well I mean it says to me that they they prepare to finally you know tell us kind of what we already knew I mean we didn't really know the details none of us had heard that you know the I watch recordings but I mean did went in they didn't come out you have\nTo do it went in yeah Fifteen bad did winning behind them so I think we'd all kind of connected the dots and we weren't buying their story that gee we just don't know what happened we just went out the back door no no no no no so\nWe weren't buying it I don't I don't think anyone was but it seemed like President Trump was really taking the kingdom at their word that they had nothing to do\nWith it\nBut I didn't really I didn't really read President Trump that way I you know and in fact I heard multiple statements including west that Leslie stall as NATO sixty minutes where he said look they're saying they didn't do it\nWhere you know the the turkey is working with Saudi Arabia to try to figure out what happened and we I think we're going to find out what happened and there will be punishment ear punishment I think is the word to use if Saudi Arabia did this and you know I I take him at his word for that\nWere injured or take away the hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal ... tell me the severe punishment I watch the stolen review and we use the word severe punishment what can what a severe punishment if you take away the the arms deal and what ... what was it was his were severe punishment\nWell that's a good question you know um I you know typically economically is certainly how you end up putting the hurt on on these other countries I mean not to ... typically it's what brings people in line that typically as our greatest weapon because we don't really want to use the weapons of warfare if we ... you know unless we absolutely have to so I I predict that it will be economic\nRepercussions and it will put a herd on them and they they like money over there\nSo I think that they will certainly see that as punishment\nWell Donald Trump like money to do so I Wonder you know if you'll put his money where his mouth is we'll see what happens he does tend to sort of you know give the benefit of the doubt to big dictators but he did say last night in the interview I saw that clip 'em\nAnd but he always has to preface it by saying well we take it out as word you know like they will take him at his word until proven\nAnd I I Am Saudi Government themselves come out and say up you got us we did this interrogation gone wrong then we would have to take action now because he said so right when they and they admit that yeah\nYeah so he he absolutely set themselves up for the fact that he's gonna it it's going to be his red line in the sand so you know ... and I and I'm not really that at the time that he said that he knew that you know kind of what we all did that you\nKnow if it quacks like a ... to pick an analogy or a metaphor or whatever that are pretty clear that they did something here and I think they already knows what he's going to do about it he has prepared to do something\nSo that you know I and I think that those on the left that didn't have a problem with Saudi Arabia when they were given millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton are not going to be happy with anything that he does because you know everything's political these days so you know his detractors are going to find fault in a matter what\nAndrea hang on um we got a caller a rich richer it have a question for you Richard\n... ... it was in the kittens ... to ... to ... who says so\nThat doesn't the king of Saudi Arabia have the right to sending someone to death on his face out\nKilo ... king okay good question\nBefore Andrew
