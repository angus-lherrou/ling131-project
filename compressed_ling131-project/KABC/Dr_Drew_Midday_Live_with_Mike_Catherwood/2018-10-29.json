Jim welcome\nThank you so much good afternoon\nSo my question is who's who is funding in supplying this ... somebody is organizing an all the way across you can't move thousands of people across the continent star country without some organization\nWell according to vice president Mike Pence this caravan was organized by what he termed as leftist organizations not in the U.S and that it's being funded through Venezuela huh so that means ... is unclear at this point but\nJust for context purposes these are not uncommon these\nVia cruises as they call them these caravans um like once a year usually around holy week between palm Sunday and Easter Sunday\nTo draw attention to the poverty and violence\nIn Central America from what's called the northern triangle right the uh Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras so this happens a lot recently because of social media or they've been organized more and even cares the nail on the homeland security secretary says\nThey deal with these kind of numbers all the time like once a week they got Fifteen hundred people come into the border kind of huh\nWhen these things start wherever they're from wherever they started this one of Honduras another one began in El Salvador I Believe just a few days ago or so there are three total caravans on the way there the other two are smaller than the current large well between five and seven thousand\nSo we have this one caught our attention because of the size ... yeah and and the ending hundred a week who who do that\nThat's well that's what that's what she said on Fox News Sunday this week that they get these kind of numbers all the time well here's the thing by the time they get here\nThere won't be thousands there'll be hundreds because some of them will wind up staying in actual as you said this is a long arduous journey they've been walking for ... months now\nThey're still twenty two hundred miles from the\nTijuana border here so they have a long way to go even if they walked\nTwenty four seven I'd still take 'em a couple of weeks they took a rest on Sunday this larger caravan or in Mexico some ... some of them are accepting the refugee status and jobs in Mexico\nSo some are hurting some are in summer came back\nAs is the practice because they realize man this is really hard we're going back\nSo that happens to so by the time that care of and gets here\nI'm not saying there won't be thousands of people that there'll be a lot less than the current number according to the people in there is a ... in San Diego who helps provide legal services for them when they get here in shelters and things and they say you know there's usually cuts down a little bit are quite a bit actually when they get here so\nLet's California I think in other states are actually can do their job\nOr whatever whatever whatever the different laws are in the different ... yeah if it [noise] but uh so\nThat was a surprise to me too and she said that over the weekend I I was rolling tape on us I was actually able to go back and listen to say yeah she said she said these like Fifteen hundred these kinds of numbers every week so\nUm she called it a real crisis now whether she was accurate and that number or not that's you know my calls into border customs and border protection that have been returned yet uh that I made this morning but\nI don't understand what we're supposed to do I I'm confused by this story I just don't know what what we're what is our what I understand what the appropriate response is to this magical thing according\nTo its anyway the appropriate response when he experts would be those who ... can seek leak asylum should be given the opportunity to do so the others turned away\nBut what does that mean turned away when does that mean how do I do they have and that cat\nWe're not going to put them on a plane and send them back on doors right just you know sorry uh you you were\nClose you wander around the country that you're not going to end you're going to be here I'm told them\nThe same thing and they just keep wandering around their country ... how's it can be different here I guess\nRight well Mexico will have the big issue now there will be some who get through look let's face it there's there'll be some who are going to be able to get in the country illegally some will go through the legal process others will get through illegally it's it's it's a it's a long border and some of the areas don't have a wall or fence some of it's just\nMountains and trees and that kind of thing uh\nSo I understand these people are heading here and there obviously meaning horrific conditions otherwise they wouldn't take their children on this awful journey however when I you know thousands of people show up at your border and we really have NO PLAN of what we do and run\nThat or what more can be directly after ... yeah that's my question\nIs for for those guys\n... for the for the migrants themselves they're told that everything's going to be fine all they do a show up that we\nTake a shower and well they're a martyr but somebody you'd think somebody would go down there and give them the alternative position but

the\nProblem with street vending for me is your restaurant owner you're paying rent you pay a business license you pay occupancy permits you pay utilities you play employees you pay payroll sales tax you have to meet the city county state\nFederal labor health and income reports on liability insurance and then you've got a guy who wandered up in front of your store\nAnd opens a uh a stand a taco stand and doesn't have to do any of that he's got no cost it's a cash business or there's no income and sales taxes ... don't have to report it at all I'm Wondering if you're a I'm a business while you should have\nTo put up with that and by the way those people I don't think we want to be permitted as this point because uh again you're not showing taxes you're not showing\nYou know showing anything you can you can stuffed the money in your pocket and see you later all of a sudden if I apply for a a permit\nUm there's no way a first of all if I'm a legal I don't want to draw attention but second even if I Am legal ... street running generates a lot of unreported income so why would I pay for a permit\nThen forces me\nTo report my income or to pay taxes that's another one of those things that just doesn't make any sense to me and I love to hear from store owners are about this potential licensing of street vendors I mean city hall is trying to move that thing forward how would you enforce we don't have enough\nPolice we don't have enough to enforce what we have now how are you going to send people out to enforce street vendors they're saying to her side on a city block\nIt would allow the creation of special vending districts with customized rules allowing more or\nFewer vendors in the area again if I'm a store and I've got an inventory up and I've got to pay minimum wage and I've got to do all the hoops are going to jump through and then I got a vendor opening and selling tacos and I'm a taco restaurant I Would not be really happy about that\nHi this is\nIt looks like the Silicon Valley gig ... turning on their own creation stretches making these stupid some horse people are suing some people because thinking we makes writing less fun\nAnd the Dodgers this
