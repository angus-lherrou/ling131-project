I worked with insurance why not ... I'm going to not if he gets resolved yeah I'm going I'm going to let\nYou answer what you mean by that but to me although they are very different things to me what Colin Kaepernick has done is similar in terms of getting attention to what Conyers just I'm just did it kinda quickly and in in a crude way why not the right time tell me what that means\nI just I respectfully disagree\nYeah yeah that's why we know it\nProtects particularly for particularly again as an African American community where we already know that there are a lot of people in the public sphere do not\nView African American opinions with the right context they think it's a shorthand to have ... at the White House that's talking to the black community that's not talking to the black community and so what bothers me about it is\nYou don't want to have a serious conversation you want a photo up and you want to have a an a platform to say I have more black supporters than I actually asked\nFor a meeting and I was saying I Know what you got to that point but but no one came out of that at that\nMeeting saying oh now let the black community rallies around Donald Trump I think even Donald Trump know that the black community hey have right now that he does not have their support\nAnd I think he even admitted that when you know kind of look how he's been treated for being a supporter of mine\nUm the black community has set their door on hand and told him to shut up\nSo I think that's what it was after that I'm saying it was just like going out and didn't represent the black community or or not I think Don where their management why why not is kind of a meat to the president of the president finds him somewhat a persuasive if he does that state prison reform if you judge changes his views on stop and frisk why is that a bad thing that's all I'm asking\nAbout ... and that is not the representation that is not the representation of the African American community that I as someone who by the way I work very hard to be educated to be informed on the issues to to build my professional life around being that to have\nBlack intellectualism and blacks fought on those types of issues reduced to that display that we saw\nHim disrespecting the oval office disrespecting the public discourse around these issues talking about an iPhone yeah or or an odd plane mines\nLike to join you know Jimmy that Brett Kavanaugh doesn't speak for every white man tiny doesn't speak for the entire and we're going to hold on your work\nA little it works a little differently\nWell let me let me be granted this right let me plenty for everything that I Would much prefer\nTo see Joel pain in the in the oval office everybody was talking to well you and I would we'd never heard much prefer it and ... I Love you but you would not have gotten the where the guy knew a guy yesterday in terms of the attention does that matter to me don't about\nThe tension it's not about the attention it's about the intention go ahead why what the intention ... go ahead\nWhat Kanye ... tell me what was what what came out of that all came out of that is Donald Trump being able to say oh I I met I met with a ... a prominent\nAfrican American I met with black leadership I met with Jim Jim Brown by the way who ... who is kind of kind of skated by yeah yeah I think we need to spend a little bit of turmoil me well tell me wondering about that I just do not I just do not think that that was going to get a view this very personally so yeah maybe we're just going to do this differently\nI listen I Know I'm not going anywhere in the street\nThat the the history of how African Americans are viewed in in hearken Americans are viewed within this administration that was a clown show and\nSanta get way way way way way to say it again\nA clown show clown that Cindy I\nHeard I heard a number is eight hundred to two to five to two is going to respond to Charles comments I heard Don Lemon said minstrel show and I was sort of weirdly upset and hurt I don't know that bothered me\nDo I heard a microbe outlook that's\nHow I heard and I said if you had an assault on the way [laughter] what kind of was well\nWell look at it on the CNN there was another comment the other day was a little called honey a token and I'm not interested in that I I don't\nThink you I don't want to thank you I think that gets hired that it's just I don't think that's helpful that help library\nUm but I Will tell you this there are a lot of African Americans who felt that way\n[laughter] yeah I Know I Know so and I don't think that's helpful I regret it but I don't know\nFor me for for me having a public dialogue about this too that's not cause that's not the primary is the primary issue is there are people dying in Chicago people being left behind by the manufacturing industry that's what they were talking about by the way you're actually involved in Chicago a prison reform yeah there are people\nWho are really being lost in the system it angers me that instead of having a real conversation with real thought leaders you had a he had an a forty five minute session with cognac where I don't think much was done to advance the cause of African American life in this country\nWhat would you what would you what kind of solutions would you like to see because here is again I just think there are strained repercussions of what he did yesterday here we are talking about it but go ahead what should we be doing\nWell for one I mean he should be given some thought to his own agenda and his budget and how it's highly organized budget but his his his public policy and how it treats African American look at the Jeff Sessions Justice Department they think that they've done to roll back civil rights protection I mean they're having a conversation about the thirteenth amendment\nYesterday and about about a rolling back slavery it just explained to me how that that's not helpful that doesn't that doesn't\n... wants to talk about slavery being a a a a frame of mind and the host or real thing I don't think he's on this earth with us and I don't say that with with a lot of I'm not trying to be

just felt\nBasically having him on was offensive to look like myself because it kind of a cheap ploy but from another perspective I feel like in a different type of state of mind in regards to his

I mean why we might have not been any award show or any kind of a better your point is well known\nAs the audience here and so when a black American the truck trying to reach out\nIt is offensive because I Know how many people have weapons that African American and you know that it just got caught control the media cycle and it was perfectly and you will to do that\nBut you're ... when he let me um nobody underline your point which I think it's a reasonable one which is that okay he he his bipolar disorder has been sort of out of control and now he's saying I was misdiagnosed and that kind of ...\nPicking up there I think Sharif I suspect and\nUh as such there's something to that it's like somebody should have this was sort of withdrawal was saying to elect somebody should've contained him somebody should be looking after him they didn't they know how this was going to look and there there's something to that and you're saying on top of that you would blame the Trump for exploiting

that however let's be real [laughter] anything really\nWell I don't know I don't know if I'm hum as maybe an unrealistic but well\nHere's what I think about overall yeah I Do get crap yeah overtime

getting people involved I Love it I Hope\nThat we're all going but we'll see I I bought them is with with a little bit of a man I Will say oh Daniel go ahead\n[noise] I guess uh I just think that in general I think we shouldn't act we shouldn't have a nice ... and act as if any president on any political side is not going to enjoy political benefits of having a celebrity get cheerleading him\nAnd I don't think this is Trump doing something outrageous like at ... never been done before on any other fashion I think it said you know whoever doesn't like the current president's gonna bash on whoever he has any next year when it whatsoever you know when it put over to another yup local party they're going to you know it's going to go back and forth and it it's just\nPeople who can't actually recognize the humanity and the and the experience that I'm having one of the culture shift that way\nLife is short and I don't know that I have time\nI understand that but I Would argue for different argument [laughter] right and I are going to get that one well for this I work I work at heart go ahead go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead [laughter] I'm so sorry Laurent and like I don't I'm not\nJust people are black and white button but voting is is nuanced and I you know I got an argument with my parents when they voted for Trump\nBut they weren't voting for him because of his ... you know white supremacy beliefs or anything like that and they were voting because they thought that he was going to give them tax cuts and they thought that he was going to do something about immigration and that was literally the two reasons that they were voting for him\nUm and you know the other stuff they get with him is a symptom of that\nBut for me to not have a relationship with them because they voted for a person that I disagree with you know I I have so many friends on both sides have so many friends that are Trump supporters I've so many friends that are really progressive liberal ... Democrats and\nAnd if I cut off one or the other I mean as a journalist I Would never do that because I'm I'm interested in hearing both perspective but also how can you ever persuade someone if they're inside an ... echo chamber and they're only listening to people have their very same belief that that doesn't help anyone cross over into new thinking\nThat it's kind of an American but I totally support Lynn going too far too busy for this [laughter] that's okay with me with Lourdes what doctors do our\nI don't know how much clear I can make it is but there is only one name to trust if you want to face\nOr neck left without surgery Dr wrestler I go there and I put my name on it because I've seen the results Dr wrestler on the team in L.

mean all good or bad thinking yeah and then and then they'd be human is Asian follows\nAnd the other thing is the accusation standing as fact accuse us factually the case that you did it ah and that's how you you know that's how this all goes down there and the people\nThe people who might be benefiting from that one of the nation and that are are people that have absolutely no interest in the United states a healthy\nA political ah\nWell I mean when you really look at what the Russian meddling was wasn't it really all about fomenting all of this\nReally that's what they were doing they weren't so much getting votes going way or another so much as getting buddies stirred up in a very ah dysfunctional way\nWell the problem too is that I don't hear many radio um talk host ... you know they're either they or their liberal I like it that you have\nA yet you try to stay with a tree and and to be a little and respect for a you know the economy was seen that's another story but you know

ahead\n[noise] hey ah thanks for having me on the show I just wanted to comment one thing about the ... was a ... without going into the pro Trump or anti Trump the one positive thing that I got out of it it was that a man\nThat is so prominent in the entertainment industry he uh he ... he has the courage no matter how in perfectly\nYou have the courage to speak the way that he felt about the very unpopular issue in Hollywood and and I saw that that was a in an industry where so many people are marginalized because of their ideology or I just I I I just um I appreciated\nThat it was correctly and what do you call it courageous when somebody does something out of the norm right\nWell ... not so much out of the norm but in the face of of of of opposition or what or what could be considered criticism\nOr and and I entertainment and just got a rapid everybody appreciate\nThe call him up against the clock thank you so much Sarah Lawrence found out to do it is Monday

that two o'clock I'm Rob marine do\nThis check of the news is backing of Idaho on consignment center\nDoctors but talking about this issue in the scary possibilities for nearly a year now and the outbreak if we born type cases in LA county is spreading with health officials announcing today they're investigating\nThat are are barely getting by and the lady of LA but starting there's not enough parking anyway the subject is eight hundred to two to five to two to John you want to come and go ahead [noise]\n[noise] yeah I just think this is more or why it's so important to get conservative judges and why you know a lot of Republicans so if the idea that a judge to think a lot of fair with individual person I just decided to follow the law\nBut I always I have sympathy for someone to get paid but you can't just say well it's the person is homeless they don't they don't have to pay their parking\nSo it's sort of a legislation from the batch\nIt's definitely legislation [noise] I'm\nJust I'm so on the fence on this one this is among legitimately on their way not on the no no I'm I'm looking for a middle ground years amber legitimately on the fence and that is what's called being on the fence so John what are you [laughter]\nSo what do you do\nThere is always a point where you know whenever you go and you get or any kind of penalty\nThe judge always has a little discussion to let you give you more time to pay or or do other things you know give you a reduced a penalty or maybe reduce the the fine or whatever but this is this is judges specifically saying I I don't think it's fair for certain groups of people that make you a law\nYeah no they're saying you can't go after them so that that if anything happened to a hospital bills and he can't pay your hospital bill and you can prove your income that you were ... below a certain line they will change the price for you\nYes that's true yeah this is this people don't understand the medical system will find a way to\nWork at our negotiations that can be Miller Frank your comic go ahead\nYeah I just thank the lord that I Do not live in Los Angeles county I live across the line and ... is a better word to the\nYeah the only other oldest better up here there's more accountability because we can get them to the people we always between Chicago and Los Angeles is the fact Chicago has the reputation of being corrupt\nThan immortal was and uh my only other comment is just another and still have to work also asked the question where the money go for all the ... goes into the court system who gets paid by the court system all the judges so they have an incentive to make sure the fun\nBut then why would the judges to decide against against the fines that doesn't make sense\nWas probably you probably have one you always get one a lawyer and the old he's going to do is just raised the amount of\nIt comes from the people like you and I have to pay the gift show that were homeless indigenous how about the guy that cut his car impounded did he have a driver's license because we have insurance you can't drive in the state without insurance\nBut you have to understand Frank and um you're lucky to live in Ventura County but there are so many people that moved to Los Angeles that do not have a home they live out of their cars\nBut because they can live out of their cars they go to work and they managed to get by and eventually they don't live in their cars anymore so to penalize these people that are still trying to hold down a job well not having a place to live by living in their car it does seem unfair to\nTo to constantly rack up tickets and\nYou know and prevent these people from going to work by an pounding their vehicle and giving them no place to live I can understand that you have to be able to prove that though\nI think he's right about the fees elsewhere though Amy go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think it is the goal is to allow these people who were but I keep them accountable for what they did they can think of all of this community service other things that's really neat it\nWas paying what about that I mean I think I'm fine with that but some of these people are are holding down multiple jobs you know I I don't and I think that's the whole\nReason for this that they can't keep their jobs if their cars getting pounded they don't have the money to pay these tickets so I'm not sure that they have a whole lot of free time for community service button I maybe I'm wrong ...\nCall your somewhere comic go ahead\nYeah I was just a community services actually the solution to this is for people who are unable to make a\nFamous or have money to pay or something to that effect and even if they have limited time that can be something that can be a educated in in the court the judge to say okay well you're working two jobs and you're making this All right well then you only work uh for three hours on Saturday picking\nUp garbage or something to that effect that's better than just saying oh well you can't afford it so then we'll just let you off because when you're doing that and there's no accountability for your well\nYour behavior that's not what it should be then that doesn't keep you from doing it because the reason for the fun is supposed to be as a deterrent\nRight that's true it is supposed to be in a cavity actually thank you Carl credit Chevy you actually got some sort of community service correct\nYes I have a full time job and I was on disability and the judge was asking people who could afford it and who couldn't and I told your my Jewish and and I got thirty hours of community service and you know you don't need a lot of services\nYou're not just picking up on the freeway\nYes yes you are so right so so in a way we're sort of forcing a dad\nThat we all I Know that yeah we ought to be subjected to anywhere\nRight right thank you very much for taking my call\n... thanks for the comment or not I'm not quite sure we're always going to go here Kelly go ahead\nYeah I think you know eventually it's gonna be like downtown Bangladesh or yeah or people ride on his sphere and the guy across the road we'll just go in gridlock everywhere ruined by the way I'm Sorry your co hosts the female Loren Loren\nWhy do why do you lock your doors every day you just put a sign on and say hey I'm working come on and make yourself at home but it gone by which is when I get home\nI'm not I don't understand why the term for your logic I met her or go make make that point\nIf you will if you want it to make it easy for everybody if you really have compassionate he personally have compassion when you leave every day and your house is empty why don't you just make it available to the homeless people\nAre so concerned but I'm not talking about ... I'm not talking about the people living on Skid Row that have multiple problems and talking about the working poor that the only\nDifference from than living in shelters is living in their cars and a lot of those people get hit with the fines or get their cars impounded which not only prevents them from from working which we want them to do but they have no place to live and no way of paying off the science that was my point\nYeah but even better for you to leave them a list of things to do and then that will accomplish that will compensate them for you letting them use your house for the day when you're not there I mean if you're really really into compassion do something that's meaningful rather than just make everybody else do you\nReally don't know how and making everybody I'll do it for me but I I yes that would be wonderful if I have household chores they can provide for me I don't know if the county of Los Angeles it'd be okay with that but I'm up for it\nTo me interesting

Francisco I'm a professional musician I drive all over the place for work luckily my family was there to help me out it is impossible to live in the city without recognition ridiculous parking tickets\nAnd yeah it ...\nIt would it be ruined his if I didn't have my family to help me at the time it would have ruined me to take care of all the parking tickets it's just inevitable you cannot live you can't have a car in the city if you live in the city\nAnd not rack up parking tickets and I think to to empower somebody's car for something that is a very low impact in terms of society crime interest would be ruined it to someone's\nLife and I agree and I like you you\nLiked the idea of a community service a vote on an individual Lawrence house eight hundred to two to three writers right\nDo they set that up on purpose if you go to Korea time to go to downtown LA there is not enough parking spaces than they do that on purpose there has been in this city so that they can give out tickets and gain revenue\nSo so Russ you do bring up another point though which is we we don't rarely talk about which is the support a family and friends when you hit hard times I mean\nThat's how you keep people off the streets that's how you keep people afloat that's how people are very propelled forward to solve problems so they can get through whatever tough time they've got it it's the ones in our lives that we should be relying on do you agree with that\nTotally\nBut not everyone has or yeah are you saying look you know what\nI understand and I but I just I just want to emphasize that that that is something we should all be thinking about if you have some of your life was struggling in your your our job is to support those people are Theresa you disagree with all this\nUh

of whole both people those people were not getting help from their families because they wouldn't help them you could say that 'til the end of time everybody smart enough to know that but it just doesn't happen a lot of time\nAnd certainly if they go on with the extra charge costs that they want to charge people it's a waste of money and time they'll ever come up with bloody and and the
