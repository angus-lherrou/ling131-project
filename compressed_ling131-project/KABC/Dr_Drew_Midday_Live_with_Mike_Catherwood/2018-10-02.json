hearing and plays right\n[noise] yeah so it's interesting just to catch the listeners up so uh the county of orange and the city of orange Anaheim Costa Mesa we sued the state of California and the Orange County needle exchange program\nBecause we didn't feel they had an adequate plan in place to protect the public during this needle exchange which you know it's just not needle exchange it's a bunch of other things but\nPrimarily needle exchange and so we're in court in San Diego yesterday and actually it was a little nervy nerve wracking because the judge issued\nWhat's called a tentative ruling before we all got their I'm basically saying that this is my impression of the case but after hearing oral argument I think the judge was taken aback that there are a lot of unanswered questions and so he has set a hearing\nFor November thirteenth\nAnd it it the hearing is going to involve both sides presenting their case what is the case I I I've been a little confused what the forces that are lined against you what do they think\n[noise] so we're we're actually suing the state of California over its approval to life sentence the orange cutting needle exchange do mobile exchanges in\nThree of orange county's cities to show the state so the attorney general uh but Sarah staff attorney general but Sarah they're actually litigating the case against us on behalf of the state of California and they're saying that the orange Kevin needle exchanges application was adequate\nThat their their issues in terms of disposal and protecting the public were dressed\nAnd we believe that it hasn't been addressing last time I was on I had just gone to one of the public hearings that was hosted by the Orange County needle exchange and well I told you at that time this was all staffed by volunteers\nStudents medical students other students at University of California Irvine while they in I think they have the best of intentions I really do I just think that\nIt's this is a huge daunting task and uh you know whether or not people\nAre properly disposing of needles is a very very scary issue\nFor the residents of Orange County ...\nUsing the evidence the Santa Ana riverbed and what has happened in San Francisco is that your evidence\n[noise] well it's interesting because the judge actually I mean we haven't gotten really deep into the weeds on that we argued that is one of our basic uh sets of evidence of what happened on the river bed but\nUnit so you can melt down the methamphetamine or cocaine so you can draw up into the syringe this is a dispersing

get involved in the distribution of ...\nYou also don't want to they also don't want to is as professionals they would know they would be enabling drug addicts and they would be much better at holding the line and giving them what they need rather than whatever they want\nRight understand but today these programs sanctioned by the state of California allow the distribution of all\nThese paraphernalia and it's ... and all you hear me to a quiet\nSo what I'm saying is rather than a loud they allow it but a pharmacist wouldn't do it because they would understand there would be enabling problematic\nHemorrhagic the pharmacist wouldn't do that you know\nThat's my question to you is how do you then move forward with your idea which I think his ex soldiers ... needle exchange but then where do you draw the line on the distribution of these other things\nI mean here's what I say I'd I'd say any of you out there who are executives at CBS called thoughts ... now because of the great

now that would make less than reasoning line and again it becomes defensible if it makes sense what I'd like to know more diplomatic and that it and I would also argue optics everybody\nDo man you don't want to let bad America a\nEight hundred to junior high enough baggage wow man I was so upset about it I I mean and as I said every week since Mr Trump ascended to office\nEvery week that's a

could not imagine a worst standard to live\nUp to I was a ... year old male is not my best [laughter] and so we've been up to that members was made up and it was insane it was truly and say well\nYou know and I think you know the take home for all let's not without uh\nThe casting any aspersions on either you know judge Kavanaugh who's a\nWho's a protest stations of innocence I Do believe I find credible let's put it that way I think the evidence is in his favor without casting aspersions on a doctor blah before who clearly has a story within you know and she's clearly troubled uh but I think you know we all have to\nUh you know look objectively at a you know at at where we are now and uh you know start getting perspective and proportion a into our heads so that in the midst of this political little late that we have a you know we\nCan all step back and\nSay wait a minute you know let's look at what our culture was like in those days we cannot judge young people's feet we can't condemn people retrospectively let's put it that way for a culture that we now all find to have had very ugly aspects\nYeah but I mean whether or not whether or not hammer talking about\nBinge drinking and that kind of thing is sexually alls I don't remember ever being okay\nNo Lauren ... and of course speaking with you with full respect no it was you're right it was never okay\nA at all um but\nI Will say that I think the debt and I I listened to and I and I regret that I cannot remember her name but the head of the national Women's Law center\nAppeared with Chris Wallace of Fox News and I think it's about the name of the organization correct and she uh the offered a startling statistic uh which is that one is three women in this country\nA has been sexually assaulted\n... are going to have only one I've got about two three hours but the thirty ... many women more than one way or the two of her but half of the the the the population I don't think of it as a sexual assault dude I mean they've been doing with that was they would go back to me\nAre are can be great because exactly you're\nRight how do we define these things and I say you know I I Know from my own part and I I I sound like\n... I I I've been very blessed obviously my my mother in her generation use a beautiful young woman in Britain and uh her employers tried to take advantage of her she responded she was a four year veteran of war and she said that's it I'm leaving yes I Know it was amazing but\nBut her generation made it possible for people like me to step forward in ways that she couldn't uh but I've been very blessed I I really never had\nA anything in my life or any of my friends that I ever knew about that you know would I Would would constitute assault\nEver so I don't know what the the definitions are but I have to respect the statistics and I think what ... what we're entering is a new age of awareness of weariness of surveillance\nAnd of processing procedure I mean it it is a new a new era\nOr the or augmented procedure though I I Want her training here last week and a and a good sort of suggests to me the process a procedure isn't quite yet in place\nNo no well right\nRight right and so we do need that we need somewhere but Lawrence what our concern there was some before ... am worried about this review to proceed renewed away of road\nAbsolutely absolutely am you know the the slogan believe women believe women believe women but that them you know they're the most women are telling the truth but occasionally someone you know might make up a story and have a false accusation and I I don't know if they are going wrong where am I\nGoing to produce misconstrue or destroyed or whatever I Want to call anybody wires\nVoted on women did live Duke lacrosse case you think of some people that I've been you know um wrongly accused of rape it it does destroy lives it does destroy careers\nAnd so I don't think there's anything wrong with you know if you're a woman and you're telling the truth I don't think there's anything wrong with being read it and your story being corroborated are checked out and when there's no evidence and it's just the ... you know he said she said it gets a lot more difficult\nBut ... I don't think that everybody's just taking every woman on face value when running with it I think we are looking for ways to kind of um validate stories\nWell and and that's just it and and so the important culturally and this isn't something that has been focused on here to for a it really is that you know we have to and you know nobody should be deterred by the uh the the in Berlin that's going on now in the cabinet\nA hearing for you know and it's going on for many different reasons but ... every every woman in every man should should take the message that\nIf something is wrong you know draw attention to it immediately in any way you can't yeah\nYeah if there's any lessons learned here or there are as royale everyone make a social media posts about it whenever you have to do wrong to have a record right yeah ...\n... worth member in a better word was foreign board of directors probably our W F come up with a position paper or they always are very you know that it could damage and they're sort of approach to ...\n... to propose a sort of your own six word recommendations for how to approach these single or married looked are going to be rough and organizations to help lead us I don't know why aren't there what are we right\nActually at the end I fully agree\nUh and we have a a remarkable a group of of fellows are and to members obviously supporters so yes a that we are in a great position to do that because\nWe do come at it from the position of war and as you said uh you know believe he listened to people believe a you give them the benefit of of trust and make sure that we're developing evidence make sure that you know we we do\nA give everybody a the benefit of that presumption of innocence I Do have a personal friend of the family who was falsely accused a years ago as a as a young fellow and it was a it was deeply traumatic\nOr in this little road we'll everybody has to have representation here I Want to call here from Valerie Valerie go ahead\nI'm yeah Hi I mean I grew up in the early eighties I was a teenager at Fifteen sixteen Seventeen years old at growing up I we went to parties as kids uh we drank alcohol um I'm not trying to justify you know some of the activities that I witnessed but\nYou can truly say they're with sexual assault going on at parties whether it be with a girl who was\nYou know half out at a guy doing something to her or um something\nHaving had happened to me where you know you're trying to meet a guy and then all of a sudden the next next minute you know they're trying to grow when they're out of

had this conversation I'm back in the eighties it was a really interesting time because we were teenagers all discovering what our sexuality was I mean this was a time where it was very awkward to admit you were gay and it was very awkward right if\nSomeone called you pay your like heck no I'm not an all boys at that age we're really trying to\nProve to not only themselves to other people that

we got our stuff back you know he did he you know trotted out the mayor rolling their ... big dog and pony show only for our you know five six days later\nFor her to be released without any condition there was no circumstantial evidence of physical evidence\nAnd the only thing I found was she had dropped her cell phone in that parking writers and that's why they lend today and that I asked people drop their own all the time\nWas well they also said that um she had ...\nNear the woman's car [laughter]\nThere were cars in that parking lot in the video no one ever heard from is counted until now finally telling her story and and part of this story which is really alarming is the fact that she said that the shift to take this hold her she didn't belong there that's why she set out that's why they questioned her and you know the\nLong meaning that they are very wealthy white well in our class neighborhood and so for her to be at this location with such that\nYes they questioned her about where she got her money from um how she could afford to be on the on Dr mothers' day\nThey had followed her they saw her in Beverly Hills [noise] um and but\nThe biggest issue I have this whole story that woman's life was ruined behind being ... cute straight so we're just about a soccer mom a former probation officer church at home mom will not her off at college who you know the football the

right and and what ...\nWhat was the theory of the motivation\nI I bet all of the money that it was ... that's what\nThey said that they they couldn't figure out if there's a random or if it was targeted but for them they kept saying that it it was well every year we almost six months later she still has a big cars not guilty\nAnd she hasn't been a pilot apologized to either\nStop privately nor publicly right at the murder is still must\nBe clear like there are two victims in this story I'm not going to forget the fact that he's the lead was murdered right but\nThat case is still unsolved [laughter] you know and you know the show about nothing and it's really interesting they had a press conference yesterday I was there you know her turning left to go to lunch out the word they walk into the same restaurant at McDonalds dining and\nReally weird cool with that I have a\nVery you know weird but McDonald has not apologized to her no one has apologized to her and so you

are preserved for all over them I think I'm I think I'm a libertarian and then all of a sudden I'm asking for government help on things\nSo and clearly an enigma you are speaking of enigma and Peggy that help us understand this um this law what you just read about in terms of the Trump Administration hoping visas for same sex partners\nSo they're no longer going to provide visas for same sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats\nOf the union so meaning if you are the same sex couple that had married you can get a visa\nBut if you are just as same sex domestic partner we will no longer provide you a visa and for many of the country that take part in the un same sex marriage is not legal and many of their countries which is why they aren't married\nBut I'm the thinking behind this according to the state department is slightly backward and they say that decision is meant to ensure and promote equal treatment\nBecause heterosexual domestic partners of foreign diplomats are also not eligible for us and he says meaning if you have a girlfriend and you want to bring her long she's not eligible for a visa you'd\nHave to be married to this person but I'm I'm not sure why\nAre they being allowed in the first place\nIf you couldn't breath you had a girlfriend or along stand oh I see a mother of your child not married 'cause a lot of countries don't allow gay marriage and allow gay marriage ...\n\nSo what the state department is saying that that law was in effect since two thousand nine but the Trump Administration is saying because same sex marriage is now legal in the U.S [noise] it's no longer necessary to grant the says she thinks\nThat show can these couples from other countries get married when they come over here and and just regular the legal in their country who care they get the research that way to survive but can you just come here and get my money you know what I Am I'm going to ask you one that I Am going to ask this guy\nUm it just seems weird though that\nYou would well I guess luck if you're in a I don't know why if you're going to if you're not going to offer a visa to it like a girlfriend or boyfriend then why would you offer a visa to someone in a domestic relationship yeah I guess that makes sense although I don't know\nAt some part of me feels like this and smelled homophobic somehow but I just\nWas homophobic ad very minimal what sounded way worse than it is out is dreaming homophobic\nBut it it at the very minimum it you would have to take a moral position that these other countries are wrong and not allowing gay marriage and therefore\nThat is that we allow it here so unless you're married\nBut but mind you we're we are supporting their wrong position by right you know so I don't know it's a really interesting question it it's not simple so good it's starting to make a little more sense now at least\nWe're going to be speaking to Michael Santo he is the University of Miami professor apartment or national started up the baking we'll take your calls eight hundred to two to five to ... to do you think this is an inappropriate provision should we be continuing the law as it has been I have you know\nThen it really um it's unfair to heterosexual couples that aren't married you know\nRight except not because it gets heterosexual couples that aren't married aren't married ...\nAren't so because of the laws of the land where they ... from they're not married because they're not married because they don't want any near the reality is that where they can't get married right oh it's a really interesting question\nAgain the number eight hundred to two to five to to do with back with more of this topic and your calls correspondence through the summit they live [noise]\n\nWas an

just randomly players like okay that's a court will be but you know I I\nThink a little bit leery of like really really building up this issue 'cause even the world that was created and the Obama administration I'm a little bit skeptical about cause if you're a diplomat let's say at the un from a kind of enemy country actually Iran and they're probably gonna Stoller execute\nYou right now and then all I have yeah yeah yeah\nAnd so you can't get married and Iran do you really but you're part of the U.N mission you really want to somehow get us same sex visa\nRight you know that's kind of out of yourself and then\nYeah that's an extreme example but even if it's like maybe a cherry I if you're not too friendly and that idea or most countries in the world unfortunately I'm not sure maybe most Arab countries or Pakistan\nWhy you got them there are some countries where it's just not a legal possibility that other countries like you were mentioning Iran where it's really criminalizing you could help yeah\nWell I mean I assume I mean I just I I think it's a little bit problematic and and I wonder you know what makes us America is that we do you advocate for civil rights throughout the world and that were leaders and it's something I think we're ...\nWilkins and Democrats up onto this a ministry should\nRecognize and they know I I'm not speaking about Nikki Haley serious skepticism about a president obviously right now who loves the north Korean leader includes more than any other leader but this is what makes America that we advocate for civil rights but I'm not sure this is quite the right place and a couple of levels first of all\nDiplomats function as intermediaries between different governments and different societies\nAnd I'm not sure if they are not in a friendly environment for same sex couples if it really serves their job you know ...\nYou have to make sacrifices for their jobs and I'm not sure that we're doing them any good like we we don't want to help undermine their position you know that doesn't serve our long term goals there's or their countries and so I I'm a little bit skeptical about whether this is a critical\nAre entirely helpful world that's been played a little bit devil's advocate that has been reversed and I think that I mean\nDo we really want to give a special views or if it goes against the feelings of that country's population and might undermine that diplomatic staff or did diplomats ability to do their job\nAnd I think for example when you work for the U.S State Department sometime you sometimes are not able to take your significant other with you that's kind of part of the job I\nWas talking to Michael Sam throws University of Miami professor a department of International Studies us the global economy you brought up north Korea do I I hate to just completely switch gears on you but you have hope for what's going on there and me north and south or at least seemed to be\nMaking nice yeah I I Do actually have hope and the reason is\nBecause of President Trump is falling in love with Kim Jong or the southern part of our getting enough\nThough I mean ... you know Trump never ... you know you have to give him credit like the new always exciting every day you wake up you know something really really\nEvery day for ... well\nI Would argue that the art of the news is addicted to him literally he brought that up at the press conference in New York Times that you're putting other three places the front page so you sell your papers without you would say your papers CNN is addicted to Trump that there are at MSNBC addicted to drugs that's\nWhy I'm addicted to Trump because it's so insane like\nThat's why we're not good for our news cycle it just I Can't figure out what's going on because all around here is the windows were rhetorical craziness\nWell this and this is not just rhetorical craziness I've been convinced for a few years is basically ends\nIn with him going to prison the Trump Organization I Do believe is a Russian money laundering operation basically and the fact that he's president if states is a huge huge national security problem and he's constantly like you know when he's not lying usually what he says it's nonsensical but there does appear to be massive criminal exposure\nAnd the only way I can see him basically getting out of prison\nIs if the New York state prosecutors which no president can part in New York state crimes basically said if you resign as president we will basically you know do a deal where we won't press and he charges against two um he just just so praising Lee breaks every rural\nThat it it appears to me that his criminal liability is just enormous and he and his close family members just don't didn't seem to know what they were doing you know basically an enemy country approaches Trump sun\nAnd says will help you win the election and he says I Love it just shows how clueless some of the central people are um Flynn who had the fire was national security advisor was on Russian TV giving a standing ovation for boots and so on Russian television\nYou don't a point that guy is national security advisor that's well\nThat's
