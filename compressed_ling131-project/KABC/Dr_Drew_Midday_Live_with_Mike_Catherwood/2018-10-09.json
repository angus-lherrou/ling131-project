them\nAnd um they uh are not quiet they speak that they'll be I'm Talking about a couple of years out of things that we've seen here they are the last time I really talk to them was during the the Trump candidacy and my question then what was huh\nReally what what is it ... why do you what does he have a lot in my whole thing during the Trump or the ascension to the pregnancy was like\nWhat what is it you're saying here what am I missing how what a lot of very strange early on they were very much up over the let me take a quick call before you go to break this is Paul Paul go ahead\nOr just to comment on the homeless crisis um there's some amazing program out of Albuquerque\nOr the mirror and experience of encountering a homeless person but a sign saying well work and he thought you know what are we started taking them up on that offer and she organized the whole moving around having of and pick up almost getting to work and ... they're homeless situation I I Wish calcium in anger where on because I'd like to run this by I mean well\nThe problem is the problem is you know Mitch put set up for instance he set up showers you said at fourteen shower is set up a tent shower or something for the homeless and he what he discovered was on average you took fourteen attempts to get somebody just to take a shower\nSo you have the resistance chronically mentally ill here that they're not this is their population is not going to be working until they get their mental illness square and so I Would say\nThat I Would say that is true but look at how young\nThat would you go Paul huh oh we lost\nYour most sorry about that I'm now that doesn't mean amongst the homeless there or not people for whom that could work quite well and I'm fully on board for these sort of temporary homeless population and the er the couch surfing population or those without that are not chronically homeless chronically mentally ill are chronically homeless\nAbsolutely the the job sort of a finding some way to\nRally employ and get a vocational rehabilitation for these folks oh um I think that's a great\nIdea eight hundred to two to five to two two is our phone number we are going to be speaking reduction immigration after the break we're going to talk a mess and all things in the federal government for the moment on things that are hitting the headlines a large one doctor do it but they live and talk radio some Medicaid BC will take a break for some news with Rob rancor [noise]\n\nYou can grab a thousand dollars or more times\nWhere do I grant here it's so not\nThere for a day on seven Ninety have the money starts falling from the sky at six and nine with Doug ... with Dr Andrew in Lawrence\nWith Jillian and John Kades ABC Los Angeles county cumulus state [noise] baby see news\nLive in local lead one o'clock I'm Robin ... told tens of thousands of residents and tourists to get away from the Gulf Coast to head the arrival of hurricane Michael meteorologist Allison ... uh what is expected to be a category three store now within hours\nWith Republican if you leave after or just for that that that that kind of sticks with you if you get out and say look I I left ... terms thank you very much she's the most popular member of his cabinet\nOh interest told about light I you know the\nPolling um her favorability is actually about sixty percent she's yes I Do think Shia political ambition in the future and I think this is a very they have a very shrewd a calculated political live on the part\nVery interesting I I get but I I'm Still curious\nWhat what she intends to accomplish job he was having money troubles in that she might be exiting in order to land some kind of CEO position where she she can make more money is there any truth\nTo that or those just rumors were on\nNo I think you're spot on I mean I think I think she would I Would not be surprised\nWe saw her cash out and take a look at it as sort of Wall Street type of job I mean she's got a lot of options\nAvailable to her now another sort of more nefarious were floating around is that Lindsey Graham who of course a U.S senator from South Carolina where Nikki Haley is from that lady grounded angling to take over for Jeff Sessions\nShould Jeff Sessions resigned they fired what have you after the midterms\nInteresting I did that happen that of course Nikki Haley would be well positioned to be appointed to you know\nA a there are three hours to make sense now than that because there really is a political animal I don't see her absolutely yeah I don't see her jumping out right no no no I just thought it up for a bigger race you know I'm the editor Nikki Haley right\nYeah and I think that makes sense I mean you saw her um while praising you know everybody in the Trump family you know how she she ... and ... you said this quite while she's a political animal and she knows what makes Trump tech\nSo you praise him he prays crumbling Barbie vodka you praise questionnaire and then everybody's happy so I think she certainly and and look it doesn't surfer to bash Trump Trump is popular with Republicans he's very popular in South Carolina that would be crazy\n... hold on or were you know what's weird it it kind of feel that those little axes forming here with her and Lindsey Graham and Donald Trump I'd I really thought about that you brought it up but I can see it you know it took a political access there's forums\nAnd that's really very interesting because in a weird way the two of them have been Trump's biggest sort of soldiers that are\nGuaranteed balances out on his his cheerleading and your bidding and stuff\nAnd more than more than McConnell everybody else and and they're kind of a line and now they may have been a line but that's just fascinating\nOkay well that that starts to make some sense to me now I'm here so we were the other store we were looking at is ... of course I was from spin on a lot of the White House making comments about Jim Brown and ... coming to visit him and what he does for African American jobs and blah blah blah\nUm what do we think about that ah I I don't I see I guess it's more from the Trump SARS is far from the ... side\nVery spots on the Trump cited many ways it you know it well I'll say very smart as smart as token gay rights have Taylor Swift out there who is boosting you know nothing to our website for voter registration which it and he does not want donors\nSo we do that or do we know that anger Taylor Swift\nAnd college they have a well it does seem low says her followers she has endorsed for example Bill Braniff and with the Democratic candidate for US Senate and the ...\nI I just I Wonder and I I just this is strictly a you know sort of a a guy that uses evidence me or you don't have a scientist so I Need evidence is what I hear that they're breaking down were registration sites you know the assumption would be democratic registration but I thought oh my God I mean the aftermath of Kavanaugh's could be Republican\nFor registration poured pouring in and you know the sort\nOf added on if you're following Twitter of the doubt if you're following\nYeah I I agree with you more and they get this was actually um the CNN is reporting that Taylor Swift post on the ground is what spurred a lot of a young folks\nTo register the Swiss cheese yeah but I started the swift and fifties and it sounds like a like a mock her fans and the mob doesn't want to look at it that way as opposed to a bar or\nWhat is that he was found out you know so I think that\nThis is a move on Trump's part the problem is that you know African American voters overwhelmingly despised Trump because they see I'm forty and not jak ... so he can parade out certain rules folks as surrogates but it's not really going to work\nWith the people that child trying you know to effect if I'm really not here in Florida\nThat degrees and I have to point out this for tiny can set a bunch of crazy stuff and whether or not you follow him I Believe in in politics and whatnot\nI have to say I am it does show an intolerance from the left that he can't even support a political candidate without being shunned by the African American community by the entertainment industry is I host\nSNL ran what he said he was being bullied and he was told\nAnyone anywhere on where not to wear the hat I mean there is an intolerance from the left that if you you know you're allowed to speak your political views only if you agree with that we don't we will make you feel the pain\nAnd let's be fair and you're talking about left and not liberal ride this without the stick show sort of making yesterday if you go all the way left you were into roof shows territory of man generally hang on your mandating\nTolerance which implies empower correct that's when I ... the name of tolerance and that's the logical conclusion of abject tolerance so I'll I'll talk about Dr ...\nWell I mean look the communist himself has said things that are sort of and there and the top\nI Know he's not a really good example for me that is why you know I think\nPeople judge it on the merits and say look\nIf you you supported Trump for one issue in particular has sort of an issue based reason that's one thing but but it's rather bizarre like when people have challenged on yeah you said look you know what do you think about Trump\nPraising white nationalist in Charlotte Charlottesville very high people he said you know if I was going to leave America for the races all over the last a long time ago I mean that is\nTo me rather dangerous just wanted to normalize yeah the white nationalist on parade so I you know I I kind of get it but I'm Sorry that I'm not just going to play my violin ... west\nYou know what he you know the fact is is that Trump is a very divisive person and he's the vice it and what Trump is devices have salt in what he does and communist or supplies so you know what if you can't take it that don't do it\nAnd we want your calls at eight hundred to two to five to do to be able to comment on these issues were happy to hear from you again that's eight hundred to two to five to ... to talk to the universe and\nWho the integration I beg your pardon a former U.S congressional candidate democratic political analyst\nAnd we were talking about a Jim Brown khaki coming to visit the White House we're talking about informal comments that Mr Trump made\nA outside the White House on his way I guess to Iowa where there's going to be another another a sort of campaign rally or there and campaign rallies or rally again tonight or in in this little in this little side of the campaign though I guess so to disappear are\nYeah yeah I agree\nBut but uh he mentioned ... and ... and really getting behind that as a biofuel as a fuel um he's also going to end this was again this impromptu little press coverage he also said he was going to increase oil refineries or they're going to be any pushback on these issues\nAre looking at like Hi Chuck Grassley Chuck Grassley runs the Senate Judiciary committee\nHe's a Republican senator from Iowa he loves those subsidies because that's corn growers so he's like thank you Mr President so these are he is just he is speaking to the\nThe Republican base at all when\nWe started during the first time I get that\nYeah that makes sense to me however the refinery thing was sort of uh we've we've had a shortage of oil refinery in this country for decades and it takes three to five years to get a refinery up and going\nWould view as anybody having a public conversation about this and what that's going to be with us going to look like and how that fits with the pipelines and the natural gas policies or is there an oil is there a ... interview policy evolving here do we think\nIs there any policy of our I mean I I mean right I mean you've got you've\nGot the guy Rick Perry running a department that he said when he ran for president that he would eliminate he wouldn't eliminate the cabinet position that he fills okay said like I think that tells you everything you need to know about Trump's

whole thing is going to be frozen and audited which is the right thing to do a but it does not sound like it's going to be ready for a prime time for the election which is fascinating\nYeah I mean I

eight hundred to two to five to to to go now to Jane right now and go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah I heard that got you're just talking with state that Trump praised white supremacists and I don't think that it's accurate I think what he said was something along the lines of there are good people on both sides of the S.\nTo um [noise] you know he also then denounced a white nationalism and racism and all that other kind of stuff so I really feel that you miss interpret or miss represent his words is part of what's going on with it\nThat division and the country\nThat people like the woman that Dr whatever her name was racing um was is trying to foment anger by misrepresenting it she carries she and people like her carry tremendous responsibility for the rage that we're seeing\nSo so let's break down what I I've looked at that footage in retrospect and what he was asked was\nAbout the people on both sides of Charlottesville of the statue controversy people wanting to take down the statue versus defend the statue and it was in the wake of in the wake of but he said that he was asked about the statues\nAnd he said the statues are good people on both sides and I want to wait to see the till the sorts out what it got interpreted as good people on both sides and then he came out and said white supremacist I condemn them why would they condemn them if he was also saying they're good people\nBecause we've seen it and he was not saying that they were good\nPeople there are other people who are not white supremacist who don't agree with taking down historical monument\nRight so it was about the it was about the controversy over the monuments exactly not over the NATO or whether it be the rally that happened\nI Can't speak for Dr ... and she's no longer with us um but what I Believe she was responding to was why people took issue with Kanye West that the people that were angry at him for supporting the president sees the president as supporting white supremacy in some capacity but she was and he\nDoes it and there is no evidence of that and she followed face lied and should\nHave been called out on it a lot of people seem to think that a shame that that Trump praised white supremacists the outage so lately did not that that is it not allow that I I heard\nIt too and I kind of let it go and you're right I I'm aware of the fake news element in that uh I I mean I don't know but it but it would it goes to though when it goes to a is a discussion that I keep wishing we would have is the difference between racism and racially insensitive but if I don't think we ever really\nGet to you know by my wrong and I learned as it is that a ... is that just a word on\nI think what we have seen in certain times Trump is about publicly has lent a wink wink nod nod to a certain faction\nOf white supremacists and so many of his critics believe that yeah he does not take a harsh stance against them and when he got rightly condemn all he had come to many of his followers\nA with respect to California and um the problems with motor voter at the federal election level as well so let's let's let's see how serious a you know California leaders I looked\nAt any has way says we are talking to assemblyman Jim patterns and if this was a private company it would be completely out of business yeah something kind of not were just or we will find try and fix the leaks here and I\nUnderstand that I Am but also understand that the [noise] the the software company that is at the heart of some of this has been very very generous to the to the Democratic party in\n... Wisconsin ... would cut contribution All right so ... to ...\nUh we we have to I'm forgetting who moved to the break your assignment of I'm Sorry but where's that be worse than the average citizen go or ... how do you know the what do we do have really yeah first\nOf all I think every citizen in California the column the governor's office and say free ... did you get this is too serious secondly call or the DMV office\nOr that may be problematic at the lines are built so called your local member of the California legislature or senator or your assembly member original concerned about this they have\nResources like we do to get to the DMV quickly on on their behalf in fact we're processing dozens of problems right now the DMV with constituents in my area and so I elected representatives

ate the more we continue to educate so not what you're saying that the ball you think people like myself I'm not a victim coming off of that Democrat plantation I don't want to do that anymore that what you're saying and I absolutely loved it\nAnd how about the care of it on your did you have any feelings or thoughts about that\nFirst of all when I looked at the Fort I looked at the shovel hand

six to seven percent of the ... of the of the black vote now I was kind of half way for him because I wanted to go with the devil I don't know as opposed to the devil I Do which is ... well let me say this this man\nBamboozled even me he said that black men all the football field SOB and do not deserve to be in this country he also said that wasn't Maxine Waters or the other lady with a\nCowboy hat

black people that I Know and I know a bunch of them they do not support Donald Trump because he very disrespectful and dedicated to black people\nThat's all we know that disrespectful and this is I think that's the key I think you're right I I keep saying that there's something about\nThe ... the disrespect or so that that he's just simply ignorant on racial issues you know any better I think it's kind of intentional\nWinkler to his white base what are you know\nHe wasn't ignorance\nOn the west Virginia so committed all let 'em\nKill it and I said that uh\nJune June will not replace us and land in any way our land running around with torches and say\nWell some of them are good people easy enough to be disrespectful when not to be disrespectful would even when it comes to the immigrants
