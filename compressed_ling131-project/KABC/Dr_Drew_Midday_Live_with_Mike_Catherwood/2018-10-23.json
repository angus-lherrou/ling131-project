I'm calling for Senator Bob Menendez I mean that's a horrible bread yes and they fell for it and they called me back and he said well\nWe don't just say one thing why is your cell phone eight one eight if\nIf you were in uh Jersey uh you know kind of you know a senator and and I said it's because we're on a holiday and within two hours Lawrence within two hours Jared Kushner called me from air force one amazing and then I talked to Donald Trump about immigration reform and about the Supreme Court justice ... and look\nLook he I mean I have a bad Long Island accent I knocked down a senatorial I sound janitorial we've got to get jak involved with\nDrugs I Know I went out and so she'll probably less than ... going to give him ... over the Long Island accent but she she didn't really get almost ... almost one in\nNorth shore of all north south to a guy really Huntington but I ended up buying a house in ... I live right on right now and that guy how they run into each other at the wall man\nShe looked like you and yeah that really curly hair and taller because she's beautiful beautiful one man yeah I was glad that you're letting our listeners now\nSay something law and that's why I was suffering in the beginning was when I was a beautiful woman she overwhelm me nervous [laughter]\nI have at uh All right well John our number is eight hundred to two to five to do to we're going to start the conversation about the mid term election after the break here we're also going to have an attorney RJ my ... I'm catching the ...\nIs it is it is I I Know for sure and talk to you you're pretty handsome suggested they makes me nervous have shut up one argument where we\nAre talking about the Trump Administration considering the of the nation of the transgender identification there was at all me again our number is eight hundred to two to five to to to be also a friend who's the merits coming at the second our third are rather talk about why nine people are suing the scooter industrial are going to get into the scooter thing and we're gonna defend it right\nThe guy and I'm all about school\nLawrence of odds are truth but I have a talk radio seven Ninety KBC it'll take a break some news which we don't [noise]\n... got issues with the election those\nShapiro encouraging you even right here in California\nNo way to get some\nYour commonsense election headquarters ABC Los Angeles Orange County a cumulus station\nABC News as live and local at one o'clock I'm Jeff with a restaurant owner is hoping to cash in on the lotto fever\nThat sweeping so Cal by giving away free lottery tickets jak hall says the catch is you have to come into cafe two to tango today in order\nSomething that you could actually see the bipartisan trend is these familiar names that people I think kind of take for granted way like I mentioned Bob Menendez New Jersey think about Ted Cruz of Texas He's struggling I mean he's probably going to win but he's having a heart\nNow Trump pen yeah he hit a new nickname the fed\nOut at ... the guy who said his father\nMurder JFK rat and it's so why at the\nEnd he needs the president there to give him a little sugar high at the end so I think\nReally what you're seeing what I what I might suggest here is there is an anti establishment\nWave that that you're seeing that anger for it right and so someone like Gavin Newsom is very much consider to be a part of the establishment and I was a very\nYou know versus a John Cox who's a little bit more of an outsider he's wrong with his own problems Cox's but he's he's at least consider to be an outsider same thing with ... in Texas right he's an outsider Andrew Gillum is considered an outsider a buy a lot of people in the political process so I think\nThe place to be is to not be in the establishment um and I know that very well the former Hillary Clinton staffer\nAmericans owner who who's not necessarily um swayed by identity politics not necessarily a plane by her by her party\nDo you think those who voted for Trump in twenty sixteen aren't looking in a different direction for these midterms or do you think those who voted for him had dug in her mind behind him\nThings that are lining\nConventional wisdom says that the president always is going to lose a blue some level of support in the midterms right but President Trump does it look I I'm no fan of President Trump but he's made an interesting strategic play here because he's nationalize the selection\nAnd he's made them about him so he's saying is you're not just voting for Ted Cruz you're voting for me\nRight that's what bronco bomber tried to do it twenty sixteen it didn't work and frankly I think it's what a lot of candidates do what they try to nationalize that they try to make it a referendum on them you're not voting for candidate Republican candidate ex\nYou're voting for Donald Trump you're not we're voting for Democrats ex you're voting for Barack Obama now whether or not\nPresident Trump can be more successful than others in the past like him have been you know we have two weeks to see whether that's going to be realized but it's a it's an interesting strategic play by the president to go all in on that because given where his numbers are you wouldn't think that that will be an effective way but you know this president I'm often has overcome a conventional wisdom\nNot feeling certainly am not going to yeah I think\nBecause you don't see Republicans coming out against him so I have to assume everybody until the next election happening is going to play like Trump's roles\nWell and look if you're the president and you set the rules okay no matter if you're a conventional president or an unconventional president\nEven if you're an unpopular president even if you're at a popular program that go along with that if you're up for reelection and\nI Am I'm being a bad Democrat here by by citing positive things for Donald Trump but I Will say this I mean the latest Quinnipiac numbers have seen I think it was Quinnipiac was that Trump to forty seven percent of approval which is essentially were block Obama was um at this time of his presidency so\nThere has been a hardening of that Trump base behind him um the numbers that were stuff you know a matter of a muffin lots of the effort go have gotten stronger now is that just Republicans returning is that Republicans who are going to stay home kind of getting energized or that those independents or potential\nDemocrats who have crossed over right who who are saying hey or who who would have stayed in their lane saying I'm going to come back home that Donald\nTrump is it is it but here's a here's my question is I really can't tell\nThat the one that one piece of this but I Can't help but feel the Democrats they they played every card\nInto the Republicans a playbook by through the Kavanaugh saying which ... fears are I think motivate fear in frustration is motivating Republicans\nNow so they they put the Kavanaugh saying created a stir in in Trump's base now you have you had some mob behavior that freaked everybody out and now you actually have a mob coming up through Mexico this this is like everyone I Know it was a Republican is just exercise by these things\nThey they they are not going to not vote they can't wait to get in a day and so that's all democratic created and all of it\nWell I I don't know if I quite agree with that doctors but what what I Would say is is I mean you've got the president out here and I even hesitate to repeat this because it's not true talking about he's going to give tax cuts okay congressman session I Know into at least late November I\nNot only that but it might even talking about that as far as I Know policy on that ... majority of Republicans believe those tax cuts went to the rats\nHere's what I mean like I wasn't saying don't worry matter in the middle class when next time why would you believe in it doesn't\nMatter but but Lauren here's the problem here at the Trump reality it doesn't matter that what he's saying it's B. S. it matters that he's saying it and and what did you see the last two days Trump promises tax cuts for the middle class yeah ... ... ... so he plays the media to essentially give them two days of recovery\nTall man about effects that are getting into not going to actually be able to pass your tips or ... or\nJoin I Would I Want to give people a chance to call him by the eight hundred to two to five or I Do too which is a Trump is playing the addicted media they're addicted to him like a like a Stradivarius I mean they know that I think it'd be a record everything I say well here's something outrageous that will play to my face and you see a doctor\nThat I think is the story look you're talking about Democrats actually think Democrats are being smart and what they're talking about it might get headlines about you know a quote unquote mob um things like that but really what Democrats are honing in on is health care that's the dominant issue even over the economy writ large yeah health care and that's what Democrats are talking\nAbout but but that's a hard and that's not really want to do anything to the media right as a hard one to create\nA headline around and it's a difficult issue and it's challenging as complex and had to get people to understand it I did a um healthcare panel over the weekend at a political ... I was done to the sort of lack of understanding and the unwillingness to sort of be realistic about it it was it was stunning frankly well\nI don't I don't think people who are talking about pre existing conditions I don't even think they understand what they're saying when they say that right because right how can you be for protecting it's pretty good conditions we don't understand that you also have to be for the individual mandate in order for that to actually work\nWith it and I also learned economic yeah well yes but let's just let's be let me say something clear and outlaw\nThat the the elimination or the the empowering people with pre ... pre existing condition to get insurance\nWas a rest taking improvement breathtaking I must have I was the the advocate for people trying to get insurance they couldn't it was heartbreaking I'll hand you know it's not much of that one when the margin has had a breathtaking effect on human being so there's I\nI think it's wonderful that that now people want to be on that train but one do they actually understand what\nThat means or the soldiers Donald Trump understand that when he goes and lead an effort to take away the individual mandate okay a year or so ago that he essentially makes that impossible to say I support\n'em you know ... the insurance markets will tell you that insurance companies are going to just run up to cost a premium right if you do that because you have to have the mandate in order to make\nA pre existing conditions piece work\nHe tells me that as long as we're going down the health care how do you mind if I asked this question because I don't understand why they haven't really taken aim at insurances and they're\nThe means by which they're there to profitability and their rapacious says financial institutions I don't understand why they're allowed to maintain big bond funds that have nothing to do with health care\nI don't understand why they're allowed to have these huge salaries and bonuses all of that is mandated mandated to health care I die because your private sector hill I understand but there there is something it'd be when we talk about insurance reform I don't\nKnow about banking reforms lie to bankers have the same type of counting weed\nBut it doesn't affect the insurance industry actually I don't believe\nThat as a matter of you know maybe you're talking about well Congress and no no I'm not I'm Talking about insurance laws but go ahead\nNo what all I was gonna say with I think something that's not well covered is at the very beginning of that Obamacare health care discussion the insurance companies all said will come to the table and the reason why that was significant as because that was them essentially saying okay we give up will will be ... we're going to be inside the tent we're not going to be outside the tent you know when there's a part of that deal\nA deal was made to guarantee them a certain amount of\nCourse it was a very important part of

I think they they want to have more control over federal funding and he's\nA based on a based on their qualifications of the of the people that are applying for a health funding and things like that I I don't know the exact details of it because obviously\nIt hasn't been released but I my understanding is this is the funding issue and it would make sense doctors you because as you know the president has come across the fiscally conservative person and as I said I really don't think this is really about gender identity I just think it's about politics or money or not the right wing base to uh you know because the\nCurrent he's also firing up the left wing base right there is yet another ... civil rights issue that they need to contend with against this president\nYeah I Would argue might ... the sort of common sense approach would be to manage it as you do other medical issues that may have it fall in line with the standard of care\nOr as it pertains to you know limiting expense and purchasing you know in cooperatives and whatnot just make it like everything else and and if you don't make it something that can have extraordinary you know unlimited expense then don't pay I I to me it just seemed like well doctored yeah\nGo ahead Dr too it's not just about the medical I think I think we got to go to the politics of it I think the Trump Administration doesn't want the transgender community to have a civil rights action for discrimination from getting fired and these are just\n... a whole different matter events like they just I mean you are getting my eyes to all the legal yeah I mean we just think of it hey you feel that you feel like go ahead and bed by their dad had seemed to be a lot of legal ramifications around yeah oh yeah and uh\nFor example if I if I get fired and I'm transgender do I have a right to sue based on the fact that I'm transgender the laws on the right now on that\nInteresting RJ thank you again the website\n... dot com as always thank you Dr ...\nThank you sir eight hundred to two to five to to to learn spawn doctor drill return your calls have been alive\nNow how does the homeowner discovered that his or her home insurance\nPolicy is outdated well when something breaks and their policy doesn't cover it right sixty four percent of American households are under insured with outdated coverage that is what hit both set out to solve\nWith smart home insurance for the modern home for up to twenty five percent less than right now when you switch to hippo they'll give you a smart home starter care with too smart sensors that help prevent break ins water leagues and fires\nAnd you also get a smart home discount offering coverage for\nAll the items that runs your home like everything that plugs into the wall\nFor up to twenty five percent less\nTakes seconds an all policies are backed by hit both top rated insurance partners with over two hundred\nBillion in assets go to my hip boat dot com HI PPO my hip ... dot com slash through and see if you can save up to twenty five percent\nPlus getting smart home started yet that is my hip bowed dot com slash true go there today in sixty seconds you could say twenty five percent of my hippo dot com HI PPO my hip out dot com slash through\nThe you know how old your water heater is most water heaters only last about ten years in Seventy percent of our water heaters get replaced an emergency\nThat's not exactly convenient what his convenient this at the Home Depot have the most advanced green water heaters with the latest technology\nViewers is about ten years old it's time for an upgrade in time to get a re water during peace of mind including\nSome African Union only from the Home Depot for saving\nResults me very notice solicitation for legal services view oh the IRS taxes payroll taxes have not filed you return the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one called to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nClients settles for about ten percent of what his old we offer free face to face consultations in your local area called eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three\nAnd now your window into the world of widow route you buy will schooling studios were faculty has access to build upon the best curriculum and pedagogy from throughout the world the u._k.

here we're talking about the movement to [noise]\nI I again it's very confusing to me it it seems like the mission is wanting to limit the financial resources that are dedicated to the care and

on what I'm saying is your transgender\nYou're going for medical care to help train make your transition should the provider have unlimited resources at their disposal to do either to provide those services and let me just say that does not exist anywhere else in medicine under any conditions for any disorder\nSo I understand that he's saying that he's saying they want to limit those resources they've been released resources strictly for the Oregon for the for the medical treatment\nOf surgery exactly we're not even they're\nNot being specific ... it's it's in the military in the VA in the

defective looters named misty being a collapse does not help her in any meaningful way right into the you know for me\nSo if you trip over them now and they happened to be clearing the sidewalk is that\nLaurie great point that's what that is also brought up in this lawsuit there's two points that were made that there are there are a public nuisance because they are a tripping hazard for passers by and also there's another allegation that they block certain a handicap\nAccessible area handicap accessible parking so all of those I mean look I just I balled I I I used a scooter I thought it was great for the purposes of of you know getting around\nAnd environmentally friendly and all that but I Will say I was surprised that how haphazardly they were strewn around here in New York sweep the city bikes right that's\nThat's ... yeah\nWould say the closest we don't have the suitors and yet I Know that there is talk of that uh as far as the rights\nProgram we have the city bikes but you know there's these docking stations and the docking stations are in specific places and the bikes have to go back to the doctor stations or they're serious fines I noticed that it was all seem to be a little different uh they're that they're just seem to be kind of like piles of suitors are free\nTo do that but there is but it's not the only their piled up and then they just accumulated over time\nLiterally you get picked up again you need your app tells you where they are and they get picked up the news again and when they run out of Jews there's a there's a whole line of business of people just go around and pick up scooters and recharge them sure industry now people\nYou know and that makes sense and you know what it is it's not necessarily that you need to say that these are banned you know it's certainly a great idea there's absolutely liability that's going to come with any sort of ride sharing type\nProgram right I mean that that's inevitable the question is do there need to be more regulations we you know as as being at the ... cities towns whatever you need to come up with ways to make it safer and regulate and with anything of course it takes a while for those laws to catch up with\nThe issues that come in and that kind of comment and an almost anything right\nYeah yeah no no I understand it whenever there's there was a technological advances laws that follow him and we they they are not there and at first they they fall after the fact is we find out you know the liabilities associated with the application right oh jeez\nLearned I learned was an early adopter and we had a ... America official surgeon and here it was just\nAbsolutely who was that everybody just went up forty percent yard\nParticularly manageable fractures before fractures are global fractures and and I know my Arthur friend's arms ... charm of just get your face 'cause your arm went out in front and then it's an arm an elbow fracture and uh I may be it occurred to me that the\nSome public education or even in that liability form some real specific advice about exactly what the liabilities are in other words these are the common injuries from operating this vehicle I don't think I think to me that's a reasonable thing for the company to have to put out there and I don't think they do\nKnow I I think that's absolutely a reasonable thing also maybe some more insight as to proper operation and use a of of the scooter or ... absolutely those are all very reasonable conclusions and you know\nMany many times now there's there's a flurry of these lawsuits there right so this is the first class action that we're seeing got Milwaukee seeking an injunction against the companies you know we see private lawsuits like this one get one plane tests quite frequently where the plaintiffs says\nI was hit by somebody on a scooter and\nWho are they going to go after the person driving the scooter or the\nCompany or going after the company because that's the that's where the money but uh\nTo the extent that you have the ride share programs Dr true what you suggest is is a reasonable way to to for a company to say hey look we are acting reasonably we we are looking at public safety seriously and when you have a loss it like this you can go back and point to those\nFactors role is what we're doing to make sure that people are using our product correctly and that they're safe and as\nCompared to you know again we're you won the we want which the consumer once tried to make the consumer wants these things we want to be able to protect their ability to use these scooters\nAnd I would argue that the city by the New Yorker kind of a bust I don't want to ride those things are don't identify the place to put it that scooters just somebody take a short distance\nTotally it's the greatest gift to subways I really like I Will say leave under drought or somebody else will get it from a different city by which I have never used and so I worry appealing about these ... and if we really are serious about creating alter\nNot only that you should not take a little liability why I Love riding a bike for exercise but if I Need to get somewhere and look good in Southern California it's not a good ... transfer from an sweaty when I got there\nThe scooter I'm just within around in high heels I'm great\nYeah yeah well you said you know what a lot of these lawsuits most of the time they settle right a lot of the vast majority settle and with that what you'll see is new regulations moving forward I you know here in New York for instance we just talked about the city bags\nWell you know they they're with their popularity they created more bike lanes here and part of that was to avoid a lot of people riding\nOn forty second street on the popular in the city\nBy the cause I I nearly get hit by a bike every time I step into those claims particularly wrong you know midtown\nYeah and I never nearly hit by a city bike it's always the guys with the whistles and helmets that are literally it that way and if\nI get cut off I'm not but I'm not pay by Citi Bike to get it wrong but I just biking itself\nBut I think you will see more regulations that are looking to make this a very great business idea great for you know residents to make it a little bit safer\nI knew I wanted to before I let you go and ask a quick aside and this was again I'm always unfair when a bomb Russia with this stuff before you came when we were we were doing a lot of thinking about the administration being part leaking in a memo where they were contemplating limiting\nThe definition of transgender a from a legal standpoint and at first we thought it was them trying to limit the amount of expense that they were going to have to use to to treat people with transgender issues but now it's sounding like they're trying to make transgender strictly speaking\nI don't know why no longer a legal Miller a legal term it really just your gender is something to find by your sex chromosomes and art ... it would seem weirder because well\nI I don't know how to how we exactly what they're going to do what do you have any opinion about this and what that is likely to do if there's if they succeed\nYeah well I think that what you're what you're saying it's certainly the direction that it's going in and that's really bad and ah that's been the mentality from the Republican standpoint not everybody but from the far right for quite some time it's your birth certificate right that's the\nThat's the you know now it's virtually because the New York and California you can put X. in there you go back and not have the right as\nWell and and states and and and transgender rights are protected in both New York city in California specifically so ... and ... in other states there's all more encompassing a mortar it'll sink terms\nThen what would what would someone in California what would happen to them if this goes through and the Trump Administration narrowly defined gender as what is on your birth certificate hand that need that ...\nSo that would impact the federal law so the federal baseline gives ... states can only give more protections than what the federal law get so hung up the issue would probably not be in California Saturday issue would be in a in a state with less ah all encompassing\nLess tangible laws are yeah productions yeah so we're getting\nBack into this issue it seems like there's a really almost a radical states' rights moved going on as it pertains to so many of these rights and privileges that people value right\nYeah and I think look realistically that issue that's something that you would ultimately the the Supreme Court decide\nOr boy what am I yeah yeah because ... I mean from a standpoint of sort of general agreement I mean nobody disagrees that there's a biological gender and there's a live gender and that lived genders ... multiplicity of factors that as complex\nOr and it may or may not be related to your biological gender\nAnd you know to go sort of defining it narrowly legally I just think that's going a bit too far or ... or ... two categories like biological gender and live gender or something like that does that make sense\nYeah no absolutely does but remember these are these memos so it doesn't necessarily mean that will come to fruition the prospect that that would be the administration's agenda not too surprising but whether or not that would actually happen or if it's a farther down the road\nBut I Do completely understand what you're saying and I think I I I think everybody would agree that that\nThat's my point that everybody would agree that's the thing that we're sort of at this point\nI don't know if somebody's trying to place and then what if it sounds brain that are used on the trees or what it is but dogs and getting say\nSeveral dog owners reported their pets suffering from diarrhea and even seizures West Hollywood officials had contacted the LA county department of animal services do an official investigation has yet to be launched James Rojas KABC news\nWell a vintage plane crash landed on the one oh one been through a freeway and a gory hills about a half hour ago but the pilot manage to get out safely\nJust as the aircraft was catching fire the plane hit the center divider area did burst into flames looked like one wing had been at least partially torn off from TV footage that crash a no vehicles were involved though so it landed on the freeway by itself\nFortunately that pilot as we mentioned was able to walk away now burglary suspect was arrested today after being discovered hiding inside Burton elementary school in ... officers went to the campus around five AM when an alarm sounded and found that man hiding in the crawl space above the auditorium\nThat according to LA us the school police the suspect was taken into custody following a standoff in LA city firefighters had to help bring that man down to safety is expected to be booked on suspicion of burglary and investigators are working to determine if he was involved in other recent burglaries at that same school\nAnd a man was rescued from the side of a nine story building an Anaheim this morning the construction worker was on a platform outside the seventh floor\nWhen the motorized platform malfunction leaving him dangling from his safety rope for about an hour it was finally rescued by firefighters just before nine AM and was not injured talk radio seven Ninety\nABC for the world series kicks off this afternoon in Boston\nThat's where the Dodgers were battles the red Sox game one of the fall classic two teams last met in the world series of Nineteen sixteen clippers visit New Orleans this afternoon while the kings skate in Dallas today and the duct tape in Colorado this afternoon that sports on seven Ninety K.
