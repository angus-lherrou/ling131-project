understand that people have darker skin have to deal with a lot all day every day but ... if you if you dressing up right even if you took it all in and took all their new account\nYou still get tick

time Warner center when I was there\nWe uh regularly had drills or like this ah for an evacuation for just such a an occasion you know every every couple of months and and to have it be real I mean if you're watching CNN\nYou were seeing poppy Harlow and John ... a anchoring and talking about the uh explosive devices that were intercepted by the secret service before they reach for Iraq Obama and Hillary Clinton and then suddenly\nA very loud alarm went off in the background and that was a signal for people to evacuate to get out and I'm very frightening moments for the folks in in the entire Time Warner center not just the CNN up by the way to you or your during the press conference at the police department\nAre they're very proactive and when it comes to um educating people and mail rooms about threats are in and that grew out of the anthrax scare\nPost nine eleven when when letters containing anthrax were delivered to a several news organizations so they had two members of the counterterrorism hum hum department to counter terrorism unit in the mail room at the time Warner center\nEducating employs about what to look for a for these devices that are similar to what George Soros a received a couple of days ago when this package addressed to the former CIA director Brennan was discovered in that mail room\nWhile that how crazy is amazing yeah yeah the whole thing is crazy now clearly one source right we just don't know who or what the motivation is right\nWe don't know the motivation we don't know who who it is you know there are ... there's there's a lot of speculation out there and and and you really need to\nBe cautioned against Vicki leading what this could be I mean clearly there is a similarity between these people some of them are very loud vocal critics of President Trump and others are very uh active supporters of progressive causes\nA but that's that's it that's all we know that you know the the similarities that these targets have and uh and that it appears to be a according to federal authorities like these devices all a came from the same origin because they bear some similarities\nHit hit ... am I right that they not only evacuated the CNN building a Columbus Circle there in the back of the whole block is it true you know I\nI was there for a while um and there were a lot of people out on the street or there were still people in the condos at the time water center these are too you know fifty five story towers that right over Central Park and\nThen they didn't evacuate the condos initially did they did you know tell people if they left they couldn't go back in ... but uh other aspects you know the mall that's they're the ... mall yeah that that was evacuated um and and my colleagues you know\nThey they they actually set up a bureau out on the street eventually while they were unable to to work inside the building and we're we're seeing a bureau outside it was essentially what they were doing\nPolice in sunrise Florida we're investigating and that one of the packages that was sent to democratic ah represented Danny Debbie Wasserman Schultz um it was intercepted before it ... it got to her office but what I found interesting about that was the return address lead her own address\nYeah this is the interesting thing is I mean it actually got back to her office because of that return address it wasn't it was not initially address to her oh dear wow that's a weird thing as well in in this and and again there's there's so many\nPeople out there you know throwing around theories about what this could be in some of them are quite out outlandish and and again we we really have to caution against speculation here and and just let\nHis book is Donald drain the swamp a children's book\nOr he's going to talk

like not paint them with any kind of brushing just\nYet of what what are we going up all the people that are on the ... and ... wouldn't be you know I just you know we need to some way to ... block them all and block anybody who violate aren't we take a lot of uh you know such a thing or is it distributed everywhere [laughter]\nI just I I yeah I Know it gets Eli really down and depressed and you just see the constant day in day out back and forth\nI totally agree and it's all silo to people here are their own echoes and it's it's bad times so we're going to seek\nTo Sam Nunberg remember him a form of either yeah he's got to talk about the upcoming elections and what's likely for his standpoint going to go on there and the bottom of the hour we have a Eric my taxes he\nHas a book is called Donald drained the swamp it's a children's book well it may or may not at all is it I Can't decide if it is okay to the chosen by looks like a children's book and I I ... it has something to do with the\nCaravan and the border and the ball and I don't I don't quite get where he'd go with it but I I'm sure he'll be happily tell us a once we get him up here in our number here eight hundred to two to five to to do any of the theories are and what the profile of individual might be to perpetrate something\nLike this man oh out there and I think you're I have yet to find I think there are ... bomber that's a great question has ever been a female yeah a female serial murderers are sharing really wherever they exist\nAnd it's never somebody that just is sort of has a political agenda it's a sick person or is are the horse and of course it's a person\nUm but they usually have a political agenda yeah true eight hundred to two to five to two is that phone number a Lars von ... this is talk of Ninety KBC will take will break for some news with Jeff widow\nCountries got issues [noise]\nGet out and vote on election day Tuesday November ...\nShapiro encouraging you even right here in California [noise] no\nWay to get some\nCommonsense election headquarters ABC Los Angeles Orange County a cumulus station [noise]\n'kay ABC News is live and local at one o'clock I'm Jeff ... President Trump denounced today the delivery of suspected pipe bombs to Hillary Clinton former president Barack Obama CNN's New York bureau Eric Holder and others\nBut you don't get that far but it seems to me like that sort of the paradigm case\nExactly and you don't have to go do it but I feel like with the message that we are getting that are becoming more mainstream\nThis honestly level it's sort of like this is the way to solve the problem as opposed to you know people to go\nEdition of disgusted and get to a mutual understanding people are utilizing threats of violence or just various forms of aggression as a way to try to come to some kind of understanding about something they don't agree with and I do think that that's becoming more pervasive so if something doesn't happen\nFrom the top were were discouraging these messages accurately\nRolled out its ... I'm going to the ... based on the picture you we're painting\nAnd you only historical antecedent back and point to in this country is like Eighteen sixties\nAnd there was a massive change from the top or a president came in and it was specifically trying to acquiesce the angry party which was a new Lincoln and it did not do any good\nSo my ... it makes me think is are you predicting here that we're going to see a Harpers Ferry tardy outbursts of some sort of\n... organized and violence ah and then that's going to really resonate throughout the country I mean that's if you were saying that we're rolling down the hill towards violence well there has been a historical period where we did that and what really broke it open was Harpers Ferry\nAre a lot of people say we are in the same type well I I learned I Do divided\nI Hope not but but at the ... clear but but go ahead and make your case\nWell and you know to to both eager points yeah lord and I think a lot of people that we might be going down that road and I think that that's a possibility right we have to stop it before it gets there I don't want that to be sort of the sighting of that that that allows\nYou know the powers that be to say what we eat to actively do something completely different and we can't even\nIn some abstract way be encouraging us to some degree and I I Do think that the the current administration does need to take a little bit more into their own hands at this point and say maybe there's some messages that were putting out there that's encouraging\nYou know almost like if you don't like something to do something about it and doing something doesn't have to be sort of like I mean I'm saying that the judge but like a letter writing campaign like we don't need to do that we just go right to the top but we make it happen on her own and some of that and that's it it's getting distorted I think yeah and\nBut the head of a letter writing the advantages go on Twitter and put something on blast and and you know for the firing of whoever they don't like or wherever you're going\nTo say yeah they don't yeah so we're using that technique of violence which the Russians yeah ... and uh we don't realize we're doing the same damn thing but here we are\nAnd if you know the the people who are unhappy with President Trump have been super clear that they will not come themselves until President Trump's out of office or soy him saying anything I don't imagine there's any possibility of him calming anybody down real\nI don't think he will come everybody down but I feel like there are all again this is took the conversations with\nPeople who are you know following\nTrump's supporters of truth they do really use him as an adult and they will say well it's a permanent so why not okay for me right and\nHe said it wasn't that he is ... come out and says the boxes but there's really two\nOh I'm Glad that the fact that I never saw fan right hung out against bombings but he ... someone who who assaulted a record or I mean ... ...\nHere Judy who's Lawrence of autos a moderate unwilling to listen to everything from the top because it's not even\nWilling to listen I'm saying that you have to get you would have to be an insane person at the price of the United states not come out today and say we do know people don't bomb ...\nPoint is I'm but I'm not I'm not criticizing him for being that why I'm saying he's he is created too much acrimony for people to take it seriously that way and I'm so yes yes and so again I I Am just gravely concerned about things I'm hoping that we're not rolling down the hill to violence I'm hoping that\nThere are you kidding me that there there's no reason\nThat that people are being targeted by these rallies that you'd be peaceful demonstrations are turning into out now brawl I mean right if you've been reading about going on with Democrats crowd wave you had a democratic leader now calling for islands\nThat the Proud Boys or a group of a white Caucasian American males who who are in the need for for starting fights at these types of rally I mean\nWe're at a at a press at his right now we're seeing this is just a powder keg and and I don't know that civil war I'm I'm worried that one of these bombs is going to be real one day and it's going to do real damage because people are yell fire it up and tightly wound right now and\nIt sounds like some of these are just poorly bill right I mean they might actually be real bumpy than they're just not theirs didn't go off right I mean at least a couple of them is legit it's unclear\nI mean he he heard a doctor do hurt I Am experts saying that he believed that these were just made to look like devices I heard a different afterward this morning they just they were working devices they just weren't that lean whatever\nThis guy said they were working devices that weren't\nIntended to go off well how how are they working to light and they didn't put a timer or whatever they were on\nHold on to do what you want to answer you know now that we're I mean to this point I feel like the perfect meal at least in my life\nIn my lifetime yeah thank you um I wasn't there for the civil rights movement in the fifties I think right now but in my lifetime they've definitely field as divided as an Asian it's ever felt to the point where you can no longer talk about certain things in public because you do not know the reaction of your audience\nThat's been going on for a long time\nBut not like this not like this not since since Trump has been in office\nI write to die by the last time I met a couple of years yeah yeah yeah I agree with your right right I I I don't know I I feel like there's a possibility of this could you do if we could wake us up out of our community the wonderful and we got out of this and go oh come on really we're going that's where we'll just\nAlthough yeah mayor of Los Angeles started stirring it up a little bit right away and we need our political were all to go hey we're politicians we disagree does not time for violence we have another word that we have another weird thing here too which is all the ammunition is on the left it up to our up\nAll the gun Rappler on the right and so that seems like a deterrent to made any real ... up developing but if people then on the other side's are arming up and now we got a problem I don't really know we've got a problem on race\nAnd I'm going to say that the somebody that does this this kind of a horrible act despicable act is a coward is paranoid who had the O's is obviously somebody with a you know stream positions and opinion when who uh\nYou know or who research is that well and are not the Unabomber necessarily but also not you know not some buddy that we would be likely to be engaged and actually the political process I bet somebody when I comment here Judy hang on a second or a judge Judy ... go ahead\nYeah hey hey a statement starts to do a lot of you know I Hope we're not getting to the rolling down the hill towards ... well I don't really believe you because\nYou think I'm hoping rural drug towards ...\nDon't go that\nFar but you continue to and people liking the intended to give Donald Trump pass oh he's a master manipulator use good of you know these inciting violence\nWith his words with his actions are as Lawrence and we said people feel empowered far more than ever before I was told that the president has said\nAnd then people like the world you are listening is really really clear when he's at rallies telling people to watch this guy is radically borrowed it\nNow and blatantly openly racist you know a mortar in recent history that's because they're getting that used on the top end so called it\nIn my opinion you're not really hoping that is because you're labeled it\nWill so how do we get in a way of it are two recommendations\nFor number one we can't it can't be okay for the president of the United states to speak in a way that he does at the very least at every opportunity you have to go into it\nMayor Eric Garcetti says we are living in a toxic environment politically\nYou have a president who uh rallies people are like blood

just really seems like none of these were ever intended to go off you know this is all just for show\nWell that's what that's what I was listening to a security analyst say he was saying the way he would approach this sort of try to figure out who benefits from a scary device that was never intended to go off\nWell if I were to try to harm the Republican Party in such a way this would be a great method of doing so\nSo it so if somebody do you think it's on the left directed at the left again\nSay like I don't want to be conspiracy theory I really I mean they want to sit down that they can be\nReally foolproof plan to go about harming one party or the other right before the election this will be a very simple way to do it but also if this thing was indeed\nHand delivered there's got to be security footage somewhere right that's\nFor all these places and I just have a feeling if we don't see a grainy photo of somebody in the next twelve hours this thing is all fluff\nMeaning what made it wouldn't mean fluff\nFluff if if if the FBI doesn't release a photo of of from security cameras somebody that within the next twelve hours which they're really good at doing for other

goes up against the the nasty swamp creatures are one of whom\nProbably planted these bombs I'm just saying I'm not saying it was Hillary Clinton but uh what your what your guest just said is actually pretty dramatic that some people really are convinced that somebody on the left might have done is that it's so dark I just have to comment on that it's just a stunning\nBut I live in New York City and in New York City\nI have seen actual mobs of people enraged people they they scared me I was walking down Central Park west with my wife and there was a mob of people\nSaying F the cops at the cops led by somebody who looked like he would kill you if given the chance and I thought to myself the irony they're surrounded by cops whom they're cursing and stuff and I thought to myself\nThat is violence that is something that's waiting to happen right there now do I say that everybody on the left is responsible for those maniacs who decided to to march into threatened violence it's just\nNot right and I think no it's not like you said is kind of stuff they just don't like the president makes me and my point ...

Bush um but you saw an organic a rise of the Tea Party and the Tea Party by the way it was a a opposition party against both Democrats and the Bush administration people didn't realize I got tired\nOf people have ah people are very very upset about big government but which that said look I look we can do this on both sides and these things happen I'll just tell you Dr Chu and Lauren I'm consistent I never blamed the politicians on the left of it has to be somebody from the ... we don't even know who these people are ... I never played president\nOr somebody from the light I don't play by anybody for this I think this is check what's going on a story set\nUp I Want to get your focus back to the mid term elections what what's likely to happen when you have any predictions horse\nLook I think that um I Know it was very happy that you invited me back on your show you know in fact for Republicans in California I'm\nThis is the first time since Nineteen eighty eight were Republicans are essentially voting\nIn a presidential election and why do I say that because I think it's Fifteen or fourteen seats I Believe\nThere are a house seat and if you would have told a Republican that looks like they can get out of this mid term\nPossibly only losing one seat like having a net negative one seat um ... you would have said we would have said you were crazy I mean I think that uh the midterms have changed the president took a big gamble and nationalizing them I think he had to I was in meetings\nIn twenty seven ... where people at the ... and see\nPeople on the Republican side I'm obviously a Steve Bannon type I worked for him now where I don't necessarily agree with those folks I I think but you know under there I'm under their approach they mean well but it's a cookie cutter type Republican approaches said look we're going to lose I said they said look we need to run away from the president\nA well hopefully it will pass some taxes because this was before they pass the tax cuts in December will run on the tax cut will run against Nancy Pelosi and I said and I said ladies and\nGentlemen you will lose sixty five seats knowing something like that and the president took this or he's nationalize that and we'll find out what California is one of the most is one of the most important states here are determined he the direction of the mid term I'm\nLucky I Do I Know the California move I think California the life and California's become so bizarre that people are sort of reassessing their political views because I'm really gotten bizarre here and I don't I don't think that as they do with a president proper really don't\nKnow why we see Republicans are former Republicans now joining up for the Democratic party in the Democratic ticket because part of the problem here in California in the left has gone so far overboard with so much that you know the lord Laurence taxpaying citizen
