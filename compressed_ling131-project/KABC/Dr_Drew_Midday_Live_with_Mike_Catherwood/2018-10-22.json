I Do think we we need to have a goal I think as it relates to foreign policy particularly as we are in discussions with the north Koreans right now as we're just somewhat dealing with with Russia although not strong enough from my perspective is very difficult to critiquing challenge what other world leaders\nOr other dictators are doing in other parts of the world if we allow this to go unpunished meeting some type of sanctions you have to be able to send\nA clear message you do this year the diplomatic process through soft power not necessarily hard power to say the United states will draw a clear line of other nations\nCross that line then there will be repercussions if you don't do that this is Kim Jong il and decides to do worse things are ...\nDecided to continue to do worse thing is very very difficult for Republicans which they frequently do that will ... is a horrible person ... it's a horrible person or that's the case how are you guys don't care what Saudi Arabia did you get your trip for for chicken and criticize including and Kim journal\nAnd the other ... when you talk about food and I mean this is a man who there's much more evidence that he has\nDisappeared journalist I Want to use that term that you're an addict turned\nYeah that they have gone missing a multiple journalists sending dozens of them in his country and and with kind of strong ties to the Kremlin and yet we do nothing about that and I mean this one Saturday a citizen he was living here I happen to be right he was\nA resident he was a resident of the United states of the three or four children in the ... I Believe two of them are actual citizens of the United states\nAnd so from my perspective this is much more severe this guy was a resident of this country he lives in his country he played a Saudi Arabia to come and be a part of the Democratic republic that we so uh take\nSerious in this country although I think under the Trump presidency were taken a lot of those norms and values regret it and so for me I think if you are going to allow this to happen to a U.S resident\nUs resident go from some reporting was on the ... in the process at some point to become natural citizen then by what standard by what standard do you do we have as a society as a country to maintain the moral authority\nNot only across the world but within our own nation that we're going to say that it's okay to

on Facebook Watch\nSo dramatically so yes there needs to be some sort of pressure applied and why does it all have three negative let me suggest an alternative and Lauren laughed in my face when I go back\nTo your laughter this time does it get collaborators semi why don't we really got on the pressure machine in a primary pleasure to get the Saudis to recognize Israel and you recognize Israel and will pick the pressure off recognize Israel this is the chance\nYou see this is where it gets really complicated\nBecause you know we do we have decreased our\nReliance on Saudi Arabia as it relates to oil there is still a financial reliance there and I think and and this is unfortunate and we could get into a moral argument about whether this was right or wrong but I Do still believe that we are very dictated by money\nUh and and I love capitalism I think it's a great thing but sometimes capitalism is always and see what morality or what is it ethical\nAnd I find talented but what about is what about recognize Israel, Why can't we turn into a positive and then use that as a way to try to put pressure on Iran then\nSo Dr Drew I don't think we're going to do that because there are other things\nThat they financially that I that I personally believe our leaders in the country are not willing to make that sacrifice because there are benefits\nAs far as armed deals are concerned we also have some military benefits with our partnership with Saudi Arabia and again there's also benefits to oil that would not only attack government but it would also impact private industry and remember private industry has a lot of sway particularly the energy gap that they have a lot of sway Congress so there are a lot of dynamics there that I think\nMembers of Congress including the administration are very well aware of as far as how to try to walk that tight lie in our relationship with Saudi Arabia as we deal with this current situation\nAre not going to share Michael single ten Republican

divided country on this issue where there will be some people including protests were the president who will say well this is what we believe because the Saudis said that and and we have no reason to doubt and\nThen I Believe you'll have a significant portion of the rest of the country including many\nMainstream media outlets that will say well\nWe don't trust this I think you'll have have intelligence officers former intelligence I'll just try it out and said well we've dealt with Saudi Arabia in the past and this story doesn't make sense that they did not know\nWhere we just you know

I've got it both ways on my mother's maiden here but it's still a sailing hurting bill so tell us what's going on here we we talk about this last week\nAnd uh we were having difficulty understanding what our plan is between ... forty seven ... fifty seven and nothing being a felony and now three strikes not being an issue as well either it makes sense as it pertains to drug offenses but there were just wondering where where are we headed with this\nYeah I mean that's research thing it's it's a complicated issue but it's very important so I'll do my best to sort of synthesize that I mean I think you got to start in the beginning what three strikes is three strikes was ... and basically they will\nBut to um deal with career criminals and so they said you know what if you've been convicted of too serious felonies and there's a list of what a series Shelly is it's what\nAny of us would think of as serious Shelley late murder robberies or burglaries\nIf you had two of those and you can get another felony we're going to put you in for twenty five to life because at that point you're just occurred criminal and or in a funny thing happens or the crime rates went way down when we did all that and you know in my experience to prosecute I can tell you it's a small number of people like ... most of the crime sets you can\nIsolate that group we're better off so that um ... we had a proposition to uh make it so that the third strike that search Delaney would also have to be serious or violent felony people were had a stories about someone you know stealing a bicycle out of a garage as if they're striking how they're going to life\nAnd so as a response to that\nThe voters passed prop thirty six\nOr was it has to be serious pilot the problem we have now\nAnd that's why there's all this news about three strikes again is because last month there was a court case in which a someone who is serving a life sentence on a on three strikes um he wanted to be pulled and they said no you won't be pulled into ... which basically said\nAnybody who has not been convicted\nOf a violent if that should be eligible for parole so he um want\nIt to be pulled and the court said you have a right to be and Jerry Brown had promised us that people are three strikes we're not going to benefit from ... fifty seven and now they are\nThat's what this case is about um\nYou know these words serious and violent family they all have difficult means but I Want to do since the start to what this really means what this means is people who are\nServing life sentence on three strikes for non violent offenses are not going to be able to pull this includes people who committed a rape and unconscious person yeah we\nHang on a second bailout holds because he went through this list when we were discussing who was getting out onto the streets about what is a non violent offense as it pertains to the sanctuary city state law which is another group that's getting protection under these these nonviolent\nFelony so let's go through this again I mean it literally means you know beating your wife non violent a fact raping unconscious person non violent affect how is that possible\nBecause they they defined it as violent doesn't mean violent like you and I mean the the legislators when their rights they know what they're doing they looked at the stats of who's in prison and\nDr Drew I'm going to argue that they they work backwards they said okay who's in prison and how do we write this last to get as many people out of prison as possible so they knew that if they included as crimes that you and I would personally think is violent people wouldn't be able to\nGet Jerry Brown campaign and said no new taxes without voter approval they've since gas tax without voter approval without a single Republican vote and they did it because they could\nThey wanted and so you're right but we have the the the voters have to make a decision they got there's got to be

know all of what it's been going on recently with all kinds of reforms that they asked them but we got to do that or if we put more money and he fails than we do in school and that's\nGot to stop that I just think that's a real Bob ...\nWell that's sort of getting out what I was talking about which is we have to distinguish real criminals from people that are sick because that's one way or the door people if you know the ... before\nI got it I think we could do better we put I mean we all spend maybe twelve to two hundred thousand dollars on the people you know and then the the the children in a in the ghetto they don't get them as much money as the children in the suburbs you know per pupil spending\nYou know to say I wish spending reflected necessarily ... you had to sue behind that but I Wish more spending they had a direct relationship with outcomes unfortunately it is not that we've shown over and over and over again when it comes to education so that and he\nFound out they held a\n... right now they are listen but your point is still well taken that we got to do better we always got to do better and I think that's right our number is eight hundred to two to five to ... to we're going to ... we're talking about the caravan and we get back\nThere I don't know if you've seen pictures of this group of people heading up from there started Honduras and now it's kind of looks

going to do with them what we're supposed to be doing with them how do we distinguish people who were legitimize Lee need asylum versus people who I I don't understand what the motive I it's very confusing I noticed really made sense to me in a way that I can understand it but I Do\nKnow what a country and can you show up and bang on the door and say you must let us in the case I mean you generally ... generally while\n... for a while and then and then it was a disaster for them you know what happened to train stations here just overrun with people just coming in and just nowhere to go crime on the rise is ... she has to be orderly whatever it is and it ... and I hope it has to be humane\nBut I don't understand who's coming and why and what we're supposed to do with them I like to know that\nMaybe Brian ... that will talk to him is Lawrence ... it's Mitt they live [noise]\nYou can grab a thousand dollars four times a day\nWhere do I grant here it's so not\nThere for a day on

because we have changed our definition of what you can apply for asylum for and you can no longer apply for\n'em strictly poverty or or gang activity anywhere in your home country so getting a fair shake I mean if you don't necessarily apply for asylum or excuse me if you don't\nHave the requirements for asylum then you won't get asylum\nRight but but but the the irony is is that a lot of these migrants from what I understand that they don't even think that they're going to to to ... they don't even think they're entering into a fair process to discern to determine whether they do qualify like\nWhy are they coming out I mean when you talk about a fair practice was fair to illegally cross the border I mean you're already getting off the bat and what happened\nWhose some ordinary who's feeding them and how how why are they coming to talk of your process\nYeah no I I\nBut but you guys both race questions that lead to what I think my solution is is a good solution because the issue there's one word describes the problem is trust these folks\nDon't understand why we need to trust that Brian I mean we are at that\nAnd nice and that has ruled over who only allow in our border him in the right reason why\nThese are kids because\nThey understand Brian ... if I took my children over the border to Canada I Would expect to be detained because that's not legally allowed but I mean why would they think of anything different\nYou should be detained and and processed for an application for asylum in a fair manner and I get what you're saying they don't believe they're going to get treated unfair manner okay so what they're doing is not right I'm not sure telling you that they should just continue\nPlowing for what I'm saying is instead of sending in military troops\nWhich is what our presidents suggesting\nWe need to bring in a team of individuals who can try to speak to some sense into them and maybe you're right maybe Ninety nine percent of these people don't qualify for asylum but maybe if if they if they were were convinced that they're going to get a process that were fairly that whether they qualify\nLike why don't we get a ... of ... Mexican tell them to go back to their home country and go through the process like you were supposed to talk you out of it you have a conflict there and America coming up with it thousands of people in a caravan and\nAnd demanding that he let into the country illegally I mean that doesn't seem like right it's fair I mean why not trust them that's already in the last you know here\nOkay well that that's a good that's a great point but unfortunately we have to deal with reality so the reality now is not is it a perfect world is not what you you just suggested so now we have to deal with reality so what do we do some point I think we're going to have to get resources set up to start getting some of these\nThese and why why why not on the board or why not Mexico why are they doing it\nThey should have the right and that gets back to my point I made a few minutes ago what how is this how how does this just magically happened with\nRifles humans yes who's feeding them how are they how are they write\nWhat time I looked at him calls this is my ... and ... go ahead Louis yeah\nYeah I I I went to Cal story OK couple of months ago\nAnd you know why they well I wanted to go straight up and they may have a ticket that I was leaving I have to have a out the check it otherwise in the country\nSo I think these people shouldn't be coming up here\nIf they are a lot lately entitled to be coming here I Am in total agreement with what President Trump I think it's it's it's disgraceful people coming into this country are you know without a proper\nPaperwork got a block you said why isn't lexical how they get this far if I Try to get a kick out of up to\nAnd so a lot of the visit some friends and the chicken but more than twenty while fat and ... dollars you know\nAnd look at the guy who is there was a guy with a machine gun Ayman al hey when you when they crossed a guy with the machine guns across\nBut I'll tell you most twenty two\nThat's run a machine gun pointed directly after we don't do anything like that and why don't they do that\nI don't understand why I Do have the power to shut down the border as he threatened to live and he just do it if there's a caravan of seven thousand people who don't belong in your head this way that's what I Would do what he's going to do within its purview and threat\nRight well yeah I think I think eventually that's what's that's that's kinda what drew alluded to which was\nYou know doesn't that Mexico should uh do something they didn't now I think it becomes a problem with the United states so we're we're going to have to intervene at some point it looks like all I'm saying is I don't want this to turn into an ugly mass and say well you know we're sending down their military\nYou know reinforcement if we've got to send send down a law you know we have to send somebody 'cause it it it does it is our problem to\nWrite a really weird I noticed the way the press reported that when they were crossing the Mexican border as well they had us jeeps like who cares who made the news of the princes locked and loaded to make a negative story out of this if our military gets involved\nI I noticed that and it really struck my ear it's like you know that's the Mexican federal ... that are in in multiple lines of of with machine guns as they always tend to walk around with\nAnd uh and they just stood down I don't understand quite why but no but do appear might give 'em a comic read my\nDoctorate drill a always like listening to your show something that seems like it's largely left out of this discussion right now is the fact that these people are refugees fleeing violence in their own countries they're fearing for their lives that violates stands largely\nFrom instability created by us politicians in the eighties and nineties at our policies in Central America and this\nCountry's appetite for illegal drugs there is a process through which people can apply for asylum horns of course it an emergency situation yeah\nWe should not be shutting down an orderly\nWay way what does that procedure for for a ... getting asylum you apply for it you apply for her to come and go right into the mix but also right now and apply for it\nRight but you know I mean I I think there's got to be emergency procedures\nPut in what is emerging where he wants the emergency what what what suddenly happened that made it an emergency we don't know what the other\nDay I mean every now and the aging then at the\nEscalating drug violence in their own drug\nHunting or as in their own and buried in Honduras and Honduras through all of a sudden there was a problem Brian go ahead yeah\nLook through now my I think it was the point in my ... trying to make if I could kind of what makes your head as I saw I saw this morning a woman with two kids yeah whose husband had been murdered you're not murdered by gang and under or so so isn't the idea what makes\nIt doesn't that constitute an emergency situation\nDo we have we do change our laws where the that's not a\nNo longer um of a requisite for asylum unfortunately were hurt and agree with that but I don't want to integrate but a lot of people getting shot here because of gang\nYeah but I learned just let me say one last point I I get what you're saying with what the laws are but we have to do like the reality of the situation is you've got thousands of human beings somewhat kid should they be there know that they follow the rules no but are they there yes so what do we do that's what I'm trying to say maybe we need\nTo make sure I'm up on our allies ... what does Mexico doing correct what is Mexico during ... what are they doing well but yeah ... they're well they're retreating they're they're they're they're\nDoing what they know they're not ... in Mexico they're not interested in staying in Mexico\nThat's a great point that's a good point that's a good point some meaty that leads to the conclusion that we do need to send some type of reinforced a that's a great but we need to send reinforcement down there but I think it's for ... a\nTry to talk some sense of this book be than we do need to make an exception here and and try to process these people were there at I don't think you can just say if you just say sorry here's the law and ah you should have gone to the concert like Bruce\nThen it's going to the chaos if you've ever gonna end up getting killed so\nI I and I and just saying we're going to process them where they are ... and I'm moving caravan\nTo get them all to fill applications ever going to vet them light on their way up here and they're not interested in going through the normal Hannah they're not interested in\nSeeing now you you've got to deal with lung cancer and Brian ... now we're gonna have kids in cages again\nThat's the tension right\nYeah well you're well when you're going to have to do some ... what are you going to do what's the option drew let him keep walking to wear like they're not going to die on the water and food and it's a tough situation\nSomebody's feeding when somebody's given they've been why ever week somebody's been feeding them so they I don't understand who are well how and what's Mexico doing to help these people and what are they doing with the sanitation issues are what are they doing I I Love yeah I I I don't know if you look at the medical issues and I I don't get it there's something missing\nSome information or something that we all don't have\nRight now this is a humanitarian crisis the humanitarian crisis just by virtue of having ten thousand people in a mass without\nFinancial support without food and water without sanitation moving across anything that's that's a humanitarian crisis in what the hell's the matter with Mexico that they're not do a treating it accordingly\nThat's what we should we do and we should put putting pressure on our neighbor to the south to make sure it does not being on a boat\nAnd marijuana and you would ever
