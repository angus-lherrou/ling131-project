{"content": "State auditor [noise]\nThat was released yesterday [noise]\nFound the California spent\nFour billion with a B four billion dollars on medical coverage between twenty fourteen and twenty Seventeen for people who may not have been eligible for ... billion dollars ... it's amazing twenty Eighteen with the technology we have\nThat we don't have a database and algorithms which would kick out\nMedical medical problems for instance if someone is paying much much more than others in the same business\nIt would be a red flag right away but I guess they don't have everything I entered or entered competitively in different silos work can be compared um you've got Thirteen point one million Californians\nUm approximately one third of the state's population to the covers and to qualify you got to adults going to make less than sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty four dollars annually so the audit found four hundred and fifty three thousand beneficiaries who remark is eligible in the state system but not in the counties\nWhich indicates they may not actually be eligible for Medicare and they could be because they died or they move or they made more money and no longer qualify however\nStates Department of health care services paid four billion health plans and doctors for those patients over the four years and the audit founded fifty seven percent of the discrepancies lasted for more than two years so that means\nNot only did they catch it they didn't catch it and then it continued on and on and on one instance they gave a in LA county resident died in December twenty Thirteen\nAfter the death state continue to make monthly payments how does that not kicked it out to the medical health plan until August of this year dining twenty Thirteen\nThe state ultimately paid the plants three hundred and eighty three thousand dollars for a dead person\nThat they didn't know nothing kicks in that that person is devoid of moisture no longer talking no longer filming everything up um healthcare services established apparently a process for notifying counties have benefited your records that require follow\nA but their looks like they're trying gaps\nThat let the problem intensify and also persist um the amazing thing is they found fifty four thousand people who am I eligible in the county system but not in the state which could have delayed or made it difficult for them to access services\nFor which they did qualify so then you've got hardships in on that and so here's the end the audit may have paid four billion dollars to people who shouldn't have gotten it and listen what the audit recommend you ready\nHere it is the author recommends that department implement a better system wouldn't any system be a better system or by the end of the year and recover erroneous payments by June\nThe department said\nThat they agree with the recommendations but could not comply with them within that timeline so basically you're a figure is you have this audit release that says hey guys rethink\nYou overpaid four billion dollars in medical a fix it try and get a better system do it by the end of the year and get some of the money back by getting by driven and they're saying thanks for letting us know that's impossible we can't really do it so good night drive safely everybody for\nBillion dollars we they're not even sure if it's four billion it could be higher it could be lower but I guess in twenty Eighteen\nIf they're having a system in place for how long\nThey have gaps huge gaps in how to track the payments and if you throw a seven and twenty Thirteen they could still be paying you in twenty Eighteen even though you're no longer sitting up walking talking you're weekend burning so it's pretty amazing and you know what medical frogs been going on forever and I know the mob targets that\nI'm a husband white Dr teams I mean it's all over the place the fact that that we don't have a system that kicks it up immediately when something is suspicious\nAnd they don't have any kind of system for that or algorithm for that is pretty stunning to compare to other other claims turned in where we're just\nImmediately kicking a red flag gets you to four billion dollars of course when that's gone they come back and ask for more money and more money and more money or talk radio seven Ninety KBC indeed no\nI was reading

Halloween stories eight hundred to two to five to to to um you know this Muller thing Lauren and if you saw this where they are\nThey've asked the FBI to look into this um\nSomebody this talk radio host actually asking for information on Mahler or anybody to give any sexual misconduct or even ... even if they're willing to fabricate it against them he was asking for any and all that really it's really scary at that guy was\n... you read about that Jay wall guy right what what I'm Wondering is is this becoming a thing that's what I was just saying yesterday is knee to becoming used as a weapon now right\n... by all sides are and that seems very not cool to me not cool\nUh let's see if this man does that affect the bill Christians and that said that they don't bring up a a shift one was offered fifty thousand dollars to make accusations of sexual misconduct of workplace harassment against Robert Mueller to get the money this guy said she would need to sign an affidavit and promised a ten thousand dollar bonus if she did so quickly\nWe're going to start to serve the breaks she says her block is overrun by kids being shipped in their eight hundred to two to five to Jews photo resorts five doctors but they don't have a talk radio some Ninety KBC\nDrop program it is amazing to me that now that it's come to the like the new chief LAPD you've got a one point to\nSeven million dollar pay out and then was rehired 'cause of the drop program and the drop program was made to be abused you can what they're doing is they're trying to keep senior members so that you don't leave them they're going to incentivize them\nTo stay an extra five years so you retire you come back\nYou get your salary and you get your pension\nThey found out that you don't need that for firefighters because they're incentivized enough\nAnd with the police you're finding out that they can abuse it by claiming a disability right it's right at the very end of their career and then coming back taking the drop money so they get that and they're not even working so it used to be when I was growing up when you were growing up that\nMy mother always said you know what you're not going to make a lot of money working for the government but it's a secure job you'll never get fired you'll never make a fortune today you worked for the government should the government you make a fortune ... and you don't get fired and you get benefits of the world to do and we're sitting here paying for\nThe most amazing benefits ever I'm not saying police work is not dangerous\nAnd somebody who has a disability because their police work shouldn't collecting the disability but the system that gives you one point to seven million dollars for retiring without giving up your job is a great system an an a great system to abuse or why wouldn't you do a disability claim right at the very end sign up for the drop\nWe're going to get the benefit of retirement and disability we which apparently people are doing and we found out that a I'm a firefighter got one point four million last year I'm Talking to right at the top list of highest paid retirees and other cities have dropped this program ... and\nWho um initiated the program said you know in retrospect bad program I didn't realize all the abused now that I see in the program so what is our city do our cash strapped cities with pension liabilities are incredible what do we do we're starting it we're looking at ... what do you have to study what do you have to do\nAs far as St venting is concerned they're trying to legalize street running now the problem with street vending for me is your restaurant owner you're paying rent you pay a business license you pay occupancy permits you pay utilities you play employees you pay payroll sales tax you have to meet the city county state\nFederal labor health and income reports on liability insurance and then you got a guy who wandered up in front of your store and\nOpens a uh a stand a taco stand and doesn't have to do any of that he's got no cost it's a cash business oh there's no income and sales taxes ... don't have to report it at all I'm Wondering if you're a I'm a business while you should have\nTo put up with that and by the way those people I don't think we want to be permitted as this point because again you're not showing taxes you're not showing\nYou know showing anything you can you can stuffed the money in your pocket and see you later all\nOf a sudden if I apply for a a permit and there's no way a first of all if I'm a legal I don't want to draw attention but second even if I Am legal street running generates a lot of unreported income so why would I pay for a permit then forces me\nTo report my income or to pay taxes that's another one of those things that just doesn't make any sense to me and I love to hear from store owners are about this potential\nLicensing of street vendors I mean city hall is trying to move that sing forward how would you enforce we don't have enough\nPolice we don't have enough to enforce what we have now are you going to send people out to enforce street vendors they're saying to her side on a city block\nIt would allow the creation of special vending districts with customized rules allowing more for your vendors in the area again\nIf I'm a store and I've got an inventory up and I've got to pay minimum wage and I've got to do all the groups are going to jump through and then I got a vendor opening and selling tacos and I'm a taco restaurant I Would not be really happy about that\nI Know [noise]\nAn art Edwards birthday of she paid a hundred to two to five to to to use it for a number of a deal I've learned spawn doctor do going out to Syria we're talking about people courting kids into various neighborhoods that sort of we're trick or treat 'em off triple trick or treat optimal Sarah what do you say\nI got to do it\nAnd we had always had a very busy street or exactly what you're saying the kids and it was great when my kids are going up\nBut now street I'm One neighbor particular which is great but they have created a huge pirate ship on the end of that and they put like a place for these days and then the hash\nTag ... now it's like wow yeah now we have people\nAnd that that's exactly it and I have turned into a Halloween the last couple of years I turned out my lights\nOn the next day oh my God I driveways like it's like mainstream Disneyland it's we\nDon't they ask the other neighbors permission for this thing\nWell you see that everyone decorated some degree but now people are dropping out so that was one neighbor at the end of the other but we never I mean I don't want to be the one that said don't do it because it's been that way since plenty of that now it's\nAbout a mile oh and I I hate that I hate it but I don't\nWrite but it really ... you become the all laid out of the street that huge dude are they angry at the end they\nLeft me this is\nSo funny well you know it's interesting but what's fascinating is are there was a a a demographic shift right you had kids that you didn't\nYeah that's exactly it that might be part of it maybe I just I Do like Seattle looking for like neighborhood\nBut right but at the end for him but I'm Wondering I mean I Wonder does the neighborhood generally have less kids in it\nThey do yeah which are the Scott\n... where are they coming from you know the kids\nI think they're coming from the San Fernando valley or around around areas and Valerie yeah\nI mean we can take that and this really isn't a illustration of our immigration problem was that way you want to go I think candy and a long there and\nIt's a metaphor yeah some metaphor you go where the candy is good in this particular shape their case or they're going with the pirate ship as though\nThey're going where the party as right wing party and people who live there are like hey well you're not from the ... what's that\nWell that's me anyway [laughter]\nOh well maybe I'll go check out the ... for that say\nDon't tell anyone really keep it a secret for her guards there thanks for the call appreciate\nMy number's eight hundred to two to five to two two as I've been saying we have our friend Michael Wilson whistle blower attorney coming in here at the top of the next hour after the news ... you're going to talk to us we'll Whitey Bulger and a large going to talk about how much he loves the guy that killed them or I could you not right ...\nYeah have you ... I found her killer without murder and and then was he not condoning any of his was the early a life sentence if he is very strange and an anti nature and the\nTwo o'clock hour sure Michael single pin Republican political consultant to talk about the fourteenth amendment and with Mr Trump can or cannot claim as it pertains to add to what his opinion is our number is eight hundred to two to five to tube Florence von ... this is ... take a break for some news with Jeff widow\n[noise]\nOne is she was already a threat there was a hit on hill at these prisoners kept losing 'em too is that he kept making threats to the south and so they had to move around and you know he may be eighty nine and but it's still Whitey\nAnd got enemies and one of them\nThe re de ... Lauren however them yeah he's a very good looking did I mean apart from other criminal history and the fact that it's having a life sentence or a guy by the river the psychopathic part he hated Iraq he hated rationing ... criminal informants\nWomen noise when he ... he ate it rats and he hated women abusers the sound and I kind of guy yeah Whitey was both so you know he was a rat who abused women um you know the the other ... you know [laughter] nightmare on elm street\nSo with the other thing the other thing here though is that no one of vultures stature or reputation should be placed in general population right away\nI'm In the weak link here what ... yeah he was\nPut in generally aren't much advice than a year in solitary yeah but don't really know what it's random or a transfer guy when he\nSays he transferred to the west Virginia prison was put into all population which she was true which is something that was never done especially since there's already been a couple Chileans at that prison in prison was under staff I mean they're saying like teachers a nurse nurses were asked to come and help guard\nYou know I Know I'm outta here right now and I signed up Miller\nAre now imagine what would you if you're all of a sudden say you were doing some good will volunteering at that\n... you don't got pregnant she had this guy is coming down the hallway swinging gym sock full of padlock thanked me like I'm going to put my resignation [laughter]\n[laughter]\nNo question but you know he's had a notorious life everything from you know a guy knows how many people you know complicity in Nineteen birders shooting people between the eyes you know beating women um he also allegedly won fourteen million dollars in the Massachusetts state lottery\nHer or him take him and his\nHis his partner but they said they court course electric course of the true winner to get some of that money but he was the head of the winter hill gang so yeah he's got a big you know he didn't have any friends at the end I think it was one of the problems when you go to prison like that\nYou either have allies yup that which you shut up or you have money and I think at that point in in his career he hadn't either and so he was just basically a dead men walking as as a defense attorney said he was given a life sentence which turned into a death sentence\nUm yeah it did ... how how much the law enforcement worry about that this kind of thing when I was wondering about so many you know a mob guys in prison serving terms and they try and keep them apart and they ... or ... you know\nI think everyone is aware of them and just go to pile on that question and just say we're I think a lot of people where the drugs are smuggled into prison pretty effectively but I didn't know that murders could so easily be carried out like that in one day somebody's just taking down\nWell I think the big picture here um you know Whitey kind of burned so many bridges that will soon no one was going to stand up or I'm probably not even the cars um especially and I understand I presume the guards probably are not ready in that prison\nI'm more I Would say the actual prisoners and you know maybe you know the beds\nMob team that you know was was in that prison you know the bigger thing here is here's a guy who not only was a snitch but he also had the FBI honor as though you know um he was able to get away with murder as even while he was an informant with FBI huh\nSo um I I think at this point I I personally thought everyone was like oh you know just let it go you know put them in general population let's say the taxpayer some money here\nYou would think would have made some noise about that but I guess how would anybody heard\nYeah he was eighty nine years old I mean he was in a wheelchair fledgling when he was killed really push him to the\nSide with there's no camera and aside area of the jail not he was in itself they push them in the general population aside area where there's no camera and that's where they beat them and actually allegedly they came back with a mock to clean it up\nOh my God well because I watch orange is the new black I understand all the workings of a person of course yeah I'm an expert on that uh it it's all very seriously\nI watched the odds felt like oh yeah you got your expert or yes yes\nWell I mean even recently in Baltimore the black guerilla as the leader of the black ... was the by prison gang bomb allege\nHe ran his whole drug trade from a prison and even got one or two guards pregnant\nOh ... ... ... ... ... now and we're going to an hour and someone else with ... around a lot of\nYou know how prison to understand sometimes the gangs run the prison you know I mean it was here in LA like LA has about Nineteen thousand prisoners LA county which is spread out throughout the state but LA county jail has about nineteenth out I mean that's a lot less like a university\nRight huh well I I I I mean I I feel bad for people that have to try to contain these populations I mean I Know it's a massive task but\nAt what happened to someone who is not affiliated with again and again the president you have to pick aside otherwise you you won't have any you know and if any allied yeah\nWell that's where money comes in I mean look OJ Simpson was in prison right about he wasn't in a gang but you know he had money and so you pay for protection\nWhich means that you know you're paying one cent into your prison account but gang members have family members on the outside you know anyone can in no one's untouchable and so that's how you kind of take care of things\nWhile I'm what kind of money that is a matter of we know kind of money on people pay I'm absolutely no idea yeah um but I Would assume that it was pretty substantial I mean you can put money into people's prisoners prisons accounts they go buy stuff too right you know whether they like honey buns and extra extra food and snacks\nAs we learn from Aaron Hernandez who love the honey buns and then you are eating about the food and Michael I my question would also be ... and you're a whistle blower um\nYou know attorney ... um is it on any viable for someone in prison to you know blow the whistle on certain gang activity that he knows is about to happen let's say if you knew they were planning on killing Whitey Bolger when he was transferred and you told authorities would it make a difference and would you pay for that [laughter] and\nAnd some are yeah you'd probably be a debt you'd be a dead man walk and there's no point in in a ... you know there is a coating of lawyers of\nCode yet and I know I don't know who would do that you know I mean there is no advantage to some people may do that to get extra time for me you know maybe they get time slash FEMA but you know here\nYou hear this guy who allegedly killed Whitey Bulger crazy I mean she was already serving a life sentence so he had nothing to lose and everything in the game now he is going to be the number one God you know he's going to be a celebrity\nIn a ... he's going to run things now while it's a very what happens oh that's great he is he didn't let me just\nSay one of the things I Will say to the differences\nLike for whistle blowers in general like an attorney we don't give up our sources so you know we may represent people but we never give up information sources\nNow here Whitey ... gave up everybody but um so I mean he sold everyone under the bus for his own neat ... even ... you know his close family members so\nYou know there's some issues except for his brother and by the way one thing I Would say this is something about you look at you many here's someone that Whitey Bulger who had a history of violence and killing his brother on the other hand was a senator in Massachusetts was president of the University of Massachusetts\nReally huh that's a ...\nDifferent seeds from the same apple isn't that isn't that\nCrazy it's very crazy it's crazy to he didn't get dragged into any of this right you did uh\nHe he he he spoke to Whitey while he was on the land back in like two hours of forced out there and the minute that he spoke to his brother and said you know I Love my brother I don't agree what he does but you know she's still my brother because of that um he was forced to resign from the University of Massachusetts as president President\nAnd have have we really made a sort of significant progress with organized crime in this country or is it just popping up at different forms\n[noise] um you know I think it's popping up in different forms I mean so first you had a traditional organized crime right of a mobsters um and now you have more developed um you know the coach of different before there were no drugs that were allowed now their drugs are latch and now what you're seeing with math and opioid\nYou know there's different different organized crime especially with the opioid epidemic and obviously we don't have the the law or spent a lot of the resources to really stop everything [noise] um so are we a tight now the opioid epidemic the mess epidemic is gross\nYeah the best way to getting betting ... out of hand and people don't really realize it and it is a that is a\nVery corrosive drugs if in in a weird way probably socially or worse than opiates because it because people get aggressive and violent\nRight exactly exactly if I wrote one story where a kid was a stranger of the week it as opposed each someone had put mats and as trick or treat\nCat we heard about it was taken to the

and the ear to building so\nThe pre operationally obsession thinking and all that stuff but ah I I it does is that person like unable to like keep his room and order or is there a lot of chaos around

doing getting hit it\nDates back you know what I'm yeah I Would I Would go out and the problem with simple talking is that any action you take will escalate the soccer right so if you when you come down and you have to have enough evidence to come down very very hard oh yeah there's\nA theory that whole area that is that went on for almost two years during the relationship and then after I cut out it was like worse because the sister would show up different places than it was really horrible 'cause I was in the same industry she was and unfortunately she yeah that was really the ... the\nPart that he was keeping tabs on you to her yeah and he knows that with everybody and he knew like all his ex girlfriends he knew their whole\nIf that's the kind of a social person like she has

order\nYou know that that doesn't escalate the stocking the restraining order sometimes increases the problems if you if you can ignore a simple soccer that's usually the best mark understanding of

him that he can pull this off is that true or is this just posturing before an election\nWell I mean I I Would believe he probably has spoken with\nUm some attorneys who were probably in a very small minority on this I mean every legal scholar ranging from some of the top legal institutions in our country to even the smaller ones who have all ... dinner given some type of an opinion either publically or written on this topic\nAll agree that the president does not have the constitutional authority to do this now let's keep in mind the fourteenth amendment came into existence because it it was\nSort of making permanent something that we call Tom and law rule of birth it was something that exist that two hundred fifty plus years ago and essentially what it did was\nAfrican Americans and the descendants of African slaves ... permanent citizens of the United states so\nI as an African American would not only be concerned or if the president a word to say you know we're we're going to change that then what does that mean in some southern states are smaller towns that have a history of racial discrimination and how they treat\nAfrican Americans and other people that are so I think this is something that could open Pandora's box in more ways than one and again I think the president opened his mouth on something that I don't think he was clear on and I think there are a lot of people across the country who are legitimately concern\nBecause once again we have the president who is essentially disregarding precedent disregarding norms\nAnd other conservative that is something that is antithetical to where we are expected to believe\nWhich was the case there many cases you know a court challenge Supreme courts evaluated that were prerogative of fourteenth amendment which was one you quoted\nSo the ... the court case that I caught it was a case from Eighteen sixty eight it was along the king Kim art over the u._s. where it's wrong to Kim art you have to read the case it's a very very interesting case and essentially a what they did was say it would exclude the citizenship\nOf children born in the U.S so if someone were to come into the U.S and have a kid then that case the things they said well yes that kid as a citizen but that does not make the parent citizen right\nSo back to my point the president is bringing up something that's already been settled Dr Drew says those immigrants come to the country which they do often and believe it or not it's not even Hispanics that are doing this a lot of actually\nAsian hand around and from Asian countries Russia that are already ahead of Hispanic and doing that corner laid back\nThat court case or make it to say that I'm fighting a six state of that yes those\nBabies we will grant those babies US citizenship we will recognize them as us citizens however we will not recognize the parents as us citizens and of course there is a process\nAs you're on a legal process that the parents has to have to go through in order to ultimately get some type of US citizenship status so again back to my point Dr through that is true this\nIs something that's already been settled as I can say the president it was bringing this up in an interview as if he just thought of something that's amazing and he hasn't\nHasn't that is shocking kind of shocked insurance on that\nNow but I don't I'm looking at the fourteenth amendment and it wasn't ratified until Eighteen sixty eight so how did they challenged the same year there was ratified was this something unrelated to fourteenth amendment\nWas related as it relates to Scottish Irish\nIn German and European uh parents and I can't remember all the details oxygen to have to read over\nIt yeah yeah I mean I'm just trying to our myself with this sort of give ... because that's what I'm thinking is that this recording is a review all this stuff and figure out I mean it's really not going to be any kind of decreed that's going to change this and I suppose the well\nWell I I just find it I mean again even with Brett Kavanaugh I've been on on the big big court started to do I would find it very very difficult to believe that record which I Would argue is more\nRights leaning conservatives again typically have an originalist view how the constitution should be interpreted I always find that very very difficult to believe that the Supreme Court what would up hold some type of the executive order\nFrom the president of the United states is simply changing an amendment I think the court said Mr President we understand the critique or the concern from the executive however the constitution dictate an amendment change being with the legislative branch of government the United States House\nAnd Senate and so this is something that you want to change that you need to work with the legislative branch to make that happen but we can not grant authority for the executive to do that because if you do then you essentially open again Pandora's\nBox to be at a the exec in order to do whatever they write write constitution with the president says all of a sudden you know we don't want women to vote anymore right change that we don't want to find yeah\nWell he's got to remember that the about the female he may like using this now but the next president he may not like whatever the next president party Ryan has a home or whomever just ran out like if you have to be careful constraining the executive office I totally agree with that\nBut but I but I'm Still struggling with you know we can tell people not to yell fire in a crowded theater in that and not have an amendment on the first amendment\nAnd our change with the first amendment it seems like we should be able to have some sort of guideline on the fourteenth amendment\nThat would make it rational so you know in this part of the Southern California we have we have birth tourism you know people are set up home houses all hospitals that to bring people in for a week and have babies and that's it and send it back out\nWhere I I Would like to do I would certainly agree that you obviously in the cases of emergencies where there is a swarm of\nPeople coming into the country by those roles and they're doing this and obviously one that argue that that could be a state of national security for a lot of different reasons as it pertains to our value most valuable resources and taxpayers having to pay for these new babies I Do think that that is most certainly a legitimate critique\nTo make and that's one that I Would be even willing to entertain but I Do not think one has to drastically change or the legitimacy of the fourteenth amendment as it currently stand now look the executive with the president wants to say I think\nYou know allowing these individuals to come into our country is an undue\nBurden on our society as an undue burden or risk to our national security than I Do think\nThere would be a legal case for the president or to make an and I\nMean leaving temporary writer a tape these corporate type thing\nAnd I think that precisely and I think that argument that route from my view would probably grant the president\nMore of a legal standing in a statement he gave in the act seals interview that I just want to change the fourteenth amendment which was extremely vague has a lot of people concerned\nRight and I I he was in there and they're leaving the White House today and sort of clarified again\nThat he saw it as a temporary move that he felt that he could temporarily modify the operation of the fourteenth amendment so I think what you're talking about his where his head is out now even though the Lawrence point to Lawrence point may all still just be political posturing\nTo get people to vote who are who knows\nWell I mean let's keep in mind when the president came down at escalator at Trump Tower he talked about immigration that was a big selling point when he launched his presidential campaign and throughout the duration and if you look at various focus groups\nOr cross tabulation data and other polling data immigration is an issue that resonate very well not only will Republican men and women are Dr ... but it also resonates very well with independent\nMet her in a slight ... in a small percentage of independent women\nI Do and what do you think about it in terms of politics the ability to mobilize people and to get people concerned the president has tapped\nInto something here and I think that's why you're beginning to see a lot of races that\nThirty days sixty days ago weren't as close as they are now beginning to become very close with a lot of people will say you know I don't like a lot of the rhetoric coming from the president but when I think not only about a lot of people coming into the country they don't necessarily think about crowd of all the time that they do think what burden will this have on my\nImmunity yeah but I live in a small community on the resources that we have\nWho's going to pay for those things that impacts people people's day to day that's almost like a bread and butter issues those things people can rationalize and I think the president recognizes that which is why as sort of talk to it I think it's going to be a continued message that you're going to hear up until next Tuesday\nI saw her friend and culture last night at ... book signing an ad was very excited about this birthright things you thought it was great\nAnd a Scaramucci himself spoke about how the ... working middle class has their their purchasing power they're real wages are way down compared to where they were even in the seventies\nAnd that we have ignored that population that's one sure Michael you were talking about that that
