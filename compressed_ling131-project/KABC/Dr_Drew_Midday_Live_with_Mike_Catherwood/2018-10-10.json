with sustained winds not guests but sustained winds of one hundred and fifty five miles per hour correspondent Eritrea hill is in Destin, Florida and says one man to tempted to ride out the storm in a boat\nA study for a little while 'cause they they're the ones who is your birth certificates who who um authorized issue it's a birth certificate or there is there is the ability for air at a a newborn to choose acts of birth certificate\nUm but that's often a geared towards parents whose children quite frankly you know are are are ... or\n... or ... intersects right right so so well good\nAll right uh but\nWhy don't we all gender acts by that sort of criteria we should all be gender X ray at the beginning\nAnd the other two are saying uh I suppose maybe there are some people who argue that I don't know [laughter] I suppose it could be area\nWow so this would be um effective immediately or\nGoes into effect on November first and I'm a\nMember wheeler birth certificate to get it modified\nOr you have to apply or through a eat the city's department of health\nTo get a change because they're they want to keep the keep the records when it comes to birth certificates ah the um uh communities that that that uh advocated for this a part of this and Mayor Bloomberg I work I'm Sorry a ...\nA bluebird on the line because you know registering as a Democrat today a narrative lousy lousy oh um\nHe uh he came out with this and I think a lot that or should the government be telling you who you are right about that I'm In a building right now and there's still a lot of we got I'm Sorry about that\nThere's some you know they're saying that you know should the government tell you who you are you become the government who you are or how you identify should've government telling you how you can identify yourself or you should you be telling the government how you identify yourself ...\nAgain I I I get that for driver's license things like that but a birth certificate seems like a mixed bag because it is either physicians are parents that it seems to me or identifying the gender and it it sounds like the left it wide open to a whole set of different criteria in every parent patient\nEvery parent physician combination is going to use their own set of criteria to figure out how to fill out this form yeah\nYou know it was um it was interesting to hear transgender people speak about this talking\nAbout how uh how it affects them how are those who weren't able to have um a birth certificate that corresponded with how they self identified out how they live their lives I have to basically they described as having it out themselves every time they get into a situation for instance uh apply for college you know\nUh for classes in college I professors would see them listed a you know by by us their birth name\nInstead of uh what what they identify as today if you're a transgender person that she said it was um yeah it ... it was really for her scary you know to go\nInto the situation one glass woman I I don't know but I just had kids that went through college the name they call them was the name they put on their application\nWhere first of all with I don't know why having an excellent\nMake things easier but it's also not an ... figure either way that the ability to to change their names as well I think all well so you know what all this\nDoes amazing amounts to the infectious disease outbreak in this country the toughest outbreak that isn't that is the danger in San Francisco and Los Angeles does a lot for that\nSo I I'm just upset today because we have a major infectious disease outbreak in Southern California that is roaring along and we just don't have our eye on the ball\nBut I I'm all for this for a for driver's licenses I'm I'm worried about how it's going to get applied in birth certificates that seems like it needs a set of criteria ran the criteria don't seem to be part of the deal I also find it strange that it's a city wide thing and not a state wide thing\nHere in New York state I think they're they are um there are some people who propose legislation like this state wide but the city has the ability to do this themselves since they issue a birth certificate ... necessarily issue an agency here in New York City that rely on on the state tuition those birth certificates here so they were they were able to do that within their own ...\nThat's interesting yeah and well again I I think we are if they're going to do this a humble in my opinion is they should go all the way we should all be gender exit the beginning [laughter] I Know I'm Serious because otherwise it's going to be very arbitrary and a lot of confusion later\nAnd a and you know of course if people want to change their birth certificate because of how they live their life great I have no problem with that at all but at the the initial filling out of the paperwork is going to create a lot of weird stuff down the line I suspect\nUh All right Steve thanks so much that report and uh we will talk to you soon\nPleasure take care\nRight by by Steve ... western correspondents or give us your current calls on this eight hundred to two to five to to to to have any feeling either way because if we all sort of gender acts and then how we live our life is what our gender evolves into than that that gets declared as an adult later on other documents\nSeem sensible to me I don't remember my birth certificate ever coming into plainly I find the pilot\nThe well ... those kinds of documents can't come into play but not in terms of your name or your sex already feel anything that's on the paperwork or what are you what are you there [noise]\nAnd uh so look that that's just how it is um but I find people wanted this way no problem but he wore a diversity of it could should be a strictly biological documents for people\nBecause people like me to understand what the ... Turner's syndrome I Need to know and if somebody is X Y y I Need to know that their clients filters I Need to know it it we can't we can't be bothered with ... have you lived there any biological things that have to be attended to when you're a physician right and that's what your tend to do then\nYes on yes it's important in many other domains but the biology has to still be attended to eight hundred to two to five\nTo to to you you you can't pretend the biology doesn't exist I listen to me it it exists that's where we have things called gynecologist and that's where we have your college him from these things art and these are necessary differences in the biology not the gender random\nBiology eight hundred to two to five to ... to is the phone number if you have any comments on this we live here eight hundred to two to five to to do at the bottom\nYou know I really hope that they you know when when you were talking about how they spoke to the last transgender people and how it affected their life to have the wrong name getting called out hope that I don't think this is well before they have this long to that they could find out if there's any repercussions over there they are struggling fusing\nI'd seen there will be that's what I'm saying there will be a an I ... and the than in some of it's going to be started at the beginning there when who knows what may be fighting with your patients into the parents I mean I I don't know what that's going to be\nA eight hundred to two to five to to do as a number at the bottom the ever going to talk to disaster claims

it's a it's a major down day eight hundred to two to five to two to Tara Tara Tara\n... what are you saying\nYeah I just was curious how that's all going to work because from my understanding\nA lot of times if there is like a natural disaster or something like that ... people wind up in situations where they need to identify bodies it's kinda morbid way to look at it but how does it work is stairs mismatched information and it was just curious how\nIs it is just going to be one of those things if we don't specify biology somewhere\nIn other words like actually some backup thing or something I have yeah that's what I'm saying that there's also so that\nThey were going to need we're going to need to change the nomenclature sort of their biology and the gender yeah ... yeah different words but the biology has got my I'm telling you how did you got to be\nClear somewhere because he makes a difference in terms of the medicine trust me think of ... we're pretty sure that

set up for that\nActually were very fortunate now and that we are but we're even more fortunate that it it\nIn an area um me I'm sad for everybody who got hit there you wouldn't want to be the people that are there but there are a lot fewer people don't ... your your large buildings and say earthquake hit Los angels or San Francisco or a major candidates category for hurricane goes through

significant storm surge and the fact of the wind just really will be devastated those people who happen to be there and just looking at the map is across on being on on at landfall is that Mexico

as it pertains to their anti trust\nA liabilities and he's also just crushed discuss with us the major ... well I'm sure it's a question of the major drop in the stock market today and what has a sort of interpretation of that is where this is beginning of a real correction or not we'll get into that\nOur number is eight hundred to two to five to to do I make sure what you all think about the idea of\nThese gigantic companies being broken up somehow um Amazon is interesting in that its size benefits the consumer and usually the goal of anti trust is protect the consumer against monopoly action\nBut the way that it creates a throws other businesses and fail\nI mean I've never really I don't know enough that I ended up any trust to know whether that's part of the thinking everywhere whether the other businesses are thought of as American consumers in a sense and that they're being destroyed by the just size of Amazon whether it's just unfair and really that's the other thing by the end I trust with\nBoth love affair to eventually it does affect the consumer right because if if and when I started to move prices if the ... out of isn't it yeah and the only ones selling and that and raise the price that they do anything they want that blood type things so maybe they didn't they weren't good ah but then again there\nAre many like ... diapers dot com that came around on the scene when you know the Internet was hot and it was like I can order diapers or not you know and I have to go to the store to pick up big bulky diapers gets an Amazon dot com did they under sold via diapers on their site randomized isn't then bought the ones that we met in the terminal\nArticle Amazon thing but I I Wonder if it's so that's one aspect of anti trust liability the other is things like Facebook and Google who have undue\nInfluence on the American psyche in ways that are see I I Would argue that Facebook in particular is manipulating unless ways that we are not aware absolutely and that seems like an antitrust issue the merits at least seems like a safety issue and it's largely able to\nCarry out its desires upon us because of its size and that's an anti trust issue I think\nI don't know who makes up these algorithms that I see on my Instagram feed I Can't tell you how many products I bought on may know me so well\nAnd you know in theory they even known now

slowing down is absolutely rates are going up which makes the pain of higher\nOr another part of a problem with the real estate market though is you have all these people who did refinance\nA year ago two years ago three years ago and now they have like three percent mortgage and they certainly don't want to sell their house to either a to get a new mortgage are higher price house because all of a sudden\nThey go from a three percent mortgage or five percent mortgage that prices that amount of stepping up on the house of the supply of reef sales is going down dramatically as well that was another issue facing the market\nThat's interesting yeah yeah yeah I never thought about that now [laughter] questions you have a um no I mean\nWe were talking about that ... you know perhaps it short term this the pain that we're feeling from the parents but I Know folks that are are the\nMass layoffs companies like four and um you know after losing a billion dollars to these trade parents are they going to have lasting effects on our economy even if they are short term so\nThey are short term but typically hopefully down the road they will obviously come to some sort of agreement as far as getting rid of the ... the terrorists you know there's there is short term pain but as corporations all ways to\nYou know they manage through cost increases whether they become more efficient through technology or like you said they lay off people from that standpoint so obviously you and I would prefer there not be a terror for\nBut that's the place that we're in right now and so hopefully uh companies will start to get supplies from other nations that are you're already starting to see corporations out changing suppliers that's a longer term ability to to block the tariffs\nBut do you think that's that's the best we can hope for the kind of blend the parents or are we going to see 'em you know a positive income I mean a positive outcome from these parents in general from the trade wars\nYou've already seen NAFTA the old agreement between Mexico United States and Canada has spent renegotiate it up for what I Believe is is a better settlement so one of the things that they're trying to get\nWhen they are working the trade war with China is intellectual property rights you know the theft of intellectual property rights that corporations have\nYou know that's a big strain on the U.S GDP and so we've had presidents in the past talk about that and so whether this works or law that's one of the primary drivers of this trade war\nSo let's switch gears for just a second and talk about the larger companies uh the the huge companies that now sort of\nAll of us interact with on a daily basis somebody a famous a marketing professor from my guess NYU or UCLA was suggesting that Amazon had to be broken up that Amazon was you know guilty and have been scary and\nAre ruining retail businesses and looking at the owners of businesses much the way previous than I trust 'em ledges of attorneys perhaps looked at the customers\nAmazon is good for retail customers but not good for retail owners and retail businesses generally number one or companies like Facebook or Google who may have undue influence upon us enter manipulating us in ways that are really some people would call dishonest or are they have these companies gotten too big\nSo I think you know from the anti competitiveness\nNature that's really what the government works like\nFor consumers is the consumer being hurt and when you look at Amazon prices have come down number one\nWhich is that after the consumer number to\nDo is you look at Walmart you look at target which are improving their operations to combat or the competition from Amazon so sometimes competition creates a better market place for the overall consumer it's when as you just said\nWhen the consumer is actually placed at a disadvantage\nWe look back at the anti trust rulings when Microsoft what's being looked at you know they were looking at it and say hey there's only one dominant player\nYou know that I can get my software from and the prices charge are going up for the cable industry when you add consolidation and\nPrices were up so typically\nOff the government is is more apt to go out to break a company out or really look at a at a company when they see consumer being harm\nRight is consumer prices going\nDown I get that but what I'm Wondering is if there is a new category because of the new technological space we've all entered\nA new category of consumer harm I I Would call it sort of undue influence\nOr that they have an undue influence on our thinking and are buying in our politics for the victims will not ... they're using they're using our biology against us knowingly self self may ... premeditated like yeah\nAnd they're able to do it because of their size will we ever see a day well that becomes a malpractice excuse me a antitrust argument\nI think they're already looking into that and I think the market has already reflected that in the stock price if you look at Amazon with now even two months ago twenty two percent one day it\nIt was over two hundred dollars a share two twenty a share down close to a hundred and fifty dollars a share so the market is coming in there and saying hey there looks like regulations are coming you've seen from Google Facebook you know they are already acknowledging\nThat regulations need to be provided a\nIn this area part of their thinking though from Facebook and Google standpoint as they want regulation now it would actually help them because they're big enough\nTo handle the cost of regulation so yes I Do think whether it's break up a regulation that is certainly coming especially with you know obviously all that has come out with Facebook as far as uh the last presidential election\nYou say it is coming oh no question about oh\nIt's a real interest on heard say that clearly are people go well you know it's good for the consumer Amazon women doing so much good and and they're ah you know I think at least split it into a satellite company in a retail company right\nWell I'm not saying that the companies can get split up I'm I'm not saying that at all what I'm saying is is that these companies are going to be faced with\nMore regulation and they had had\nHearings you know Facebook will testified in front of the subcommittee\nAbout potential regulations going forward on the issue that you talked about of undue influence right into the consumers and those types of things to the break up I Can't comment on\nI see so so regulation I I'm not convinced that of that but that that's not really an anti trust things so much as a just a legal matter right\n... and I write of our current\nYeah state of our coverage delayed yeah of a business conduct well interesting so David uh [laughter] I Know that as as a professional a wealth strategist the last thing you do is make predictions but to mid we drop in the market which to me seems weird what do you think's gonna happen tomorrow\n[noise] well we you know is there more buyers and sellers some are\nAre more virus than a sour some buyers you know the market probably if you look at how it closed at the end of the day you could easily see it down for Santa morning how it closes tomorrow could be a anybody's guess it's a flip the coin it's fifty fifty\nFour something about the mid week things is interesting to me because usually Mondays are Fridays are used to seeing these things right\nRight no no question about it but obviously the market or it was funny this morning if you got up and looked at what's called the futures which is an indication of where the market was going to be you know you have a dial up and the NASDAQ while and so in the beginning you the market was up\nThis morning and it just slowly\nOr came down and then obviously as you get closer to the clothes everybody's fearful you know the market goes up as an escalator but goes down an elevator ... so as we get closer to a close somebody close to you were at the top of the Empire State building and they were on the quick elevator down to zero\nSo you always see that people are fearful they don't want to hold a position overnight right I don't know what's going to happen in the Asian markets in the European markets\nRight the corrections happen fast enough to know more so than when there's excessive exuberance so\nLou here is good are you in the ... about black teen technology and everyone seems to me I Can't I Can't even have a car without them bringing up how
