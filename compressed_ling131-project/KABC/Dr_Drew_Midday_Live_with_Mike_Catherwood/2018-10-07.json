{"content": "She's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce and what you decided to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough and had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you could pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody want to help in the future\nKnow I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom and that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually came up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nPuerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times where he where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I I Would be down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big Eighteen the air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop and even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for like eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over and so it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know he had dial up Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really\nGoing in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand\nIdentify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you it it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather communist when I was like five years old\nI remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away and that's really how you approach the markets\nYou say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is it the half the class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay All right [noise]\nRight now I've got to have to add class coming up in your area that have take classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have take classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over included with your passes it's gonna be the professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some\nOr top instructors lessons

nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there\nWere some of the other kind of examples you could share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nLet's consistency Ryan most people come in and they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit ... be at a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next\nYou really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you if you're not happy right now than you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody\nWho's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change because people don't change in fact on Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and as you said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nYou know I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learned it really is and I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nAnd he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that so that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got\nNow one of the ways that where we start this off one of the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class in just three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time pass and let's get some people educated changed their lives our right well right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have to classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over include with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit\nNow this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced in your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes

Baron bomb is back to dish and I'm Glad to have you rose how you been\nOh great I think you're really busy working on the loving\nYeah definitely sound congratulations to you because I loved reading and it was so very real rose and fell very you in the introduction that it first you resisted writing a basics book essentially\nIt wasn't so much basics the idea of joining a book for entered because I've found\nThat heard from young people fourteen\nOne little ribbons countries there but on other ones like books were complex but then when I realized that I could have my dream\nOf having every\nRecipe of syphilis people can see the different stages I realized wouldn't ... everyone thinks this is\nI I think there's something brilliant about a tutorial reading through your book I felt like you were there with me and the kitchen\nAnd side by side right and you were\nExactly as close as you can get you know when you do videos then you have to be stopping them with their hands covered with butter and flour but ration book perch right by your side you can see it as\nDoing it and that's what makes it priceless in fact I Would love to read to all my other tend to be just like that but that would take another lifetime\nI was gonna say that's a big task gross [laughter] I'm\nAlso loved the measles plus what you plan ahead I wrote the rest was sick so when I go to my best female I much prefer to eat from the format because otherwise I always think or what do I start with for a true the recipes\nAre listed in the order of how they're used for something the salt and looks the butter or pre measured like the eggs and milk right so that makes it a dream so we're from\nAnd I think that for those beginners novices and even ... like\nThere is often a mindset that baking is a task and not because it's as complicated as you might think that because it takes time and patience and measuring right and so if it's stepped out then you really appreciate the delight and the thrill in the process well\nThis is true and you know the funniest part is that there are some that have appeared in other my books and people have said that the perception that they were typical but now without realizing it reviewers are saying\nLook this American ones that will be for the war and it's just all in the way which presents is\nI've always appreciated your recipes rose because I find them a very real very approachable that they're always crowd pleaser is and\nI really enjoyed the beginning of the book that you sort of encapsulated all of your philosophy in the top ten golden rules of baking and I wonder if you would mention a couple because I Believe in the basics and I think that we\nHave to often be reminded of where to start in order to get to the finish you talk about measuring ingredients by volume um I Know you believe in the importance of a scale give us a couple of uh two bits of\nI'm Keane advice if you would\nJust without even looking at the book and the only one of the stages\nOf construction of the top rules which means that it really he's\nSort of looking at stuff because then you see the whole approach\nProbably my most important rule fled from helmets that are easier it is way than to sodium\nIs to not substitute ingredients which often people sensitive to at least the first time they make it they should\nMake it according to the patients to ensure that for the worst because if you change one thing for you'll see the difference the second time around if you change things you don't know which made a difference and these are very carefully constructed recipes so I Would say that oh the most critical rules\nAlso having accurate instantly thermometer huge difference at all so\nIt's nice to have an accurate of around with her but if you use common sense is safer risk she says twenty to thirty minutes as taking forty\nThat means you have to turn it up or vice versa down if it's taking less time because the time in which case they really have structure and then it'll touch the flavor\nSee I Know that feeling getting caught up in your hand is I'm a ... is not only disconcerting but its halting at times I Love the you believe in three big milestones\nSo let's do the work you\nSay first game then create then rise\nYeah you know these milestones our our for anyone it doesn't matter what age you are doesn't matter who you are and where you come from and and what they're about the ditches about how can we let go of the mindset that are keeping us here and keeping us in this feeling of loss\nIt's everything from the molds that society is telling us to fit in to the obsession with the big picture in the big\nGoal that we think is going to be our answers and how can we really love that stuff go and what do we replace it with\nAnd then create is about when we actually get into action and and my emphasis is on really small plans you know if I ask you to jump thirty feet that would be way harder than if I asked you to jump one foot and so it how do we take those\nThey're tiny stuff over and over and over and who do we need around us to continue to do that and then the rise of the ascension is what happens when we're actually moving and\nYou know while we might think that that frame bows and sunshine actually it can be quite hard it can come with some uncomfortable feeling and feeling fear but\nYou know expansion just like on a woman's body of a stretch marks or on anyone's body with growing pains expansion can leave it's marks and how do we deal with that um and how do we reframe fear is\nAs friction which means that we're moving it means that we're going somewhere\nIt reminds me what you're saying of a story and you know I take everything to the food analogy on but the story of colonel Sanders and a Kentucky Fried chicken he failed in ... he was in his mid sixties and became a billionaire an eighty eight years old so you\nCan mean you can't pry right exactly I Love that you talk about to building\nA ... a a consortium of a gang a group of people around you that motivate you that believe in you write how how does one find that roster\nThere is it's so important that we have this community no matter who they are because you know I think so often we\nPut all the pressure on ourselves to figure it out to do it effects that uh you know joys an inside job type stuff and while that's all fine and dandy external validation from the right people can actually be a life force for us and and our beliefs matching bears and\nI think you know when we're trying to build that looking for the people that are in our corner\nLooking for the people that are more excited about our success than we are you know there are some\nReal court tons to people that we need around us while we're\nGoing on this path of unknown which can be really hard and\nYou know the the roster that I outline is a group of about Fifteen people and and different what they can provide to our life but what they can provide to our path now that doesn't have to be Fifteen different humans that you have it's a pretty big group you could have five people that fit all of those\nThat's in our you know multi position players but it's really just a matter of having a weariness over what might be missing and and who it is that you should be leaning on in in times that are more difficult than others\nYeah I think that that that group support and that effort does make a difference you tell wonderful real life stories in your not lost I loved reading about uh the refinery twenty nine founder Pierre oh\nYeah yeah about rising above ... yeah\nIt was incredible I actually saw her at a conference and the main at this massive thousand person conference you know to be interviewed at the end\nThe expert and she is up on stage talking about how she doesn't know what he's doing half the time and she feels so off all the time I'm like oh my gosh we have to do a book and\nIt was so refreshing right to know that you can be creating amazing things and not have it all figured out and I often joke sometimes I feel lost every first day of the month it doesn't mean that don't still create it doesn't mean that you\nStop it just means that you know sometimes we have some not so great feeling but we're not our feelings and and we have ourselves which actually is enough\nAnd she is really the lesson that you have woven through the book and that is you you must believe in yourself because at the end of the day that's what propels you right\nYeah it's really I mean the core of this book is about oh believe and\nAnd the reason for that is is that is going to be moving if you don't believe in yourself you don't have much and and what we need to figure out the path is an accent is what the cycle of confidence\nWell I certainly thank you for some self help and motivation on and I think the book is wonderfully inspirational\nAnd when I'm finishing all start over from page one because I think there's only\nYou miss that you might need to seep in further to we step by step and vice thought provoking exercises real life stories and the inspiration behind women specifically who have\nBeen there and succeeded your not lost can guide you to a clear path forward\nAnd ... on apologetic ... accept who you are\nAnd that's what it's all about the author Maxine McCoy the book you are not last and inspired action plan for finding your own way and so on the show we do feed your soul maxi thank you for sharing your passion\nThank you so much for having me it's been an honor\nA pleasure to have to have you and not to follow you at Maxine McCoy\nAnd so that brings us to the end of another very hot our with grand gas and chefs chips that I Hope make your dishes and your days come alive which flavor I'll leave you with my last bite my last downs or tidbit of calling every conversation for the hour this is a five ingredient\nMe so Salman that's baked in parts meant that you just have to make\nThe recipe is really simple very healthy I packed with flavor and it comes together in twenty minutes and you know I Love those short cut recipes so you'll combine some brown sugar soy sauce a little bit of hot water and white me so in a tub love that stuff\nAnd your coat some salmon filets then you'll take four large pieces of parts unit paper and sold them in half decrease them then I like to lay down some snow peas or sugar snap peas the salmon on top\nAnd then that me so sauce right over the top of each piece of salmon\nFull departure meant to

Ninety two you know money's going to do with doctors ruin Laurel and hardy with Julia ...\n... ...\nBut Kavanaugh has been sworn in as the newest justice on the Supreme Court Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine tells CNN state of the union that Kavanaugh's demeanor sometimes went too far during his hearing\nAnd that's like the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go over with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial ...\nVery on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week\nStay tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very ah was the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting jak jak as my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and just puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this is this is when you look at her she'd like a big dog you forget but she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd so the the update 'cause people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and boom a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she piece on the patio and colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but\nI Hope so [laughter] anyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week or looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy's producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that the unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for\nPeople to come in and start working still so the economy is strong and so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future of the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market where it falls and crashes it's like this this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a a a couple of months ago we\nReduced the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalents because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up\nAnd ... because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we wanna we wanna make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money

matters with Ken array of course I Am your host Kenmore rape\n[noise]\nSecond jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stuff\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collected\nIt's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kind of things there actually eight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question\nHow how and when I take my Social Security\nAnd what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nOkay so how do you figure that at all well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy it and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our farm we put we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy\nAnd start claim Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually start when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait\nFor every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy it increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive\nThere to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to weigh two you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter]\nIf you don't want and I'll take it [laughter] but uh anyway yeah so if you if you feel that uh you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait till you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired are retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period\nThan we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement\nSo here you got two options won it and they are they all start with going to our website which is money matters dot net okay so the website is money matters dot net now while you're there

E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how you to find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition so essentially\nWhat it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so if they if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle they can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death do you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the cue to trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called de Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but cue tips easier to say\nAnyway if you would like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass on to you the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website it is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit\nNow when we visit this is for those of you are

John just just a couple of days ago I was reading a few articles and one of them that I stumbled upon was why there are no it was titled something along the lines of why there are no cell recommendations and uh the the thing that was the kind of hit me with that is we have that bullish biased that we've been talking about but it really hit me and it's one of the things I've been talking a lot about in my classes\nIs we really have to recognize that we are customers\nWall Street right and their job is just sell us products they selves mutual funds they still ... and they sell us they sell stocks now when you go back through time that they had a broken down in this article where they showed\nWhere they ... they showed that even in the worst financial market conditions the S. and P. five hundred stocks didn't even reach eight ten percent sell recommendation over Ninety percent of all the stocks even during the financial crisis even during the tech boom\nStill had by and or hold recommendations on it and my question to you to be how is that how is that uh uh how is that recommendation that we can trust as far as consumers as far as investors go\nWhen we know the market goes down and the only way to make money has to buy low and sell high yet there's never a recommendation to sell\nWell not only is Wall Street in the business of making money when they sell you a product or service\nThey basically are also acting as the custodian of your assets\nAnd they make most of their money not off transaction fees mulatto people misunderstand how Wall Street really makes money they make money banking your assets when they are the custodian of your assets for instance let's assume you own ten thousand shares of Akron me\nThey have and you give them the right to loan those shares out to third parties are two individuals are institutions that would like to short those shares\nAnd that's where they make their money there is a banking fees that they earn so Wall Street makes most of their money not in what are called darts daily average revenue trades they make their money being the custodian of your assets including being custodian of your cash but\nWall Street always want you to be long equities they never I mean rarely I shouldn't say never but they rarely give us cell recommendation\nBecause it's bad PR and you'll notice if you watch most of the financial media out there\nThey have that same message out there that buying hold works and we have shown data has shown perpetually that buying whole does not work if we're in a bull market buying

could talk about income there's so many different ways to generate income in the financial markets but one of the things Jon that that our listeners are looking for is whenever I talk to her I hear a

best is yet to come\nJohn when I'm Talking to our listeners in classes sometimes it's via social media and I know you have a huge social media presence\nMany of them are saying they don't have enough money to retire and those who do have enough money or not quite sure really even what to do with it especially given the volatility the all time highs everything like that one of the things I'd like to do is just kind of kick a question over to you and see where see where your brilliance actually take this because I'm excited to hear what you have to say on this topic\nWith us being at the all time highs and having that kind of volatility that can come in where in any day we know we can have that four hundred point down or that four hundred point up which is what some of the things that you're really talking to students about or what are some of the things that you're having individuals focus on the instructor teams the new students out here to really protect their retirement accounts\nFrom the volatility while still allowing them to generate more retirement income inside of them\nWell I think the most important thing to do is do the same thing you you did for your automobile do the same thing you did for your home\nAnd maybe even for your life for member when you buy life insurance you're basically buying a replacement income source if something happens to you for your show the income source will take care of your wife and children I think is appropriate would markets being in an all time high\nA and that includes the bond market you know a treasury eels today junior ... over three percent\nIs that we basically need to buy some insurance\nOne of the ways to buy some insurance ... in the stock market could be a couple of strategies one maybe you start to sell down part of your portfolio\nMaybe it's time to take some off the table that doesn't mean it's an all or nothing nothing decision but what if you were to sell Fifteen twenty percent of your portfolio and just go to cash\nWhat if you want to take part of those cash proceeds and buy some put options on the S. and P. as you know the general stock market marks Barry will mark the market\nTo the price volatility BS in pig\nSo I think it's appropriate especially for somebody heading into retirement\nI mean let's face it\nMay be twenty percent of the retirement baby boomer community those of U.S born between Nineteen forty six in Nineteen sixty three have properly funded or on pace to fund our retirement vehicle\nAll of us sooner or later issue so are are well aware Ryan\nWill sooner or later either voluntarily or involuntarily be forced to live off of that retirement bucket\nWe will ... may be a help prevent it may be who knows what you know stuff happens in life\nWe need to be proven at this time especially with the market being an all time highs and the appropriate thing to do if you have some nice capital gains I Would hope you have them in a tax deferred vehicle\nOr like a self directed IRA where you don't have to pay the taxes you get the tax differ into your ultimately start to live out of that bucket but I think it's appropriate with Marcus at or near an all time high and economic challenges on the horizon with the threat of trade wars which\nI don't see going away or I don't see too many parties backing down right now\nThe uncertainty is going to continue what if one was to be prudent and just go to cash or user derivative like put option to buy some insurance let's call it portfolio insurance no different than the fire insurance you talked about on your home\nYou know one of the interesting things about fire insurance and portfolio insurance that they have in common is right now we you know markets are overall going higher and higher which means our portfolio is not on fire right and and saying that we could go\nHouse right now my house is not on fire now I I imagine the market starts to fall apart essentially that means our portfolios are now on fire\nHow much more expensive is fire insurance when the portfolio is on fire\nAnd they always you know or when the house is on fire if the insurance company comes over there like it's on fire or the flood insurance on the east coast absolutely during the time when we need we have to buy it my point what this is we have to purchase the insurance before we need it\nYou have to buy a life insurance before you die got to be proactive absolutely and that's something I Can't stress more and I love that you went down that kind of path on is\nIt is so important that we set this stuff up ahead of time and it's just like the insurance on my car I didn't buy insurance on my car because I plan on wrecking it\nIt's they're just in case one of the things that we can do that help a few people get started with this is where you can really we've got a few more sets the tickets here what if we do another give away to a few more individuals out there really are rolling on this stuff sweet\nIn just a second you can have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving\nNow is the time to pull over half day classes

lot of time on what the students is really building out inappropriate plan for them and everybody has\nDifferent account types different accounts sizes different risk tolerance but when you talk to everybody you get that same common thread of\nBut they also want to generate more income and whether that's income for today or whether that's income for retirement that income word always just shows
