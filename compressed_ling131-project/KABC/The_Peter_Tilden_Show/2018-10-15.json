bond fund a and a oh you're going to be a return in additional fun too I got as alternative to what you have in your portfolio or\nWell we really have presented three possibilities to\nTo invest in depending on the tolerance for risk and I I mean we're we're always open\nTo new ideas but frankly I think right now with the three options that we have I think we're in good shape when how we're dealing with this and either we're going to see a rise in a in the longer term rates or we're running an increasing risk of an inverted yield curve that that does not happen\nUh we're getting we're getting fairly close to a catch twenty two year were either we have to see an increase in long term rates\nWhich many people don't want to see or\nWe run the risk gift that keeps jacking up the federal funds rate that we could get into an area of an inverted yield curve down the road if the long rates uh don't appreciate so it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out but it's going to take some time because right now there's a a decent gap\nBetween the federal funds rate and the ten year treasury rate but right now in addition to the portfolio that we publish\nOr in the investment his letter or a fixed income which has an average duration will bus in one year in addition to that we have two other avenues that we can go down depending on a personal preference\nOne I just mentioned that the caller is the um the CD ladder of the nice thing about the CD ladder is that uh you minimize your interest rate risk because you every three months you have a CD maturing to reinvest at the current rate\nAnd if you take a portfolio and you said it into four pieces three six nine twelve months CDs with FDIC coverage\nThan you are you're rolling on that basis you don't have any credit risk because you have yet the icy and uh you don't have much interest rate risk at all because you're constantly every three months you're rolling into a new CD it prevailing rates\nAnd uh another area that some people choose to go which is fine very convenient is something like vanguard prime money market you're getting your current your right now in excess of two percent and you can even get check writing with that\nYou have total and what did he there and a check writing to go as well with the text of two fifty or more so plenty of a smorgasbord out there to try to avoid the

emergency responders including several fire trucks were stuck in LA traffic\nTrying to respond to some forty people hurt in a bus crash on the four oh five Sunday twenty five people were hospitalized with five of them seriously hurt and the wreck that took place round one PM near ... off\nSmack a little bit of a some kind of concern but he knows as well as I Do that there is no way\nTo get between Fresno and the bay area they are broke and they can't get through\nThe ... and they say so and they have a new some I think uh he knows better and and I I I think he's just very disingenuous ah and I think it demonstrates that danger and the kind of governor that this that this man would\nBe well it doesn't even make sense let's assume they could do it once the need there and he's with the with the whole interview said was\nWe are going to see how it does finish that I don't know what year they're proposing other how based on like you said they don't have the money they don't have a plan\nOr they don't have all the right away it's not going to go to the proper speed on and on on but that said he said we're going to complete that she how it does and then decide on the southern route yet what am I going to ask you let me ask you go ahead\nIt's adopt but it ... it's a dodge I mean he knows that there isn't a a a plan to do that so and and what you gotta look he has the obligation if he's going to do that and then to tell the people of California it's going to be multiple\nBillions of dollars we do have are going to have to raise your taxes are going to have to borrow a whole lot more money and if he really was a governor that mistake\nTrust he'd be saying I'm going to put a halt to this we're going to go back to the voters and we're going to say if you want I speed up this is how we're going to pay for it this is what it's going to cost and now it started with a vote of the people that ought to edit or continue with a bow to the people but he doesn't he pretends like he can build this between Fresno and and\nAgain it's it's ... it's all magic and stupid anyway cannot even say I'm going to cut back and delivered that will be due to you're supposed to go to ... let me ask you this because he was a bigger issue some\nPerson so we go in and vote again another vote coming up in mid term at what point does something you voted for how much difference does it have to be how much does it have to misrepresent what you voted for for to become aware I mean I talk to them a lawyer for trying to shut this down\nI did not vote for this ... ... it's not going to deliver what it said there are so many fallacies in this in so many lives\nUh if you vote for something to vote for it and you eat it you made the decision but this is not what anybody voted for so\nHow is it legal that continues and how I Know when I go to the voting booth next time to vote for a bond I Know they're not going to get a bait and switch this big you say say I'm paying for this and you promised me this and it was completely from ... this is basically from whole cloth\nYeah a a a couple of things one a there is a federal audit under way that I think is going to be even more serious than the audit at the White House doing for the state of California and that is at\n... at questioning whether this whole bait and switch or with federal money a was a breach of the fundamental responsibility of the state of California had with the use of federal money and if that audit which I Believe will demonstrate that that they\nTook a bunch of Obama money they took up a bunch of federal money they knew that they didn't hit they knew that they did not have the property but they\nTook the money shoved into the pipeline spent it and then you had a bunch of ah\nContractors here in central California sitting around for a while if that comes back as I think it will\nThere may be some huge claw backs that the state of California is going to have to cost cough up to the facts I think it could could be a the opening doors here for the various kinds of questions legally that you just waste how far can a state of California or\nMisrepresent in they bait and switch and misrepresent before they get caught I contend that the business plan the very business plan that is presently the operative business plan at vets\nThey have been making these kinds of bait and switch mistakes inside the new director has said we made those mistakes I think they were on purpose because they didn't want to lose the federal money and they've admitted that we're not going to do it again I I I can can that that is that a mission that or the previous\nUm leaders of the high speed rail authority absolutely did a misuse their authority a bait and switch pretended\nThat we're doing one thing while they were doing something else that's a serious breach of the fiduciary responsibility the state of California with federal money to say nothing of their responsibility with California tax money\nYou know it's funny I've real rail and I think that but I rarely gets high speed rail for ages now and it's and it it's not a topic or subject on shoes to real about because I think it's great if you do high speed rail and it works and you get people from\nLA to San Fran in the time allotted that they presented it would be great but you look at high speed rail around the rural South Korea their project just went bankrupt Taiwan most of these projects almost every high speed rail\nNeeds outside funding state funding federal funding or is there only saw a couple of at work when we were also let's not say don't do it\nBut you also have to look at where the world's going now what other options are we going to have in ten Fifteen Years for travel what's air travel are going to look like once on a condom is Nicholas going to look like and then you're asking us for prop six money because of the highways and is this ... does it make sense and nobody it seems like once these projects started going\nThey don't want you to a look at the smell and where the money's going who's being paid for what like USA Today ... spends his days sitting there were giant piece of equipment were they can't move because nobody's bought the required property so they move forward\nI don't know about a tunneling with the mountains no one has ever done that before through fault lines like this\nSo they pick the number on there but and they said this is the number of and it's going to cost and we'll find out if it ever got there that it wasn't the number 'cause they were just guessing but the bigger issue again is that people are gonna start saying no all bond issues are going to start saying no to prompt 'cause they're not going to believe that and as I look at the rainwater tax and I look at the car tax pop six\nIt's the same thing there's no there's no formula there's NO PLAN there is no benchmarks there's no experts who are looking at it with transparency who can actually said oh this is a plant it's always give us some money for the homeless or should give us a billion dollars and then we're kind of trying\nWe're gonna improv it we'll figure it out when you start asking questions will do with these guys did every time there have you and say well now this through this and they're now yes there were problems in the past but moving forward we are we are scrutinizing that's now\n... yeah ... ... we're looking at anybody that had any experience whatsoever with these kinds of large a transportation public projects know that the hallmarks of failure are all over this and in fact um\nWhen the LA Times and ... they are very good reporting on that when you dig down into experts outside of high speed rail in other words the people that high speed rail isn't paying are the ones that have history and experience in this\nTo a person they are saying this is a failure because of the manner in which it's been done at the mistakes that have been made along the way are and what what we get to hear is a ... the ... the\nRidership issue here I think is is part of the the scam if you cannot build between LA and San Francisco a two hour and a half\nA high speed rail trip that cost substantially less than a airplane ticket you don't have a market for it right and white now high speed rail is going to be over three and a half hours now because of the grading that they saying they're doing on either and they they don't have the money even to connect these disparate\nA sections and then you start looking at a hundred dollar one way ticket or now you're now you're beginning to see two hundred maybe two hundred and fifty dollar around by LA San Francisco you know what you can do it you\nKnow I Know I Know I Do I get it I got it I mean there's a big issue for me is and again the scam is they just keep paying and the the the money keeps going to somebody I Hope we can follow where the money went\nSo that we can recoup and I'm guessing at some point the scam will be revealed because they don't have the property broad again telling through the mountains who knows how long are how much or whatever that's going to be but at least\nWhen I saw that that he's admitted and he's making it look like it's a stopgap measure because I'm being responsible and saying we're going to continue building up in for that segment I stood out my morning coffee because they thought oh I Can't believe we're still going for this I Can't believe nobody's standing up and saying you know what\nWe need to stop it and put this money somewhere else we've got ... record revenues right now we should put this in ...\n... ... ... ... this is how bad the fraud goes um\nI sit on the budget committee I set on several oversight committees I have looked into this dug into this or as long as I've been in the legislature the bottom line here is this is a fast of the gas tax money uh and and and they are increasing the taxes or automobiles and the like light

before you as a voter go yeah I Want you to be a bit more accountable I think I Need more details I think I have to ask more questions and you have to provide more answers apparently they don't

would get jobs that it would move along the route people can live further out because of real estate so expensive the problem is\nIt appears that the misrepresented every step of the way what was

because they threatened\nThat they're going to start buying insurance for me because I did not have proof from insurance\nSo I called them and I talk to them a week or two ago and I said I Do have proof of insurance and I sent it to them a couple of times\nSo then I got a bill in the mail for insurance as if they didn't receive it so I called them back I finally got to their to the right department and they said oh yeah you're sure instance here but we just don't talk to the other department and I said well I did talk to the other department and I said please call me\nWhen you get my

how hard it is to cause\nHe tried to call me doesn't cut it with me so I said please do me a favor making note on my account that I didn't call you didn't try I actually called you spoke to you\nAnd

... could not have been stronger now Jarrett who's friendly with the prince who has a ...\nGoing to be the next king they're saying that he has not a whole lot of discipline\nThat he's new and he\nDoesn't have a lot of experience and is consolidating his power and even though he's a reformer as long women to drive and doing a couple of other things which is good PR ... he's a wrestling is arresting other princes throwing people went to jail or indeed potentially knew about the murder because number one\nA king Solomon did he know did you not know well if it was premeditated in a range if they're going to go over there and jets and take this guy the royal family not knowing is pretty pretty out there that they wouldn't know uh\nTrump said well didn't happen in our country so he's talking about human rights violations if if they don't happen here he's OK with it but the interesting thing here for me is\nHow we deal with foreign countries and foreign dictators because I found this to be really interesting that usually presidents don't talk about\nHow we look the other way when we deal with dictators we need whether it's for oil whether it's for geography cut off he was a friend two thousand six a full diplomatic relations with what sector steak Congolese arise\nSaid that Libya's leadership was a model for others to fall so human rights violations not so much\nSo and then all of a sudden the U.S has military and you know intervention and done um we had Iran in the fifties late fifties are interference there and aren't surfing into their became what are we trained brutal secret police sold sophisticated arms\nAnd we called Reza the policemen in the Persian Gulf Saddam Hussein so now we've got king Solomon a Jared Kushner through in figuring that the the prince the prince would be the guy\nWho would consolidate power and help them with the middle east and help them with Iran or the problem is they don't have constitution rule of law independent judiciary so it it's a country that has human rights violations obviously but he threw in thinking this was going to be the way to go\nIn solving the middle east problem now they got a wide ranging problem on the hand but it's fascinating to hear the president say what other presidents have never said publicly but they all say privately we can't afford to just\nHim an enemy because we need them for the geography we need him for help in the middle east um we need him because he's investing money in our economy\nSo he actually was very honest about\nHow you have to deal with a foreign country but I've never heard an interview before it was an honest answer about we need we need this relationship so he's right now trying to deal with how this is going to play out\nSo that everybody can save face I'm with a guy who potentially cut up a journalist and shipped amount of boxes\nSo where's that where's that going to go how's that going how's that going to end or as climate change a hoax he said after years claiming that it is a hoax backed away from that characterization always those who said not certain that it's done by human beings are or what our role is not\nA he said we've been a stupid country as far as NATO and we've been paying for most of NATO's bill which is not a hundred percent accurate and all I can get into that if you want me to talk about that in a little bit ... and his love affair or the Leslie stall kept pointing out\nAll of human rights violations there and why do you say you you you get in ... he fell in love with this guy and you have good chemistry and ah she she led all the violations human rights violations that can be on a has done and here's what the president said back\nI had an age the sanctions haven't done anything [noise] I haven't done anything for me I Believe he likes me I can have a good relationship to important\nAnd then we fell in love [noise] [noise]\nWe found\nOne every jail his resume okay for inside over a cold can last for freshman\nCool lives starvation reports that he had his half brother assassinated slave labor public executions this guy you know these things I mean I'm not a baby and I think a lot of that guy\n[noise] again I have a ... that's it's like hey you know it's like an ... well let me in a bracelet if they want to hear that John\nLennon the whatever it is I get along with them really well I have a good energy with another good chemistry ... look at the horrible threats or no more threats no more threats\nSome good interview that there's something by the way the president the unnoticed has been all over the media and are coming into the terms of strategy is to be in every news cycle he's doing rallies right now\nHe's at the scene of the flooding in Florida I'm visiting there and then he's going to go yet to another rally\nAnd he's been out there in a big way answering questions from I'm not necessarily friendly media which is kind of fascinating and he's again talking about Saudi Arabia um he also talked about General Mattis being sort of a Democrat it sounds like Mattis\nSince the Woodward book since he actually said that he was trying to explain to Trump\nThe president about the north Korea South Korea situation that could be the start of World War three and apparently when he left the meeting said it's like talking to a fifth grader maybe maybe that is what's a what's forcing\nHis hand when it comes to General Mattis or maybe General Mattis has had it but he's pretty respected and seemed to be studying force in the White House but it looks like he may based on his interview he may be a leaving a and the other thing that's kind of fashion and getting back to Saudi Arabia for a minute\nThey kind of floated for the first time that they made a veiled threat to use oil as a weapon um which they have never done before at least not since the seventies so because it's usually considered out of bounds because they could bring the world\nTo their knees if they decided to do that um and a an opinion piece was panned\nBy a Saudi who heads of state on news network and they pulled it back after he did this op ed piece but saying if President Trump has angered by eighty dollar world nobody should rule out the price coming to a hundred dollars and two hundred dollars about maybe double that figure\nSo or the ... the energy Mr then pulled back and said no no no no no no no we will honor that we're not going to politicize oil\nUm and they're the biggest they're the biggest they could bring the global economy way way way way way too early to to a bad bad bad place they pump one in ten oil barrels worldwide\n'em and all the spare capacity available in case there's an outage they just about have all of it so hinting about it can drive the market's up and it would be destabilizing\nOr to the world so in Nineteen Seventy three Seventy four was the embargo and the second or crisis in Seventy nine which destroyed all demand and that's when all consumption became lower today than it was in Seventy four and Germany and Japan and France because of what the cars and 'cause we are trying to find alternative sources\nAre but that threat first time first time since the seventies um critics of the president of the president's ration say the Kirchner\nHas been naive to trust\nThe ruler over there and his allowed himself to be manipulated by an ascendant royal because he doesn't have the experience so in in a intel report said that they are concerned that he's being manipulated so\nOf course he and the president and the partnership feel that the pay dividends in the form of a pledges to purchase billions of dollars worth of us weaponry if you look up you know the president's talking about a hundred billion dollars worth of stuff that they're going to be ... that they're buying\nThat's not necessarily true they made that pledge way back to Obama\nAnd they bought a couple of billion dollars and stuff here and there but they've never sunk through it's like a note of intent that never gets kind of completed they're not buying it so that kind of yanking us with that so far like I said it's been a couple of bills here and there um but the\nThe threat of them not\nComing through and spending this money is also concerning uh as far as them the president also said that they would give then go to Russia for arms are trying to farms have problem with that is when you have a military it's based on United States stuff's tanks planes whatever it's really hard to convert over to another country's military\nBecause we've got the training you've got the equipment you've got the supplies you've got the replacement parts that takes years to segue\nSo that's a little bit tougher than he's presenting it but you know what are they an ally\nAre they not um it's gonna be it's going to be really really interesting to see how the rest are allies play this out and once I'm you got my compare over there my guess is they're gonna have to do something\nTo show the optics that they took care of it that the Saudis took care of it\nAnd then we will move on to do something big enough to say look we did it but we didn't know about it but we handled it uh because of not that's going to be held to pay if you want to comment on that eight hundred to two to five to to do it's a big story it's a very big story but we do have a history of having our enemies bureau firms in our friends being are enemies\nSay it'd be see news live and the local at eleven thirty I'm Rob ... the C.

circumstance is good for him so here's my question to you should CEOs of big companies\nState their political opinions should they stake out for their branding a political line on the big issues of the day or should they just stay out of it I'm more and more CEOs are stating what they believe in\nToday's world social media amplifies that usually it was never mix business and politics and\nSome experts say you know what you shouldn't do it however staying quiet now could have a downside\n'cause a CEO the position and the way a company feels and brands himself could influence employer recruitment and retention especially younger workers I guess are expecting a company to make a statement about how they feel about maybe gay rights or gun rights and more and more CEOs I guess that are being active\nUm and we're ... more polarized than we've ever been to society so it's harder and harder and harder to live in that middle ground\nWithout being drawn into some kind of sometimes a fight that you have to stick up for so more and more CEOs now are joining the fight and making independence dating an opinion and and they don't they don't seem to care it depends on the company I'm Levi Strauss see your trip bird\nSaid that he was anticipating impassioned responses when he made a corporate donations one million dollars toward preventing gun violence last month\nHis quote as I knew I was going to get a lot of hate mail I knew it was going to get threats I knew my family was gonna get threats and all that has happened but somebody's got to have the courage to step up and say something needs to be done now gosh you're Levi Strauss they've been around eight billion years maybe\nThere is no backlash or maybe there isn't by like would you not buy from a company if they made a donation let's say like this gentleman did a a million to preventing gun violence um some angry emails Broadway came from his own employees who interpreted the donation\nAs being hostile to gun ownership he happens to be an army veteran he says it\nWas not about that uh he also got a lot of support including from Levis employees\nAnd some of my children who were on lockdown at schools because of active shooters either way he says it's not a movie regrets she says activism from supporting desegregation to algae beat he writes has long been part of California at the California based companies history they may not always agree with every single position\nOr stand\nThat were taken but they appreciate the fact that we're willing to dive into these tough issues so is this the way to go where companies now are going to be expected in the future to be partisan and have their leaders make some kind of statement to connect I mean everybody's trying to connect it does by the way",
