they're saying it's hard to believe some streets in the district had not been paid for eighty up to eighty years\nIt could tell me please call me eight hundred to two to five to to do and tell me how in today's world that's possible that they don't do audits that they don't have any kind of updates um any kind of computerized tracking\nOf that uh it while I I I Am just done tomato based on to the public works is looking at it now and they're saying boy constituents reach out to us\nAnd my street ... years they say they can't be the case they finally ... I Wonder how they finally figured it out a report found that multiple ordinances and other city council actions as far back as the thirties\nAnd withdrawing street from public use and that in general those ordinances authorized and direct the public works to return streets to public use when they found to be safe and passable so I Know about blowing themselves district ... district in the San Fernando valley\nAs eighty four eighty four streets [laughter] since who was president ah it just it stunk Hollywood Hills as eighty one and more than that\nIt shows you that we\nDon't have a system in place for track\nThose those streets were complained about in the last eight years numerous times we don't have a system in place for this um the decision to withdraw the streets was caused by state statutes have since been repealed\nAnd it was intended in part to prevent liability claims against the city for damage\nFrom defective streets so I can now go down at St destroy my car or have be injured and then sue the living daylights out of the city because I can say they let it they let it sit for for eighty years\nUh I I I'm I'm shocked and and you pair that by the way with what we're doing with the road diets and somebody wrote a great piece in the daily news about bait and switch from the government buildings which is what I've been saying for a long long long time\nThat we're talking about vision zero BS\nBecause if they really cared about vision zero they wouldn't be be driving people from neighborhoods where um you have resident residential houses of apartment buildings never intended to be a thoroughfare because it's dangerous because kids are playing and grandparents are sitting on the sidewalk and dogs are running free\nDriving traffic down those streets makes no sense so the fact that they know they're doing it they have to know they're doing it unless they're mutants the fact that they're doing it and yet looking us in his face and saying this is about safety it's about\nIt's not about transit mobility it's about all about real estate development and the high density housing so we're proof four and a half cent tax increases since Nineteen eighty to pay for transit projects but if you noticed\nThat metro ridership is down at his peaked in the eighties uh went by late when metro is just a bus system and the spending continue to continue to increase loss of ridership is happening and what they're doing the study to determine where people in LA county\nWould like to go for metro and this person writes than I have to laugh out loud you know what they want to go Nevada Arizona taxes either Wyoming get me the hell out of here 'cause I Can't drive anywhere I Can't get anywhere anymore\nA metro ... it's Steve and I were talking about junior Steve the other day he said why don't you take the line because you don't live that far from Santa Monica and I said Steve\nI live probably four miles from Santa Monica but it takes me half an hour to get there but I tried the other day so I drove there 'cause I Want to be a good citizen and see if I can use rail so I go to Santa Monica and then you drive around the station that has no parking\nSo did they really want to get me out of my car if you don't put in parking and I can't get out of my car to go to the train\nWhat's what's the purpose it's ... it's futile or it's a big lie so they look at upcoming transit and we're going to put transit and then they have all of the uh the all of the sequel if your environmental quality act and they let these developers will give them money to get reelected\nBuild up and build up and build up and you know what the lie as then then they look at you and say look at the ...\nLook and look at the lack of affordable housing you did it you're the guys who were doing it every ... I'm not doing it you're the guys who are doing it\nYou are the people who are responsible for the lack of affordable housing your the people who are responsible for what Doug said Twenty one businesses left mar vista in the last year and a half where the taxes that used to get from those businesses how you were placing the taxes for that you're making impossible\nFor commercial real estate you're making it possible for um ... for for retail ... empty retail stores are because people just can't get there and yes the Internet competes but man it's become so untenable\nTo get somewhere and its development along these corridors where the transit lines are or where they say they're coming and they may not even be there for decades these developers\nGet a chance to put up

you're creating havoc\nYou're making it harder for people\nTo get to work they have to move further out and you keep coming back and saying give us more money because we know how to do this and you had three hundred and Seventy four streets that you didn't even know under your nose\nThat hadn't been paid for eight years and didn't know the city had written them off how is that possible on our grid in today's world that you didn't know a let's go to ... see me how good morning\nOh how are you there what do I not hear how how\nI'd hair or oh you talk to me while I'm I'm kind of outraged about the situation is venison these people losing their businesses so I did sort of quickie research this morning about inverse condemnation law California's pretty tough standard\nBut it seems to me that the change in the street with those bollards is substantial factor and all these businesses closing they might have a good claim as they get a good attorney and I think as much as I like to see our tax money spin on it that maybe these people should make an attempt to get some of that money\nYou know the problem is with mom and pop businesses and the guy we talked about did very well in his music business for years\nThey don't have the money or the energy obsessively have enough people together maybe it's a cloud and and you know council to do it I hear you but then you're going to have to prove the intent I'm ...\nAnd they're going to say it was for the good of the city it was too you know ... remember vision zero is to get to zero traffic deaths\nBy ... trying to figure out of it is really for the good of anybody again\nLook at the city look at the city around you I've lived here now since eighty eight eighty nine [noise]\nI've never seen a change like I have in the last five

with to shift them around to move them around and we suspect and look at the density this happening here and yes we need to make housing for folks because the city is growing on the other hand man driving a lot of businesses out and it's and it's frustrating also\nIs also set in the old comic strip we have met the enemy and he is us\nWell and they're they're greedy they're greedy and they'll never admit that it's all about developer money I mean for years I was out here and they made it really hard to build now it's the other they went completely the other way\nThat you want to throw up a

Evan o'clock I'm Rob or into the state's political watchdog agency says LA county may have violated a California law regulating campaigns\nDo you guys and does Washington and different outlets there are they looking at the polling skeptically because they go we're in a new environment here we can't trust him because I'm seeing some places gone oh\nDefinitely the Democrats are going to take the house and I think there'll be able to keep the Senate if you're if you keep the Senate is their fear there that maybe you should be a little bit more cautious\nI think it depends from place to place and I can I can speak for myself and I would say that I Am I Am trying to remain cautious about it\nYou know not only do we do we see a a you know notice little example twenty sixteen where the polls were not lay off but enough off that people really overestimate of Hillary Clinton's chances and when you have\nFour hundred thirty five races so there's there's much more margin for error they are all these things that can change their local ... their national factors we've also seen that voter enthusiasm is is doing interesting things in both parties\nWe've seen um results that defied the polling um both right into left in in special elections and in primary elections so you know I I think it's it's safe to say that most of the polling looks good for Democrats in the house but I Do think that a little bit of caution is is\nWise and you see Nate Silver going out and saying just that are just not fair to say anything so a lot of outlets are being waged confident about what Paul he says\nI Would think because people again it is how you ask the questions how people are motivated today and and there's so much that's fine artist in a in a twenty four seven period\nDoes not like it's ever been historically were story last more than twelve minutes you know what I mean it's like why does that resonate capital for your time and I was going to drive people are kind of felt like it was ten years ago at this point right so much has happened wait a minute cabinet and the music is unbelievable how fast and furious and stuff is long so I don't know\nHow you can figure out what resonates with folks what is going to motivate them to come out on the Democratic side on Republican so I Do have a handle on what is the issue the single issue that's going to drive voter\nDemocrat is all over the place um health care seems to be a major one I think a lot of people are very upset about cabinet that's also a major motivating factor on not among Republicans\nIs interesting these are the first time in decades that Democrats have been as\nEnergized by the should of course the Republicans habits vision and something that Republicans were really motive for about we saw this in twenty sixteen Trump talking about how the Supreme Court was a reason why conservatives would have to vote for him whether they disapprove of or not [laughter]\nIt's only now you said Democrats fired up about that as well um immigration is being for Republicans in the range of issues sometimes we had election where there's one big issue that that motivates both sides and I think it's a much more fractured situation here probably get the economy is doing well and and there are no major crises on the international stage\nAnd what are we heading into if if we may look past the midterms which are a moment away you got a potential Jeff Sessions being gone you got to potential Rosen's name\nBeing gone you got ... being sentenced you've got Manafort you've got Michael Cohen who's now campaigning as a Democrat Democrat and we'll go out there and give interviews\nTo reveal how bad the White House's you also have word now that more is going to release after the midterms some limited information about I guess the big issues with ... uh an obstruction\nWhile we're heading into a lot of information they got the New York times story which kind of limped off in the sun said about the president's finances and his dad and loans and doing illegal stuff and he got ... out there saying\nThe kids are going to be I Can't wait to the kids were indicted so this is all in the mix and we're right what do we anticipating was among the investigation coming to an end understand Rosen seen as kind of\nSaying hey man's speed this thing up already give give us some details here because we can't live under this umbrella in the shadows questionable shadow for much longer\n[noise] yeah I'm interested in the airport I I'm a little bit cautious about that you know we much of all we know about Mueller comes from other people [noise] um and so that makes it hard to know how seriously to take things the question is is this a sincere things happening on and he was going on or someone then Justice Department sort of trying to pressure Muller\nTo release things by going to the press and it's hard to sort of gas or the smoke and mirrors are in the situation but we know presumably there will be more familiar there continues to be as you said you've got just incredible range of things to go on [laughter] plus you know we don't know what Congress will look like the Democrats take the house they're going to be a lot of investigations coming from there and so and it's going to be kind of wild west I suspect\nIn the ... President Trump's his hand and he said if it's if the midterms we lose the house it's not my fault does that mean as he's getting into it looks like if he's already been putting that out there\nIs that uh you know premeditated where he didn't just said that he he knows something that maybe we don't know that has the ...\n[noise] well I just I think some of the same polling that that a lot of us are seeing you know the Republican Party is doing polling as well and and so they have a guess about what things are going to happen I think it's kind of classic thing you see politicians\nThe head of the result of they think might not be good kind of start to set expectations and and shift the blame elsewhere and if it turns out well he'll celebrate it and take take credit I'm sure but if it turns out poorly he wants to distance himself\nBut remember he had that whole um ... the whole team working for him that that was pretty specific about the polling information that they got and how they managed to run their campaign and I'm Wondering if he's using that\nKind of analytical from to get more more accurate polling information\n[noise] yeah it's hard to say my guess is that in a situation like this in his team is not going to get done polling I totally this is something that he would leave the are in the end of the you know the Republican congressional committee is ah for for racist but I don't I don't know for sure actually\nAnd then like with the AP interview we're we're talking about climate change he's talking about a lot of stuff again getting back to the Saudis we got Mike Pompeo who's also saying and he was just there and he talked to turkey and you you brought up the fact that yes it's questionable turkey may have an agenda here\nUm with Mike Pompeo coming back is he doing is so far from what you are 'cause I didn't your comments this morning as he walked in the same line as the president being very cautious\nHe is yeah you know he said he he didn't he didn't ask is how about facts and they didn't offer them he said well he he talked about was the need to have a full investigation so there you have something in keeping options open or not it may make show not pre judging but but sort of trying to push for some sort of accountability at least on a on a basic process level\nAnd listen to the war and walking around like a zombie today go on that I Believe that it could I have played that worse uh who's advising her body weight and said yeah right before the midterms you want to put out the your one one eighty millions of some kind of\nA Native American and he's not going to push back he's going to say you gosh I'm Sorry I didn't realize and here's a million dollar check [laughter] thinking it was going to let somebody say let's play out where this could actually go\nYou know I think the only charitable read of it has that she hopes are written demanded off now in the hopes that that it's neutralized you know one year to year down the line and it it's no longer an issue\nUm I don't know whether that will be true or not but any case it's it's amazing that here we are a couple of days to three days later and she still talking about it I I don't see this is a short term political winter [laughter] I don't know why they're still talking\nStudying you go on one level I mean just the basic uh advertising and marketing one on one guy would say shut up go away for a while also have Hillary Hillary built time their tour I Know they're going to make a lot of my time their tour so that they can also interesting interrupt\nAnd impact the midterms and what's coming next I mean it's kind of incredible\nI you know I I don't know what the conversations were like on their end but I Know there are a lot of Democrats are shaking their heads or when they saw that knew that it's bad messaging for the party [noise] uh and I think there are people who wish that the Clintons would just quietly go away at this point oh you\nDemocrat will you know and I'm looking at millennials do we have any any sense of millennials will turn up awash millennials I have a millennia\nAnd everybody thought while they're going to they're going to turn out they're going to really turn out big time but remember they were slammed too because if they if they were behind burning the Democrats the their religion or the politics is really dirty and guess what even your own party is sabotaging the guy that you think you like\nSo you put down into the mix and you are they gonna turn up ... what does your polling say what are you saying\nYou know I didn't go we're going to say more millennial turnout than we're used to part of that is just millennials are getting older they're all a bigger portion of the electorate I think you'll see more of them the question I mean but\nIt's hard to guess how far they're hard to poll because a lot of polls reliant landlords landlines most millennial don't have landlines\nUm there are a little bit less predictable and their voting patterns so it's hard to say I think to a certain extent some of those ah Bernie Hillary battles had been neutralized you know people are now [laughter] I'm energized about different issues with that's a resistance to Trump or they're concerned about health care or what have you on but actually mean they were going to huge huge turnout and and I think\nSay it'd be see news live
