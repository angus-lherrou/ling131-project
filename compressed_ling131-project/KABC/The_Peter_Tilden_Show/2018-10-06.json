their\nLarry's we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush biased that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe he could take that into it into a expand on that with for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right on the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around some education the problem is to very costly lesson why would you want to spend all that time energy and money\nWhen you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money and so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs\nThere were ... large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use the analogy hurt me use it before it's like driving a car if anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go in drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the markets are going down and what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... coming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's ... who's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything that's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside my classes that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focus on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets and and and when I talk to people is very normally that did they say\nAnd I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate the income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income scale has to come first and it's the the patience of developing a skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody is successful or not it's just like I I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on\nOn how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane of across the country that's a that's a whole different conversation and\nWe would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money it's a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves to\nAbsolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over

operation here that's for sure you shouldn't some light on how to make money to the markets are going up down her side was how to generate more\nMoney how to generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole the whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying in the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like\nWell starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolutions is what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and this is something that a lot of students come in and out of the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in\nThey don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know it they're\nGetting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities what I talk to students about the biggest concern is right now is\nWhat if we have another major correction wherever they're going to be able to make up that income and you know it's not a question anymore\nIf it's when we're already starting to see reminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people\nKenya as part of her first solo international trip her spokesman

Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and having structure it on I mean really shed some light on income ... we talked a lot about multiple streams of income we\nTalked about different types of income passive income active in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active income\nAnd and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow and I'm not income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment\nTalking to a little bit about the retirement accounts and so one of the things that may be missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more a more generating more income well don't worry we're gonna be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation whether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come\nAnd Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot via social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRave got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics 'cause I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ... one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now is historically statistically the markets and to correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier in the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first thing we got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade and mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world in Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss is set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside to separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people and senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes well right now you should be thinking about especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira or four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever see that index of been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nYeah and the the the\nWay to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down\nIt's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time high as as being you buy low opera opportunity right can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the marks or going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for uh\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nBathroom there are a speed through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now is the markets are collapsing or financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs\nOffsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with this which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nWal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer as the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and\nIf that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the with the\nKind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes how do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there's it's OK let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area the happy classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your past this is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside her kid makes it so you just started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight and eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with the retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight back I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction\nAt some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you had the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your say retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you so what you have to start doing right now is thinking well\nIf I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating money you need to retire the right way and again\nShe's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she'd recently gone through a divorce and which is added to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough and had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you can pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nYou know what I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life you know we talk a lot about financial freedom that's that's\nReally what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually came up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty for your call here in the wintertime when I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection and we've joked about it a few times where he where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I I was ... down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop and even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for like eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who's just getting started right now it's like\nIt's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk up pill both ways and the snow you know he had dial up Internet too and now it's just in the palm of your hand but we have so much access to our money that really\nGoing in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand identify the price we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather telling me that's when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy ... shares of stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is it the half the class we've got a few tickets left before the show's over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay alright right now we've got to have to add class coming up in your area that have their classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be the professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional and Saturday it makes it so you can get started\nRight now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWere some of the other kind of examples you can share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom splits\nConsistency Ryan most people come in and they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit ... be at a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now then you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do with who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact I'm Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there you\nKnow I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nAnd he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach our students\nHow they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got now one of the ways that where we start this off one of the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time pass and let's get some people educated changed their lives our right well right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're going to have a chance to win it said it passes the one of these half their classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over include with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kit\nNow this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland says the president wants a loyalist on the court\nDuring his campaign candidate Trump said he was going to pick Supreme Court nominees based not on who would be impartial\n[noise] I I think when it that\nThey very important and critical aspects state you in ... case they're starting to happen is a perception of change\nThat those people that we all encounter daily who we perceive as homeless so often it's easy for us to say\nOh they they don't take care of themselves they want to be on the street they don't want help we're not going to be able to help them and we basically turn our backs on them and turn to turn a blind eye because they're the cause of their problem\nBut what I have seen in our city jail in an instrument or late for you add inning leadership and what Greg brains it's this perceptual change that no no no by and large majority of the people who had\nThis found themselves on the streets are people just like us who very recently had a job in a home or an apartment and they were able to put food on the cable and because of an economic acute economic problem\nThey've had their carpet ripped out from under down there and they land on the street and they just need a little help to regroup\nIsn't that true that the majority of the people on the streets are of that second category\nYeah when you think about who's homeless in a place like Los Angeles or most places the country I I make a distinction the folks who are experiencing chronic homelessness and shorter term homelessness and in LA it's around a third of the people we're almost at any given night who are chronically homeless and there's a technical definition but basically it's people have been homeless for a long period of time are struggling with serious issues\nBut the other two thirds are much more who you're talking about and short term homelessness the statistic that really brings that to light to me is that between two thousand and two dozen Thirteen and the county of Los Angeles the median rents went up by twenty seven percent and the media and rent or income went down by seven percent\nDo you have an enormous number of families who are really precariously perched just one thing going wrong away from homelessness one last job\nOne domestic violence incident one ... ah illness and the family one thing going wrong and they're over that hump and they're into homelessness and it's just devastating to see the number of families and individuals who are perch just that one step away\nAnd there's a lot that we can do from a policy standpoint than republic standpoint to intervene and help families who are facing those challenges and keep them from becoming almost\nAdam if you've done any good have you do have some people that were homeless and because of the inner cities and next thing you know they're they're back\nYou know Thomas ... which is probably the most rewarding thing about being an inner city last centers that literally every day there are families who stay in their homes who get into homes who get access to public benefits who get paid money from the slum lord to have been running their buildings\nFrom a

and Greg Spiegel the director of strategy and Greg Spiegel the director of strategic initiatives and even though we are talking about the issue on a Los Angeles for them\nAnd even though we are talking about the issue as it relates to Los Angeles what we're talking about today is being seen and mirrored in every major city across our nation the problems are the same and the solutions can also be the same um you're\nTalking about getting people off of homelessness getting off the street and yet somebody listening to this might be thinking okay but\nHow do you move them from dependence upon various services to self sufficiency and Adam I kind of make this akin to when I was a child I had a very serious illness\nAnd I literally on learned walking off because of the illness I could not walk right afterwards I had to really learn to walk many of the people who are homeless walked couldn't walk\nWe have to train them to walk again we have to be able to an enabled them to walk again as an analogy\nHow do we do that\nToday I think it's a there's a different answer that depending on who you're talking about interacting with I think one of the things that's very important in what Greg said is that there were many pathways into homelessness and there are many pathway out of homelessness\nAnd you really have to figure out where that individual is the individual person individual family and what they need to transition out of homelessness and that's a different depending on on why they're homeless they shot there and what they're struggling with now um\nBut we we see a lot of families in particular who become homeless recently for economic reasons who are either to get back into a working environment to get back to a job to get back to a staple living environment and they really just need a short term assistance to do so\nUm so they need they had something that's pushed him over the edge into homelessness they lost a job they had an illness and the family and they just need to I was saying for that six to twelve months a cushion to get back on their feet and get back where where they where they want to be and why they're eager to be\nWith the other folks who need more intense at helping them that we need job training services or health services or something else to get there and so that's more akin to what you're talking about I also think it's important for us to just be honest about the fact that there is also a number of folks\nWho need assistance or going to need assistance for the rest of their lives you know there there we emptied or mental institutions onto the streets decades ago\nThat I really that's really an issue in other words are you from the police department standpoint so much of the crime or these people who have mental issues that should be being served in that fashion and they're just all out in the street\nThat's right and the police are called out again and again to be the front lines of interacting with folks which is not the healthiest way to do it in the most productive way to do it but there's a subset of the folks who are chronically homeless whom need permanent supportive housing are likely to have that support for the rest of their lives [noise]\nUm that's the main thing to do I know if someone in my family was living on the streets with a serious mental health issue and needed help for the rest of their life I Would want us to provide that and everybody who's out there was somebody saw under somebody's daughter somebody's family member so I think we just have to own that but that's not the bulk of who's on the streets on but it is important that we recognize the bulk\nTruly are people that have this problem and then they get out and get back and so forth yes and the statistics are overwhelming on that I mean it okay if I Want to know those 'cause that's really important\nYeah so so you're looking at about almost forty seven thousand people who are homeless every night\nAbout Thirteen thousand or thereabouts are chronically homeless and that's the subset where there are serious mental health issues and long term assistance is needed the balance of the other folks are mostly going to transition with the right support services back into jobs and apartments and lives as we think about them\nFor a really so about thirty thousand plus you think are going to get back and so forth\nIt's even more than that because that's the nightly count right so that's forty seven thousand every night but over the course of the year it's probably a little bit more than three times that that are experiencing homelessness\nAnd almost all of the difference between the two hundred thousand over the course of the year and the forty seven thousand on on each night are folks who are short term homelessness\nThat's like putting all those people into Dodger Stadium and you fill it up yet and Norman's number of people\nIt's I think about that at every single one of them as as a human being was literally sleeping in a shelter sleeping on the streets you know Greg yet and I was going to add ... Saddam was saying I often I hear people say well the homeless person I Know they don't they don't want to house they don't want to be off the street they want to live on the streets and\nWhat we know is that I'm most homeless people don't want to be in a shelter or our traditional shelters have\nBeen something you have to line up in the afternoon to get in with all your stuff and there's a crowd and you you line up and people pushing shove and then you get you may be asleep on the floor or a bad but it's it's not your ideal situation some people don't feel safe it's not on the shelters have limitations about who they take and who they don't take\nSome if you have an addiction problem you know welcome others have religious or service requirements that they don't want to do so people with mental illness was serious issues that's not an attractive situation so\nThere are many many people who don't want shelter but there are very few people who turned down housing and that's why that's the solution is permanent housing\nAlmost everyone will come off the street if you have permanent housing that fits what they need the other thing I Want to say is that\nFor those people that need that permanently need help and we need to accept that and its services it's actually cheaper to house them and serve them than it is to lead them on the street also on the street these are people who are not functioning so they are\nHad serious mental illness or perhaps drug addiction or both um and they are passing out on conscious and they get picked up by an ambulance and they're taking to the emergency room and there's a police an ambulance crew involved in there's tons of labor it's thousands of dollars the estimates for the the most acute\nTop ten percent of homeless people cost the county of Los Angeles about eight thousand dollars a month if we ... them and provide them services it's like three thousand dollars a month we actually save money by doing the right thing if you talk about\nThey don't want to be homeless and I've mentioned this picture before but it has a different perspective and when I used to ride the train into Los Angeles\nOr along the Los Angeles river underneath the freeways you would see on occasion a little towns suddenly being built\nWould call them you know shanty towns\nBut what occurs to me is this as I watch those towns develop those people were building their own homes they wanted a place to live it wasn't just attempt\nThese were scraps of would they were able to scrounge and they were building their own homes and their own community they wanted a sense of home of community of belonging to a group of people\nAnd then about every three months of you know enforcement would come in and just literally bulldozed the entire area and those people were gone but it occurs to me that that is a demonstration that people really do want a home\nThat is so well said Dave exactly and so they don't have the home out there that it can afford or that is addressing the needs that they have and they recreate it and they're improvising and as you say it's not just one lean to on its own people start living in community they're replacing", "show_name": "The Peter Tilden Show", "station": "KABC", "day": "06", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
