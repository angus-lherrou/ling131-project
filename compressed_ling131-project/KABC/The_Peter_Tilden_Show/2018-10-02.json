about how and why the left wants us to act like a mom\nIt's October and you know that means an important holiday is coming up\nUh it's no more showed day is coming up by October night not many people know about this we're trying to educate people about the fact the shape of our was a mass murder and you know a fascist and a killer and a coward and all kinds of wonderful things so I found this quote from shape of our which I've never heard before which really speaks into this present moment\nIf but Kavanaugh ... said you should learn to think and act as a mash it his criminal to think as individuals as criminal thinkers individuals and I'm thinking what is it about the left\nWhy did they love mumps why did they love turning us\nInto thoughtless I'm thinking mobs moms have certain you know the ... of love this from you know the French Revolution at least but they they always depended on mobbed to follow their charismatic leaders and they're angry grievances whatever it is they get to the way they binder together and of course the reason is in part\nThat when you were in a mob your identity gets fused into the mob and this is what psychologists say that you're no longer yourself you are now this group your conscience\nGets to the news you know longer blame yourself for the things that you're doing it's everybody everybody was doing and we were all lynching it you know every everybody was doing it so it wasn't you and you've got it kind of takes the moral weight of your actions off your shoulder and that means you can be organized into a group of\nUs versus them you can be in a kind of the moral panic will sweep you along\nAnd and so we're ever\nAnd what is it the west is trying to overcome what it why do they need a mom to overrun thing for what they need is\nAmerican traditions American Jurisprudence they need to mom to over on our sense that man is innocent until proven guilty that we shouldn't do that a person who was accused of something has a right\nTo find evidence against him not evidence that things happen to these things occurred it doesn't matter if other people have been raped that doesn't mean the man being used as a rape is\nSo what ever there is an injustice whether it's real or imagined they want to organize us into a mob so if a cop shoots a guy in Chicago and the guy is black and the cop is white\nThey want to organize us into black and white it's the blacks elm I ... white cops or can we watch out again and again and again and again\nStudies even by leftist organizations have shown that cops are not killing black where not\nKilling black people out of a you know out of order of it's just not it's not happening they've shown it again and again and yet if you can convince people that that is going on you can turn them into a mob and that is the way that you overcome the breaks that American society has built\nOn on mom passions me which was the great fear of our founders the mom was a great fountain furor founders\nThey wanted the people to have power but they knew that people could be easily organized into a mob and so they were afraid of that and that's why that all these systems for breaking power for putting some power over here and some power over there to oppose it and for everybody to be fighting with each other so that nobody gets carried away into this one and the left is trying to overcome\nSo Brett Kavanaugh they've got the votes on the committee Jeff Flake\nThey never actually traced it back to him right uh actually excuse me that was the anthrax that was an ashtray I wasn't writing and writing was the Japanese subway attack and ... years ago\n... was also and if you want to talk more recently especially in the pop culture a major plot line in Breaking Bad any Mets fan knows about rice\nWell anybody who's interested in being a maniac will know about it I mean that's a it's not hard to find out uh uh about various compounds that can cause terror fortunately nobody appears to have been exposed but it's very dangerous stuff so they are going to leave no stone unturned trying to find whoever did that\nOr at least you know well we came in with a little ah Kanye

reason he decided to opine on the thirteenth amendment which of course was the amendment that abolish slavery and and and then thought that it needs to be revised not quite sure what that's about\n... if you dive deep into what you think he means about it there's something there about how they're still institutionalized you know with black people being a you know in correctional facilities and for some kind of slavery but the way he opined on it didn't make a whole\nLot of sense kind of like Trump sometimes but we had mentioned like sort of figure out what he's trying to sell it he says but what you mean right yeah\nIt's interactive yet a show the ... and of course we know that a a ... got a little presidential love because on Saturday Night live at the end of the show he put on his red

the\nBBC News alive and the local at ten o'clock I'm Rob Marine Corps just updating a story from Washington DC a mail processing Center for the Pentagon has detected possible rice and in a piece of mail the various poisonous substance made\nFrom castor bean just deadly and has been used in a number of fatal attacks overseas visuals apt to kind of gone through the piece of mail in question never made it into the area occupied by people working in the building will keep you updated on that story\nAnd of course the allegations are from way way back\nBut the question here with the time's up movement there's no clarity there's no standards are and the movement is valuable it's long overdue women should be heard but and and it's interesting I saw Donald Trump junior told detailing the daily mail that he's for fear for his sons\nYou says at an age when lives can be ruined or both sides of he said she said he fears more for sons than for his daughters I mean right now I say my son's father fought a ... should be careful got boys and girls and want to see what's going on right now it's scary\nUm and he's relating to the cabinet I'm saying but I get the movie she chasing\n... was really interesting for me because we're waiting to see when he was going to come back so he unexpectedly returned to stay Sunday night again at the comedy cellar\nAnd they put a new policy that they instituted to address patrons were uncomfortable with drop an ax um and this is about five weeks after his first unannounced or parents that set off a huge controversy\nI'm so he obviously is aiming for a comeback and feels it's time and it's okay or in the performance on Sunday he didn't address is appropriate inappropriate behavior\nIncluding instances in which he masturbate it in front of multiple women or he took the stage read some notes and ... notes that about twenty minutes of material there was wild applause however some were upset and some did\nWalk out one audience member visiting from Europe so the crowd was happy to see 'em but others said they were embarrassed and left and were not happy about it so the outcry also comes against the club with their disclaimer on the tickets it says swim at your own risk\nWith an icon of a swimming figure we never know who's going to pop in if an unannounced appearances not your cup of tea you're free to leave no questions asked your check on the house and the same language is posted a sign inside the club\nAn effort I guess so the customers are placate it who might be unhappy and yet let's people drop in and preserves that Huston comedy so it's been in place for about three weeks one a customer said it was so passive as if to say they had no say over who comes in meaning the club owner\nShould not put up a sign that says oh we may get a drop in they should have a policy and say no Louis Leakey is not welcome ... does the club owner determine when Louis CK comes back\nWhen not ... and how do you determine that if you look in the club owner so ... and others were even more upset about this so then you start thinking okay so Louis back\nHe he was a mentor to a lot of female stand up so he was blood for that I'm On the on the other hand what he did was heinous obviously but he kinda it kinda duck out for about four or five months you have enough money\nA year maybe write a column or say some things and then you start showing up again\nAnd maybe you've change maybe your change man maybe people feel like that was long long enough I guess he's testing the water\nBut here's the deal were in round two now of meat to where people are starting to have been accused are going to start wanting to come back to work wanting to have redemption and you go how equitable is that you got James Franco\nWho basically had no consequences um this was a guy who after paint the Golden Globes had a time's up ten you got former students from his studio acting school felt that they have to speak out about how he made them feel uncomfortable doing his classes in film shoots\nI'm In a fluid and removing plastic guards when simulating oral sex and flying into a rage when two of the women refused to do a topless saying well he's he's back he's on a show on HBO called the Deuce\nUh which looks at life in the Nineteen seventies that porn and prostitution suffer because they just renewed it for a second season meanwhile they drop the K and they remove lucky Louis from the service so\nThat's kind of a kind of interesting Bill O'Reilly is releasing a book again and promoting it and he's got his own channel and number this guy who had all these settlements who said hey I'm going to let you know I'm going to fight back against these settlements and you'll hear what the truth is never came through it the truth one of the settlements it's thirty two million dollars\nShould he be forgiven at this at this point in time and again how do you decide then you've got closer to home\nWhich is really fascinating to me is Jose squeeze our city council member um what happened is LA how the news site that they put up to report harassment and bias and what it did it received a complaint against\nCouncilman Jose ... are so her ... who is of course the president's city council instructed the personnel department\nTo have a special panel to look into complain of harassment discrimination retaliation remember this has happened before with we use our he said he was not aware of any details of complaint and therefore wouldn't comment on it\nUm and the the the complaint was made late in June and they're still I guess looking into it remember he he had a previous claiming twenty Thirteen a claim of sexual harassment filed by Francine ... his former\nDeputy chief of staff and she alleged that he had retaliated against her after she refused to provide him with sexual favors she also accused the counselor forcing her to transfer to a different job\nAnd pressuring her to quit Murray remember what happened there was\nHe said he engaged in central extramarital affair her pay jumped from forty seven thousand to one hundred and thirty two thousand dollars or seven years in his office\nUm she declined to be interviewed when they asked her about about the allegation but they settled they settled the harassment suit was it was settled privately by we use our five months before his reelection and twenty Fifteen\nAnd on this new one on this new allegations they're treating it like it doesn't if you don't hear about it is they're acting as if it doesn't exist and now the great thing is because he's turned out\nMisses he resigned may be running for his seat and we hear nothing about this this doesn't rise to even mention then we had another allegation today which is really strange\nA woman is re chanting her allegation of sexual harassment against deal Cisneros who was a Democrat running in thirty ninth congressional district name is Melissa phase is Ali who'd accusing notices narrows of making inappropriate comments to hurt a state party convention in February\nShe tweeted that she met with a candidate over the weekend and realize that have been a huge misunderstanding so she had been attacking them attacking them attacking the opponents have been using her\nIn their ads on and she said that she says narrows have suggested they go to a hotel room together\nAnd he later make comments that could have been interpreted as pay for play so this has been going on outside groups have been running as like I said they've been spent about a one point five million on the ads\nUm the statement raise questions over about ... about face from her because you make the allegations that he suggested we go back to her hotel room\nAnd the pay for play was there and by the way she said\nThat uh as recently as two weeks ago she called the advertisements accurate two weeks ago and um the reason that she did it was a campaign refused to take me seriously and this is the price they will pay\nLast week she emailed Cisneros opponents saying I Would rather have a Republican woman when than a creepy like guilt she said she sent the email out of frustration and now all of sudden she talked to him\nAnd she was drawing it so we see is that okay or is it politically motivated does it smell like political political motivation they talk to her interviewed her and she declined to elaborate on how original allegations could be chalked up to them as understanding she basically said when somebody doesn't communicate with you it makes you even angry and upset\nSo he's got all of this flying in the ether\nAbout ... again and it's really really important that women are heard because for so long women are hurt but there's this\nThis maybe over corrections and in the case of Kevin up to push back the ... and it's by the way it's really interesting when you look at the pushback in basically by age\nYou know for too long of course women um who brought Ford allegations of sexual assault were very fearful of retribution that they were going to be retaliated against and ... they were not hurt\nBut is there an over correction we're now and in his case Kavanaugh's case and again more information is coming out\nWe're again he's guilty improve until he's proven innocent so we're in a in a new normal for this\nUm and I don't know the society knows how to deal with this yet but I'm smelling that the second wave is happening were guys who are accused are going to come back like a face to uh and they want their life back it's like the walking dead and you've got more and more than that I can mention who are going to be coming back and and wanting jobs\nAnd like movie CK appears at a comedy club and his ruffling a lot of feathers people saying not not timing us and others in the clever laughing saying\nMan yeah oh it's okay it is time the ... the guy suffered enough I think one comedian actually said he kind of discounted it and said yeah it was kind of consensual and what he did was not that bad anyway so that's another part of this we're going to gauge\nThe allegation or your water down and said yeah not not that bad anyway so where does this go at this point who determines when when it's enough when the retribution when when we come back when you can ask forgiveness um should Louis seeking not be allowed to to\nPerform at the comedy club has it been too is is it too soon and how do you determine if it is too soon and if you want to take part in this conversation 'cause it's it's tough eight hundred to two to five to to do but all of this stuff has bubbling to the surface because of the cabinet allegations and by the way there is new information\nWith a carjacking in a crash a possible murder suspect led police on a high speed chase on Monday Night that started in the end of the north Hollywood with a brief excursion into Burbank during the pursuit the driver lettuce to passengers out of

I'm Sorry for what they did and that they will continue that behavior\nWell what are you doing this I hear that and I hear that and by the way your ideas maybe as good as anybody 'cause nobody has an idea yet on\nHow to how ... how to structure this but here's here's my question for you when I saw for instance that this was narrow situation that this woman came after him and made these accusations made these accusations made these accusations as as far as a week ago and then all of a sudden because there's an election came out and said you know what there was a misunderstanding\nUm how do you deal with that\nFinally I think she said oh that is it to this other state I'm then sexually assaulted\nAnd unfortunately Elias alter is as passed away but I always wanted him to apologize or at least that you know what I own it I I I did something wrong to you and I apologize for that\nYou can't take back the action but you can at least try to redeem yourself by taking responsibility for you\nAt now what about you but what about ... what about the different levels I mean there's the inappropriate comment where a person doesn't realize because there used to being in certain environment that they offended you and then there's of course groping and touching and then there's of course exposing there's all kinds of levels of this sexual assault and a front that\nThat that people are not getting the give and you never want to just be around that person anymore\nBut a lot of times you're assaulted by friends or\nCo workers or people you have to interact with again and when that that's a sad thing is on a lower level you can make a living thing you can get all else and you can at least make it look like that you are sincerely sorry and you know that there is an issue a problem that if\nWe can realize in many instances the the accused or at work or at school or wherever and colleges to um feels like they did nothing wrong says would would say to the woman I don't I don't in any way understand why you would be offended by that or how I found that you\nReally need\nTo get the therapy if they don't think that as you enter properly or exposing themselves to you or coming on to you so many times when you ask them if they don't see something is wrong there then there's something going on ... ...\nHow their response the\nBlame it on to the equal but yet they want to be handled at different way\nAnd in our society\nIf we want to be equal let's be equal if they don't want to be equal and they want special treatment and everything that they do they need to wake up\nWill so let me ask you a question that I I hear your anger just want I Want to put it out there 'cause I Want to have an honest conversation about it and I'm sensing there's a push back a big pushback\nFrom men at this point who were confused I'm don't understand what the punishment should be done to understand\nI'm an accusation like this from thirty six years ago but that said what should they have done to her and that hearing differently how should they have worked for differently this is a ... a woman who is ... and she seemed sincere about it who is now getting death threats and has to move it cetera how shall be tried it hurts you should be treated she's already suffice average\nEver I never heard anybody questionnaire on hey how many drinks did you have before you went to the party how come you can't remember where you where it was or how you got all how well I should\nThat choices that they were not they were not given the opportunity to question her and so a lot of a different manner they had that ... they had to take all of the all of those things off so law and to make sure that she didn't get rattled\nWell I think I think aid they could've after that and I said right after we went to go I call it the break like the half time\nThat the woman who was hired a lawyer who was hired to questioner could've cross examined her um and could have asked those questions and I guess they chose to to to dance around as gingerly because they didn't want to appear\nTo be harassing her afterwards he allegedly went through that said wait wait let me finish that said the senator already made up their mind that regardless of how she answered they were going to go ahead\nWith the vote 'em the mocking I think of the um the judge was in his presentation as being just so squeaky clean\nAnd yet allegation after allegation after allegation is that he didn't use a drinker a heavy drinker maybe a blackout drinker um and that he had a rage that was for a judge is going to be sitting on the court\nProbably not appropriate so that's I think we're the humor came from and by the way certain in life is not going to attack\nA victim of sexual assault they're just they're just not going to go there that's not what we're comedies made they're attacking the guy\nFor ... the the rage that he showed and when he said back to a senator about being blocked out he said back to the senator or or have you been have you ever had blackouts and as I said yesterday it my wife accusing me of an affair\nAnd I answered by what have you had an affair have you had affairs I don't think that's going to work out so well so the way he treated some of the questions yet and he's angry\nAnd they're going after his reputation so I understand that but where to place right now we're your anger and I'm Glad you called without your anger is it's out there it's out there and men are starting to get or push pushing back\nOn and saying oh hold on a second I'm I don't understand how this whole thing works and all of a sudden you're guilty until proven innocent started on college campuses after the uh\nThe story about the fraternity\nAnd the rape of a woman that turned out not to be accurate\nAnd and it continues today were the questions continue to grow and with Lucy cake coming back and performing how long should he be out and now with the president some both saying it's a

courts um\n[noise] that that could potentially grow or if this continues to escalate\nUm we in for about five hundred billion over five billion dollars worth of goods from China every year um and the president has you know very publicly threatening to cut tariffs on everything we import from China so that\nWould include a you know clothes and shoes and um [noise] you know retail items that you find in a discount stores and things like that [noise]\nUm so there is a threat that if this if this trade fight further escalates but there could be a chance that you got to we started\nSeeing some level of a crisis going up I'm In a lot of the\nStores um [noise] and you know with this NAFTA or I guess they're calling the U.S Mexico Canada even [noise] um [noise] you know this tightening of these um\n[noise] of the supply chains that will result on automobiles you know some economists and they in the car sector also sort of I'm looking at at that as well possibly that lead to an increase in price\nAnd we don't know we don't know how far out that is we don't know if that's three months away six months away a year away correct\nCorrect yeah I mean that you know I think you know it depends on the production cycle depends on the planning of companies and how they shift their supply chain that you know I'd sure everyone's doing what they can to mitigate any sort of a increases in crisis but you know when these when these rules are kind of changed you know that\nThat leads company sort of re assess\nYou know how they get to how that you know their\nSuppliers their supply chains and things like that which\nIs a lot there's a lot of movement that's where I said that it does a thousand pieces to read and there's a lot of ah onion to peel your\nDesign houses right doctors but I'm Talking Adam pursuit of using trade reporter a political I kind of wander around them I keep seeing the stock market go up every day and looking at just keep going up and up and open up so that value\nIs huge but as being a cynic\nUm I look at stuff and people said don't worry about the deficit so if you give a ton of money back to people through tax cuts that we we don't pay for it\nIt's going to provide some short term stimulus does that does that feel like it encourages further investment and the economy's gonna create like long term stimulus for growth or is this all a house of cards is is it is you know a mirage\n[noise] well I'm far from being economists say you know I Can't sort of a forecast macroeconomic ah trends and things like that you live but I I think that's generally the or was it the the intention of the\nTax or the tax cut a that was asked and you know a lot of that you know it was also at the corporate level too so I think the the intention was to get companies to reinvest and make capital investments and things like that um and you know I haven't seen any um [noise] you know\nPolls or or or analysis of sort of what the effect of that is but that's definitely I think what Congress said what are the administration was hoping to see their\nWill they do they have and they got they got they got to boost the terrorists\nUm bilateral trade surpluses don't guarantee that are you going to have prosperity and the same deficits don't seem to prevent rapid growth there is no hard war I that from from the economy's so but that's why I guess it's hard I just wanted to get your take on it and that you watch trade in Washington what is the person getting\nA lot of support from um is Congress department et cetera does everybody buying the Republicans all buying in in ... as far as more tired or they pushing back are they concerned\nWell I think the the Republican Party you know historically as the free trade party\n[noise] excuse me of the anti terrorist party has been sort of or worried about the direction this is going [noise] um in terms of you know the president's tariffs policies and there again some um attempts than Congress to sort of\nPush back against that nothing will successful really um you know Democrats are kind of conflict it I think they\nThey you know in many ways ideologically sort of agree with how the president views you've asked a other trade agreements um\nBut you know as as their political opponents ... they have to be sort of right after the skeptics of you know every anything he's doing that and you know there are a fair number of Democrats said are you know are not anti trade there they are uh you know trade you know trade friendly and so you know there's a lot of 'em\nI think in general the Democrats are looking you know trade has one of the navy shoe areas where they actually see some alignment with the president on policy\nAnd again you can't it's hard it's hard especially going into the midterms now to argue against the economy although although the administration there's so many other things going on that against stepped on but I thought it was an interesting accomplishment that he got it got it done was pretty huge and that it was it seems to be pretty well thought out it doesn't seem to be scattershot we'll know more\nDown the road to thank you Adam ... is a the trigger for a political and the website is political dark on the twitters at a\nAnd I should say it's B.
