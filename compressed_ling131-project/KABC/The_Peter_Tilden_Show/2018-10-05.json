Democrats the filibuster the cabinet nominee and that means that by Saturday the full Senate will be voting on Brett Kavanaugh get was Mitch McConnell yesterday announcing that he was going to file cloture on the floor of the Senate\nThere'll be plenty of town for members review and be briefed on the supplemental material before friday cloture vote so I'm falling cloture on judge Kavanaugh's nomination this evening so the process can move forward as I indicated earlier\nAnd the process should move forward the process should move forward because guess what shocker it turns out\nThat nothing has been found and we've been doing this for another week another week thank Senator Jeff flake\nAnd they are getting an FBI investigation was going to tell everyone they are clearly that's happening clearly Democrats are now very satisfied with how to go on everybody has a lot of faith in the FBI ...\nIt really feel like a full investigation has been done and they're feeling pretty satisfied battle to take for example Senator Dianne Feinstein who took the results of the FBI inquiry and she saw that basically said nothing new and actually you know what I feel like it's been settled I guess now really consider Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr alternatively she did what everyone knew what she would do and she said\nOh no investigation is a bunch of going and it was never meant to be comprehensive and therefore Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh on that and here is Dianne Feinstein really has just then\nI mean there's no other word for it in terms of the profits that she's in gauge than than evil I mean it really has been an evil process in which means engaged getting an allegation July thirtieth holding it for six weeks until just before the vote releasing it without any corroborating detail\nMay be releasing it anonymously in order to spur the full release of the story and then really right cabinet and supposedly ...\nRight now all of us just been gross but here Senator Dianne Feinstein continuing her pattern of being ... by saying that the FBI investigation is incomplete and because in complete therefore that's really why we shouldn't vote on Kavanaugh\nSo what I can say is the most notable part of this report is what she's not in it\nAs we noted by the White House the iffy I did not interview friend Kevin we have seen even more pressure forward should witnesses who wanted to speak with the sci fi but we're not interview [laughter]\nOkay so I Love that she says what's most important here is what's not in it\nThat is true but not how she means it so she says what's most important as all the people you have to I didn't interview\nWell that's because the people that she's talking about could provide no corroborating evidence was not in the report is that there is no corroborating evidence for and any of Christine Blasey Ford's allegation\nNo corroborating evidence none\n... piece on the judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley he says there is no hint of misconduct and confidential FBI report on Kavanaugh sexual misconduct claims he says there's nothing in it that we didn't already know Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski Italy Susan Collins from from Maine she suggested that the FBI process has made her feel a little more\nQuiet about this whole thing maybe that's what Jeff Flake was going for it so well the best possible spin on it\nMaybe one Senator Flake called for the FBI investigation he was just trying to get Susan Collins on board or provide cover for a couple of Democrats like Joe mansion and Heidi Heitkamp to vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nAlso the polling data week has been brutal for Democrats and that means that Joe mansion and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota that the two of them may in fact both for cabinet adjust to preserve their Senate seat\nIs very likely right now the Democrats than their chances before the Kavanaugh thing we're not good\nAt it with regard to taking back the tentative about one in ...

go go we've got to get this in the books All right we've got to have a decision now why because\nIf we wait until after November than the red state Democrats don't have to worry about paying the price of the polls and if we can get into January the Democrats control the Senate so good luck President Trump nominating anybody\nTo the Supreme Court that the Republicans would want an ... so that's that's the bottom line with the Republicans it's go go go with the Democrats it's slow slow slow and so the problem is they're not into the issue of fairness or due process or truth\nLet's face it the Democrats are mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore about Merrick Garland\nMerrick Garland was put up as a kind of a moderate slightly left of center nominee for the Supreme Court by President Obama with the better part of the year left in Obama's last full year and the Republicans who control the Senate said no no we don't think we're going to uphold our constitutional obligation to advise and consent\nWe're just not going to hold a hearing\nSo the Democrats were really chapter about that so much so that after they had sort of the the the practice session with Neil Gorsuch since he was replacing Scully it wasn't going to change any votes but when you\nMove to the new justice cabinet replacing Anthony Kennedy the swing vote the holder of same sex marriage and a lot of progressive values than it's time to fight okay\nSo bottom line is the Republicans wanted to go past the Democrats wanted to go slowly so\nWhat do you think the real the real proper appropriate approach to to this whole Kavanaugh things should be I think there are some guidelines that we could take a look at it would sort of really help us toward this goal of fairness and due process\nHere's one guideline for ya assault sexual assault is serious it is not a joke\nIs not boys will be boys\nIt is a crime and can have longstanding affects Harvey Weinstein scene and a and a lot of these other guys Cosby they belong in prison Cosby's on his way harbor you still got to face the music so that's topic one salt is serious\nNumber too often there are no witnesses and cooperation is kind of hard because harassment is inherently private in almost all circumstances\nThird point it's often unreported because of shame because of retribution because the threats because it's expensive\nFourth point the me too movement has done a tremendous service by encouraging reports and punishing offenders and deterring assaults so these are some realities good news for the me too movement\nSome bad news for the me too movement the next point I'd make is not every allegation is true\nAnd the consequences of on true allegations are devastating and how about the fact that it is not essential to seek can obtain corroboration the allegation may be true and may be proven without it but it's certainly reasonable to seek corroboration\nAnd there are a whole bunch of times of cooperation how 'bout witnesses about oral contemporaneous statements when somebody comes out of a room crying and screaming and talk to people\nHow 'bout documents written statements around the time that I Am a circumstantial evidence how about character evidence as to whether if somebody has a pattern of doing this kind of thing intent Bill Cosby\nSo you don't have to have her operation to conclude that somebody did it but it isn't it a good job isn't it a good idea to try to get\nSometimes it's reasonable\nTo believe without cooperation if the credibility battle tips to the accuser but sometimes it's not look at motives political motives are they lying\nThe bottom line is that the siders the decider should be unbiased\nYou do not want the mom of the accused deciding whether he is guilty you do not want the dad of the accuser deciding whether she was in fact the victim\nYou don't want the party trying to achieve some political objective you don't want to party desperate to save abortion rights and same sex marriage and and Obamacare you want totally neutral prosecutors and judges and jurors\nYou don't have that situation you say well then change the dam system get people involved who will be objective\nWhat's your take on all this one eight hundred to two two\nK. A. B. C. royal oaks in for Peter told them let's go to the phones let's go to John in Northridge Joe welcome to KBC\n\nA John you're on the air there we go can you hear me this I can hear you this hour has her wedding far away\nNot on so I Would have to vote against it as a confirmation or not because I think it would be a bad justice but um I and I agree with everything he came out against one in his opening statements alley railed against the Senate and his treatment by Senate he\nDid rail I think Matt Damon rail even better though oh yeah did you see him on Saturday Night live didn't see how you got to check it out on you to be starts out and he says I'm going to start and an eleven I'm going to go to a Fifteen real quick and it was a perfect take on Capitol All right so what's your bottom why why would you vote against him that\nWell even though I agree with everything he said it was the forum at which he said it and the languages which was particularly partisan and it it it is\nEven though it wasn't the attack on him particularly partisan oh I'm Dianne Feinstein Z holding on for the letter for weeks or months wasn't that partisan\nAbsolutely and I don't disagree with that and is editor at a congressman they're going to be partisan that's not a judge\nHere but he's a human being do you see his op ed piece in the wall Street Journal this morning Oh absolutely\nI I I understand completely\nYeah I mean he said I I did I was too emotional but I was there was a dad I was there was a son I was there as a father I mean he's been accused of gang rape sexual assault his entire reputation this is his epitaph that is being drafted he ... he has this emotional need\nTo to actually you know project himself into the debate and you know what I think happened John is that he was on a a mark in my column on Fox News and\nHe was so low key and it was laid back and I think people living room and they they said brat\nYou gotta really come on strong in that hearing 'cause it wasn't enough what you send them a column ... people only you're going to believe you if you show some some true fury at the the outrageous unfair nature of these allegations so yeah I think he might over the top but I think good he just felt he had two projectors emotion\nOh I completely agree with everything you just said a but when you come down to the bottom line is confirmation has got to make twenty to thirty percent of our population apoplectic and it\nAlready happened they were apoplectic from the day Trump was it was a he want do you remember the video of the people gnashing of teeth of the renting them garments that the the the clinical major depression that one quarter of the nation needed to be institutionalized\nOh I completely understand and I agree with that but there there's a solution to that in four years more people go to the election and get rid of the president where we are talking about a lifetime appointment and\nThat the court's decisions if it's enough of the population don't agree with them and decide not to follow them I think he got a problem\nYou know I I hear you John and I think you're right it is a lifetime of port appointment could not be more important uh but yeah you know it's ... it's also important not to try somebody's reputation all ... and let him led him to fend him so he got we've got a bunch of other callers want away in a thank you for calling though\nA let's move to Nick and west hills that you're on Cape Cod royal oaks in for bitter children are you doing\nGreat how about you royal bags\nWonderful I Believe a in a yes vote um I also see that this is about ... the way\nAnd if roe v Wade was overturned it would be states would decide each state would decide ah to either get rid of abortion and we have to remember abortions stops a beating heart\nWell you know what next some people are worried that it would go beyond that some people are worried that if they're really pro life folks take over it isn't just oh well there's no word privacy in the constitution therefore we're going to let the states decide it's up to them\nSome people say that the pro life folks could get in there and say guess what a fetus is a human being it's murder if you were born and therefore the states don't have a choice\nThey're worried that abortion will actually be illegal now I frankly and no idea whether if Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh and maybe the third Trump ... got together if that would have I have a feeling the chief justice Roberts is going to stand firm and say look\nPrecedent means something we're not going to overturn roe versus Wade but I think that's what people are worried about\nAll I think the the it should be pro choice I think the baby should choose let the baby grow up to be about seven

all out eleven o'clock I'm Rob ... Senator Jeff flake says he will vote yes\nTo confirmed judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court correspondent Linda ... Kenyatta has details\nAnd it turned out he was about as progressive as anybody on the court in recent history and that's because with a lifetime appointment he didn't have to answer to any political master in some here were very unhappy with that but but it but it's ironic because now we're getting the cabinet situation and everything's drenched in politics even though it's supposed to be above the fray\nEverywhere except in the ... the rule I think and also that they say the earlier that country that appoints lifetime judges and the Supreme Court Iran's so that\nSo that's a bad design okay I get tank you parks for your thoughts are let's go to Brian in West Hollywood you're on KBC with oil and for Peter how are you doing Brian\nYes thanks for taking my call for\nI have listened to various times you certainly make your point's very valid and very effective thank you and I want to say this I agree the appointment was good confirmation should be forthcoming shortly and that should be a yes also I was\nLooking at Canada's requirements and they have two items that are ...\nIt is different than here and number one is the appointment to the Canadian Supreme Court does not require any confirmation therefore it doesn't create any political animosity\nAnd number two the justice in the Supreme Court if Canada must vacate their position at eight Seventy five in other words they cannot stay at that post any longer at a beyond the age of Seventy five right\nIn the United states it's different it's a lifetime appointment I think it's easier to adopt or at least consider eight Seventy five because it gives any company a justice is a chance to be elevated to the Supreme Court so I think there's an advantage to do that you\nRaise some interesting points I guess on the no confirmation up in Canada and while that might give the president a little bit too much power if you don't have the the Senate's ability to to say yeah we think that was a good idea as for the age you know we've had some folks get up there I don't think we've had too many you know dementia daughter injustices that it was created a problem I\nMean Canada they're great for like ... and maple syrup I don't know that we should be emulating their system\nI think the genius of the American system is the checkerboard of checks and balances I mean\nThe house can't do anything without the Senate right the the president can veto it we can impeach the president we can compete Supreme Court members if we get stupid in passing unconstitutional the Supreme Court can knock it out is unconstitutional it's this this brilliant genius\nSystem that the founders came up within the Seventeen hundreds that has actually served us so well we are the breakthrough shining example of liberal democracy in in all of human history and I think a lot of it is because\nThis system stops the tyranny either by the majority\nOf folks rising up and ... and just destroying folks or by the minority where you have a monarch and so on so I think it'd be tough to tinker with our system\nNo but the one thing that I was concerned with disappointment was completely political and this created created a lot of diversity and at least devices\nName name a Supreme Court nominee who hasn't been pretty political asked recipe sexual years right\nI Want to ask you this what do you think is being lost if we don't require confirmation other words what are we losing by not requiring\nWhen you're talking about the president nominates somebody and he's automatically in any where ... where in other words\nWell then you've got a president I mean a lot of people don't like Donald Trump you're going to have you on a Donald Trump nominee with absolutely no oversight\nNo but let me ask you what is Canada losing by not doing this when their prime minister appoint somebody what state they were parliamentary system fright but they don't require this so therefore there's no political animosity when they point the incoming justice to the Canadian Supreme Court\nIn other words they don't they don't go to any controversial issues\nNow no you're right they avoid a lot of controversy and and things are probably calmer up there again I guess I Would just vote for the idea of the idea of a say having having some sort of oversight some sort of check and balance it let's go to Donny and Los Angeles you're on KBC was roiling for Peter how are you Donnie\nHey well ... thanks for taking a lesson I now live alone don't watch it but my question is why a lot of that came out of ... got well\nI don't think people are ignoring it has been kind of a big news story um I guess some people he's in he's in it was not easy is probably like Ninety five years old\nOr another a rather up their justice who's still on the Supreme Court has made her opinion clear about Trump I don't know that she's waited on Kavanaugh but so yeah I mean whether they're former or current justices Donny\nOr some people are are not shy about expressing their opinions\nSo you don't let it in a city justice while those on the other guy\nAnd he's he's a political animal to he he was appointed by a politician and he had his definite views he would vote with his his liberal block on the Supreme Court I just like Ruth Bader Ginsburg I mean that to me the idea of of\nHarping on the fact\nThat catalog kinda lost it and got emotional
