knowledge\nThe knowledge that empowers you to control your financial future\n\nAnd um you can do some really good forward planning and one of the things you might want to do is take advantage of some of those tax privileged accounts that are out there\nAre lots of opportunities out there you have the opportunity to put money aside in your um your IRA program whether it be the traditional i._r._a. or the Roth IRA\nThat's five thousand five hundred dollars for those under the age of fifty\nAnd six thousand five hundred dollars for those age fifty or more even if you have a non working spouse you can open an eye on race for the non working spouse as long as it's funded by your writings and has to be covered by earned income earned income\nSo that's another opportunity to put money aside you can make a fully deductibles traditional i._r._a. contribution to qualify\nAnd um\nThat's another way to get money working for the future now that way you get it the Dutch and\nYou get a fully deductible contribution to a tradition liar way of qualified but you can also do a Roth IRA rape you prefer if you qualify for that program the amounts are the same fifty five hundred for those under fifty sixty five hundred for fifty plus\nAnd there are income\nThresholds for Roth IRA eligibility\nAnd these are all terrific ways outstanding ways for you to put money away for the future whether it'd be in the traditional higher rate the Roth IRA ... the most important thing of all is that you take advantage to the max that you can afford\nAnd the other most important thing of all is to absolutely take advantage and an an a minimal\nTake advantage of the full matching provision if you have a matching prevention is so many companies two and a four O. one K. some for three days this is the definition of free money if anybody ever asked you what is there such a thing is free money the answer is yes\nAnd free money is represented by the matching contribution that your company will give you\nYou know four O. one K. or similar type plant because if you meet the minimum standard let's say they say well we'll give you three percent if you put in six will match half of your contribution up to six percent so you put insects they add three\nNine goes in nine percent goes in of your salary and yes that three percent the company is throwing in there that is the definition of free money that is like a raise that the company\nOffering you but you have to be smart enough to take it by at least reaching the minimal\nContribution standard that you would have to make but that's a great way for you to put money aside as well this is a great\nTime for you to maximize your charitable giving uh my favorite charity is the U.S funds for UNICEF which does great work for children around the world\nI Would also point out that there is a terrific provision in the tax law which is now a permanent law\nThat you can give to your favorite charities directly from your IRA this has to be done directly from your custodian to the charity or or charities of your choice\nSo you don't handle the money you direct your custodian to make the gift or gifts now in the case of an individual you're allowed to give up to one hundred thousand dollars a year\nYour favorite charities directly from your ... to the charities from your IRA and if you do that as part of your required minimum distribution\nYou don't have to pay income tax on that money up to a hundred thousand and some of you I Know one person has an IRA and the spouse has an area where you can both do it\nUp to a hundred thousand each on an annual basis your favorite charities instruct your custodian\nTo make those gifts you may have been planning to make them any way to get cash give are indeed money because you're not going to have to pay income tax on this money\nThat had to come out of the IRA anyway as part if you had it as part of a required minimum distribution so there's no reason to pay more than you have to pay\nThis especially true since if your ducking charitable contributions you know if you're a high earner\nThat they do take away your deductions as your income increases those have you

psalm on he told Fox News he wants to trip she's family to know the perpetrators will be held responsible\nYou know under her direction she supported the communist party's a mayday supplement and relating to LA county federation of labor which he the leader in um for the long time since back to the Nineteen twenties thirty\nDid not allow people who were a registered communist joined the labor party a but in twenty Seventeen they amended their constitutions by law to allow communist and my opponent married arousal was a big proponent of that she was a big factor in getting that\nBut I think she's a communist I'm not joking\nBut I Will say that um she is a labor leader and look I'm a union member as you know said I'm a writer of two unions and my wife is a member of to union so\nI Know that from my own experience um\nThat a union workplace is the best workplace I strongly believe that there's no daylight between my opponent and me in terms of our support for labor however um she's only about protecting union jobs that's her\nOne no campaign all about protecting union jobs whether a Chevron oil union jobs prison guard union jobs polluter company union jobs protecting union jobs I'm running I'm the president of a regional chamber of commerce I was also the head of the ... chamber of commerce or during a time when it became a hip is neighbor not America and\nForbes magazine said that um I'm running to represent everyone else who works for a living everyone that small business owners mom and pop restaurants professionals artists and writers and the many who are working two or three jobs riding lifted Newberg renting an air being be coddling together an income from two or three jobs\nThese are not union jobs these are people who would benefit from a single payer health care for every Californian\nThese are people who would benefit from a Ford Abul housing\nAnd so this is why I'm running a to push that agenda forward because the Democratic party if not pushing that agenda forward as exemplified by their support for my opponent\nWow okay that everybody get that as ours\nIf you did anything you could go through WWW dot choice for state Senate dot com and find out all my years just because my positions are all their versus my opponent who has no information on our website just so everyone knows Brandon ... is a union member as well [laughter]\nI Am franchise with a union but I'm not a union member and you bought your work with many union made a lot of course I Am I right out of that yeah so so let me ask you Brandon I'm\nRunning for city council obviously is different than running for state Senate now you and told me just before we went on the year there's at least five candidates running but you're the only Republican\nAs of right now I think I'm the only Republican that has announced to run for that office there's going to be a lot of candidates running for the city council position for a number of reasons one um city council is probably\nFor these career politicians a great stepping stone I heard um a dream as Erin who's an assembly candidate really wants to go to the city council next and that you know you kind of think like he's up in the legislature in Sacramento why would he want to take a step down to go to the city council today to counsel is a very powerful\nUm position in Los Angeles and many of the problems in Los Angeles\nIn the San Fernando valley have started in the city council I mean are are homeless situation\nIs probably when I've been to many town homes I went to um many or a public forums and the number one issues in the San Fernando valley and in um CD district twelve\nIs a homeless shelter issue it's the um\nProposition ten is is what prompted the rent controlled rent controlled right the reason why I brought that up is that\nUm and and and I'm I'm more of an independent impartial let me just put that out there um but rent control\nThe government telling a landlord what they cannot charge and what they can charge and\nWouldn't the answer would be to just put up more housing yeah so in ... let me ask you\nPeter ... your your for rent your your for rent control\nLet me say this first of all I'll thank you for bringing up the homeless issue when I talk to people out there I bet last eleven months I've been out on the campaign trail talking to everyday people who work for a living and their two concerns\nThe big concern is the state of health care or one illness and they could lose everything they have they're concerned about that the rising cost of premiums the conflict between a different plants in ... we know this right\nUm that's one of the second one is an immediate concern about the homeless crisis we see in front of us first thing I Will say by the way as\nIf you're concerned and unhappy with the situation of our homeless brothers and sisters living on the street slipping sleeping on the street\nThen look at a who's been in charge and look at all the people that my opponent helped get elected\nOr they're the ones that didn't address is five years ago ten years ago Fifteen Years ago so no longer a homeless issue and it's no longer a homeless problem now with the homeless crisis uh when it comes to the homeless it's been a primary focus of my community active about the past few years\nWorking with Monday Night mission shower of hope recycled resources or the new coalition for the homeless we have a fundraiser a laughs on tap comedians\nAre doing comedy to raise money to buy to fund a mobile shower units which brings ... hours to our\nLike I had homeless vets just on the street I slept in a tent on the sidewalk in front of city hall to call them the mayor to house homeless women who are most at risk for sexual assault and rape every night well good for you and homeless shelters themselves were never built for\nYou know a coed facility there were built for homeless man so they're really not designed\nFor women and children um\nBut when it comes to the homeless issue my number one focus is affordable housing the reason many people are homeless because they can't afford rent and once you move once you're priced out of your apartment I'm In you sleep in your car it's very difficult to go from your car back into an apartment\nGenerally you go from your car to a shelter to the street and the key to addressing the homeless crisis is to build affordable housing it's not about temporary shelters that's a temporary solution shelter temporary shelters don't cure homeless as housing\nCurious almost as to how do we build affordable housing where do we get the money to do that here's the thing the reason we are not building affordable housing is because politicians in the pocket of developers to donate thousands of dollars to their campaigns\nAnd so they do ... says I'll let them build big condos with three or four affordable units which means these are apartments that will cost of two thousand five hundred three thousand it's not what a working family can really afford so of course developers who put their money into a construction project they want to get bang for their buck they want to get a profit mhm I understand that\nI'm not a communist I understand that\nBut where do we get the money that that's my thing my thing has always been solved the problem where do we get the money here's my solution thank you for asking that said and I'm\nWorking as I Do have to present a regional chamber of commerce I've been to China a few times I've been there to address investors for projects here in the states the\nEU America has a program a visa program to ... five investor program that means that if you're in China or England or Vietnam and you wanna get a green card visa to come live in the states if you invest half a million or a million dollars in a ... job creating project usually construction\nThen your visa application goes to the front of the line\nFor a lot of these rising middle class Chinese billionaires who are rich off all the stuff that you and I buy at Walmart and Costco\nYou know what they want if they can only have one child so they want to have more kids and once you have money they want to come to the states and they want kids have American education some my proposal if the state of California should encourage investment in affordable housing developments\nThe investor the foreign investor gets their green card visa to the front of the lines are expensive and we get a visa and we get 'em affordable housing but if you get ... if you get thirty investor you got Fifteen million dollars to build that\nWatch a guarantee that they're going to do this not do the same thing put the money up and and build condos or whatever that are two three million apiece\nWell that's where that's why I'm running the state Senate and California government need to ensure that we have this program and encourage investors from foreign countries if you invest a lot of times they investor half million a million dollars in a construction project and it doesn't happen and they wasted two years waiting time\nHaving the state of California guarantee or insure and say look we're going to make sure that this affordable housing apartment building goes up\nIt's a win win the foreign investor gets to move their family here to front of the visa card line using an approved you know you'd be five investor program\nAnd we meaning Angelenos get affordable housing\nSo if they went to a really great immigration attorney\nThey gave them let's say a couple of hundred thousand dollars don't you think they could get the same result\n[laughter] no I don't know ... unless you can show me a case where that happened looked certainly people go through brokers tried to figure it out but if you have that money many people do invest that money and surely do to make a profit know to get the visa don't the green card I 'cause I already I out money\nHope that's the case because we need more housing obviously a take a look in any place you go to we need more we need more apartments and they agree with Peter on it\nNews update Pomona fully say a ten year old boy was

I think the big picture and the reason I I feel that you want to vote yes on prop ten\nOr repeal Costa Hawkins out what it is is it's about local control right now rent control is controlled across

that's going to be looming is the battle over public employee pension and retirement funds\nAnd its unfunded and and what the democratic establishment is not telling you is it the reason they keep

Ajay on seven Ninety ABC some money starts falling from the sky and nine which Doug ... with doctors drew in Lawrence Yvonne end story with Jillian and John\nLos Angeles Orange County cumulus station [noise] ABC\nNews live and the local at ten o'clock on rubber into two people found in an open desert area in San Bernardino county around but identified as a missing a Palmdale couple\nAuthorities say eighty seven year old Keith Davis was found dead Saturday Night Dennis Ninety One year old wife Pauline was found alive in the city of Aleppo and taken to a hospital for treatment her condition was not immediately available\nAnd I want to upgrade the property owners spend some money now to upgrade the property or all of a sudden if I go to upgrade the property had our recoup costs if I'm limited by five percent cap or if I got a rent controlled bored by weight and if you have a wreck control board\nThat goes for the uh the attendance rather than the owners okay then you just put in all of these upgrades in your place\nAnd you can charge from why ... why would I Do that and why would I spent fifty grand upgrade or a hundred grand to make it nicer if I Can't get back my investment 'cause I Can't raise the rent so that's the problem mom and pop owners a lot of those guys and then the um the builders\nThey're not going to start building developers not going to build if they have the upside\nOf potential limited so that's my two cents on this it's it's pretty interesting to see a it's also failing right now it looks like people are aware that prop ten doesn't make a whole lot of sense that it can actually do the opposite and it will hurt renters instead of do rent control it will make\nLess units available in the last year and it's available what happens more demand\nMore cost so construction costs of also going up\nWhich puts deals on hold because it takes the margins away so anything that they take somebody's investment and puts a cap on it not so sure here's something else however that you should be aware of the Los Angeles city\nWhat is going to consider approving ready for this a thousand percent increase in street damage restoration feet so this is the the the companies are utilities pay when they got to cut into a street in order to fix it or build new infrastructure like Internet cables or gas lines or what about\nA thousand percent increase also makes it more expensive to build housing and we say we need more housing that doesn't matter they're gonna they're gonna charge more because of the city can yield more um when they do that and I guess what happens you know who pays that the\nThe D. W. P. you know um who pays that the U.S because they'll re sell raise the rates from the D. W. P. and this is another way to get a backdoor tax um they're going to get hit the hardest or the DWI the rate payers they say they're going to protect it to pay another thirty seven million per year for infrastructure improvements\nOver what we've been paying now and guess what Los Angeles cannot guarantee that all the money will be used for re paving\nSo they're going to yield more money and I have a feeling this smells like you know how\nThe D. W. P. gives money to the general fund each year and they had to give less last year\nA it was curtailed because of the lawsuit so they had to give less this is the way for them to make up the money that the mayor's plan calls for the city to collect Seventy million dollars in St damage restoration freeze up from eight million over the current year for eight million to Seventy million\nAbout thirty million of that will be spent to repair the worst roads with additional money going to maintain streets that are still in decent conditions so the D. W. P.\nWho's board is what Meryl ... there's no public objections to the proposal\nAnd it looks like the increase is a revenue grab it and you can bet it's going to cost us in higher DWI so I thought you should know that because not getting a lot of attention but during and sounds like it's not us oh it's over there I get it so people will cut into the streets\nOr to upgrade them because they gotta they gotta put in lines and stuff yeah they got to pay to put it back so what's it it's a thousand percent increase yeah it's going to end up\nHitting you and I think they vote on it tomorrow and have you heard much about it now so it's another way to take money out of your pocket um and and this one you may not even be aware of so be aware of it or the LA city council proposing another fee\nThat is probably going to make housing even more expensive and we don't forget we got the twenty twenty Olympics coming folks we got to clean up all of these problems before all these visitors come to our country here to see the Olympic Games in twenty twenty eight which just cracks me up I don't know how they can do any of that stuff so\nThere you go stuff's going to end up costing you more material costs land labor costs city fees have already risen so much\nYou got tired of somewhat from Canada steal from China at construction and now what they're going to do is add more cost and make it harder to build and more regulations in or out a thousand bucks so thank you very much for that that's good to know and then the one other related article which I Love and maybe you can help me with this\nBecause look firefighters work their butts off\nUm and they've had a bad fire seasons with all the fires that we had and they also not just fight fires here we ... we loaned them out to other communities from need the help but the report that came out over the weekend that LA county firefighters are in massive overtime pay I'd love to hear from a fire fighter\nBecause it looks like they're being investigated now to see if the payroll is actually being administered correctly because they said it's a billion dollar payroll and the times had their own analysis of the payroll which was salaries overtime and friendship fringe benefits for about a hundred thousand employees\nMore than six hundred and forty fire department workers received at least a hundred grand in overtime\nIn twenty seven twenty Seventeen fire department and was about a third of the counties one thousand highest paying employees you got you got stories in here where are the highest highest was signed chief Tom re who worked in the fire prevention services bureau here on the base salary of a hundred and Seventy five grand\nWhich is consistent with his rank\nWas paid an additional two hundred and eighty three thousand dollars in overtime bringing us total compensation to four hundred and eighty thousand bucks another one captain Sergio ... who received about three hundred twenty two thousand and extra pay\nOn top of the hundred twenty six thousand base salary pushing his compensation to four hundred and fifty seven thousand dollars he work he worked in twenty Seventeen Seventy four hundred and forty nine hours the equivalent of six twenty four hour shifts a week all year and he works at a station in Compton my question to you is\nThat they need to do this much overtime or the or is the system is a system a mess and firefighters who put in for this over time is over time still mostly you're sleeping at the station you're playing billiards making sandwiches you know what I mean but you're on call there\nBut if you if you have a bad home life or you don't have to see your family that much you don't want to see your family that much\nYou say yeah I'll stay there and I'll do overtime and I'll do double shifts 'cause they'll shift all of a sudden you're I think it's time and a half is what you're making\nSo if if they get sick or take time off which is common also colleagues villains spots and that's called recall but these top earners these guys are making a lot of money they average over time as a fortune anyway um so I wondered\nIf this is something that's required or is this mismanagement that the another caps on overtime shifts\nSo they prevent firefighters from working more than five of their long shifts consecutively there's also safety in a fatigue factor here and the reducing the quality of service to the public so about one in five dollars spent roughly one billion payroll they're saying went to overtime pay about one\nOne in five which is a billion dollars department exceeded as overtime budget\nAbout a hundred and sixty million by about forty six million dollars um this is money that could be spent on other programs so I don't get I don't understand why it's structured that the guy is making a buck forty or buck Seventy in his job as a firefighter can make two or three times that much\nUh working overtime and I need you to help me with this because again I didn't do the investigative report and they know firefighting is a tough thing and you need 'em but again part of this is when you're in hundred thousand dollars over time or two hundred thousand hours of overtime\nIs hanging out at the station house nice I'm sure in some communities the station houses are busier than others but that said\nDon't know how often an average station is called to do their duty to go out and rescue to go out and put out fires to go out and save somebody but it it appears ... and again we've had an extreme weather in recent years which is another driver of costs of the county\nBut is this is this something that can't be corrected and is it abused or if you're a firefighter live love to hear from you\nAnd hear you say no no no no this is a necessary it's always going to be this because the average firefighter has to work third shift to cover others um I Know that there was a big push in the eighties with firefighters\nAnd that a lot of those are retiring now and I know there was also a downturn in the economy so they didn't do as much hiring on the other hand I also read all of those stories and heard all about how\nHard it is to get a firefighting job because their golden and that a lot of them were taken at one time by sons of and family members because you get the inside of when when they're going to hire\nAnd how to pass the test that cetera so there was a bit of that going on and then with the drop program we heard and they got us in ten and say you know what you don't need a drop program for firefighters they make enough and there's enough incentive to get him so if there's enough incentive\nWhy do we not have enough firefighters that we have to pay these guys to do such enormous overtime that it it's a billion a billion dollars extra\nFor firefighters to fill in the workload so if you want to participate in that conversation be great and I'd love to hear especially if there's some firefighters in the audience because again Mm my sense of it is you're on payroll while you're doing that shift and a lot of it could be in a lot of these states announces\nHanging out there playing cards talking others maintaining the the the equipment etc but again when you're looking at the average is Ninety cents out in overtime to a hundred thousand something's going on there and I know that the times his own investigation they're saying now they're doing their own investigation\nOvertime costs at the Los Angeles fire departments served thirty six percent in the last five years so these are some of the highest compensated workers in local government and some of them are making like I said four hundred thousand five hundred thousand so your take on that\nThirty six percent of the last five years placing some firefighters among the highest compensated workers a local government and that's according to report published this morning in the LA Times or report the increase comes\nAs a department grapples with staffing shortages and several seasons of extreme of wildfires yet some county officials and outside experts question whether fire commanders or properly managing their

heard the recording of the tape 'em so that's a new piece of information uh what else was there a yet they won't release the video apparently because\nThey don't want folks to know how they bug the

trying to somewhat protect\nThe Saudis and that's because of our entanglements with them um and how they help us with Iran on our per purchases et cetera it's going to be a tough it's going to be a

they're going to go for it if it's there and it's legal to do it was more about management and how it is a management scale not even\nNot even management it's the city or the county the city leaders are county leaders allow they're the ones who who do the hiring not the fire department why don't get on the train\nIt it it's interesting because they're going to get a good point but they were doing an investigation right now to find out why there's so much overtime where there's so much rampant overtime and why the normal scheduling rules couldn't applied and again the firefighter these guys work their buns off\nI get it but on the other hand if I can make two hundred thousand dollars in a victory over time and a good part of it is sleeping they're staying there hanging out there um why

he hundred percent believes let me just sit there in miles were very strong the other thing is that person's getting intel remembered supposedly is getting some of the best and tell from not just us his own intel agencies but from Europe\nA turkey who you've got a question than gr wink wink nod nod I mean 'cause turkey has an agenda here nevertheless senior you just heard that tape and as as this is starting to play out um this story is changing and morphing\nAnd again it smells really badly to everybody concern because the story story went from nothing happened\nTo ... a fistfight a and about

more thoughtful and and fully literate\nEngage in that same kind of relationship with what the writer come out that would have called in Saudi Arabia the ISIS that made it I'm a kind of a kind of ...

think and again this thing is the story won't go away it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and it's sometimes more than ... when you put one person's face to it\nThen when you put mass killings et cetera but this is not going to go away you dealt with Silicon Valley for a long time who in Silicon valley will be the first to say gun we're giving the money back\nI don't know and I I I you know I call on everybody in Silicon valley to give that money back here's the reality\nSilicon Valley in many cases the technology they use from GPS to touch screens to other things was actually funded through government grants and government run program ZZ I'm\nThey deny that history and then build these companies with huge valuations pretending that they built it all themselves they're cutting the American working class and middle class\nIn many cases they abusing their online market power if you look at Google and Facebook and building monopolies that allow our democracy itself to be compromised and so our goodwill is stretching than there is a tech backlash underway as you know you know which is sometimes called the ... and\nIt feels to me like the revelation that you know the biggest swing checkbook in Silicon valley has become the Saudis is sort of like the final nail in the coffin of the fantasy that these people are here to change the world they are just companies like any other companies and not you know evil they're just\nRegular companies and for a long time they've gotten this special exemption from the kind of scrutiny that we've visited upon banks and chemical companies and car seat manufacturers\nWe don't regulate them properly we don't tax them properly because we all sort of bought into this fantasy that they were here to make the world a better place so whether or not they returned them money Peter it is up to us\nTo start treating Silicon Valley just like normal companies and start making sure that we are properly regulated them for the public good
