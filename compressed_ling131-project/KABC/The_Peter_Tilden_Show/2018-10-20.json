I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the word I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we really don't know if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying\nYou know a while ago they are you know I'm ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a ... ... about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winner ran

one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances\nAnd we ended up kind of painting

now back to the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humid Larry Jacobs and director of restructure development happens structure it online trading ketamine shed some light on could be in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income\nWhether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets\nBut when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities degenerate into give generate more income and especially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined and so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crash there's a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a\nA a not so that they are looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money you know a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income\nBut a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our incoming our retirement accounts or and if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction\nWhere where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why it's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that\nThe woman lives in Russia and it's unlikely that she would be extradited to the U.S regulators with the state bureau

[noise]\nYou're listening to how we're trading Radio Welcome back if you're just tuning in us Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and ... got to be really shed some light on different income streams instead\nOf the market we're talking a little bit about passive income we're talking about active and can we are talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we learned and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there and those multiple streams of income\nI really would create that financial freedom that everybody's after right not just that one source and that one source of income when you have that sole source that's why job stance J. O. B. right stands for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we want to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big us we've had big downs and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes via social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire\nOr just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it so it's kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our\nAudiences the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody here it's going to protect your capital better than you can right now and the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand or fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is\nThis is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and I've been doing this pretty pretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at an all time highs\nNow when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their traits to be able to maximize\nFor their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night is is the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting printed off right but the markets still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kind of got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so\nIf we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible forced to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets is whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that uh when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I Want to share it are there but it was just kind of funny you say you can't live or stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and then honestly why would they write\nAnd Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end it was kind of courses that can sound nobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they are that the stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who's closing their retirement and they have this perpetual kind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional and the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up uh falling behind the eight ball in the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have their class coming up in your area\nThey have to Costa Rica see exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways now included with your half the class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little a lot of our students have figured out they can use other types of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something to happen like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so for all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is restored how what what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time what what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your to your portfolio every year 'cause really your risk is only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this half the class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio and imagine\nThat you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nInsanity and you know step finished um insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome most people live in a very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nIs they read a book or go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching well I can tell you what's amazing\nThat what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time and it's the only profession you can do this\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplified trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam side innocent this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd I think that's an important concept to remember because\nNot like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our county right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and\nThere's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets or a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do there well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks show up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account is the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your alive and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight this year they came out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself\nThat you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but it used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan\nThat step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because in the end we are we going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions and I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow and\nThe only attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials and they're\n... they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month ... gym membership skyrocket but at the same time that putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and we have to do\nDo what we have to do what it takes to accomplish we go we want to lose a little weight we gotta spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have their classes and we've got this stack the second tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left would you give away let's do it\nRight now I've got a ... class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really live that life that you won't get your money making money in and I would like to see what he got two dollars or two million dollars you'd be able to see exactly what it takes to get that money generating that income that can really sustain that lifestyle that you deserve now\nInclude with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders ticket and this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kid makes it so you can get started right now

now as far as your instructor team to really help people take control their lifestyle help people do the things they want to do\nTo help them get over procrastination right I mean it's amazing how many people spent so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with a reason why they can't do something and what have you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now he's a procrastinating of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money so I asked you to solve the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job or if

what\n\nMore hands on ABC Los Angeles Orange County a cumulus station\n[noise]\nJournalist death rags to protest I'm In ... Germany is demanding further clarity from Saudi Arabia after admitted that turn us democracy ... was killed during a fist fight and its embassy in Turkey correspondent Tara Westwood on the U.S reaction\nAh well I'm doing the same thing you're doing time I'm continuing to to practice law and it's a it is a passion and it is a love and ah so I Am continuing to do what I've done for a number of years now and in the most recent vein what's up with me is uh\nUh when we talk about corporate abuse ... misused and or a arrogance a I'm a I'm representing that family ah down in orange county a whose son was killed by executive of Hyundai Corporation\nAnd a Hyundai that only a new about a hit and run incident that involve one of their corporate executives their corporate culture produced it\nAnd to make it even more reprehensible day uh for three days left the family wondering who it was that it struck their son in a drunk driving incident and they spent those three days helping their executives get to the LA Airport put him on an airplane and sending back to er Korea outside the jurors\nThe ... of the United states of America so uh that's kept me fairly busy and it's something that uh I feel passionate about and I know you\nFeel the same you know widely in amazes me\nIs I go through my legal life of the stuff that goes on out there uh in the corporate world\nFrom the standpoint of what they do with their shareholders from the standpoint of a situation like you just had from the standpoint of uh doing a terrible acts and the one thing I think uh my mom taught me\nBecause I used to a whole bunch of terrible acts I used to throw my socks behind the door or I didn't clean up my room I didn't make my bed and there was a whole laundry list of things you need to go to confession so well you know you try you know but\nThe one thing that did take place is that my mom taught me how to say I did the wrong thing\nHow to apologize when you've been rude to somebody how to apologize when you whatever it was that was wrong and Jane Gerard he definitely have that down\n... already apparently is sorely missed in corporate America\nBecause as I go through these cases like some just like the ones who described you have fewer and fewer members of corporate America saying hey listen we did the wrong thing you know if if companies were to do that\nIf companies would say hey listen ah we put out the bad pet food\nMaybe your pet since died I don't know what your legal rights are enough to can sue for wrongful death of a dog but I Know this is really harm due we wanted to do something for you we first of all we promise you will never happen again we would like to help you get a new dog\nOr we will pay for that we will do those things\nThey would go they would come off is the greatest company in America without a doubt and probably wouldn't even cost him that much\nAnd it seems to me that if it's icy the acts\nAnd maybe I'm John does but I Want you to tell us it seems to me the corporate America squeezes more and more a lot of people that shouldn't be squeezed and once they're caught they have no ability to apologize\nWell you and I know that the most devastating thing they're going to have it in a courtroom and for good is when somebody walks into the courtroom and accept responsibility and says I'm Sorry\nUh but you and I can count on the fact unfortunately ah that that's not going to happen because they don't accept that responsibility and the only way we can make them except that responsibility\nA is through the marvelous system we have in this country in the right to a civil jury trial and twelve members of our our society\nA and I want to speak just for a moment about civil justice system and about the the right to trial by jury\nOr oftentimes we hear criticism of it and oftentimes we hear people say well why do we need a jury why why don't we just have a judge\nWell there's a couple of really disturbing things that have been happening as we know for instance when we had gotten in the courtroom and gotten the common person who sits on juries\nTo stand up and speak out against this corporate abuse this corporate fraud this corporate arrogance we're now seeing an act of Supreme Court there that just this week we've seen a front page article in the Los Angeles times\nWhich analyzes the current United States Supreme Court and with the lists all of the major victories before that court the so called Roberts' court\nThat that's even more right of the Rehnquist Court and has been totally wiping out jury verdicts and citing almost a hundred percent with corporate America\nSo if we ever need a lesson as to why the jury system is so important and why we need to keep the average citizen involved we see that exactly happening or with the Supreme Court\nWe also then look and see what kind of performance level we're getting out of the executive branch of the government or with a approval rating of less than thirty percent then we'll look at Congress and we see an approval rating of less than thirty percent\nSo I think that our forefathers\nA with a simple bill of rights and simple constitutional right of the seventh amendment to the right to trial by jury they had it right back in Seventeen Seventy six and shortly thereafter and they still have it right today and\nWe get vindicated that as we trial lawyers of the civil justice system or when we see that that is the one institution that keeps us all honest keeps us all going straight a and make such a major market because without them it would just be these institutions which are causing a great deal of difficulty for we're going to\nPause for just a moment as you listen to champions of justice which tones are already in any Solomon our

I asked her into a number one to sound a little bit like a\nAn economic question the reality is is we don't have the resources and we don't have the money that we're the we're taking on special interests were taken on usually large corporations with huge amount of resources so they have the ability to advertise and twist the facts and take out full page ads and\nAnd come up with all of these various ways of attacking and shooting the messenger\nSo there's no question that they have had a very well orchestrated campaign to shoot the messenger\nThe other thing that we have to recognize that isn't you know we were never meant to be popular so when someone says that the travelers are on popular that tells me something I think it's very important it tells me that we're doing a good job\nWhere we are eight to ... here to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted and nobody is necessarily going to be in favor of somebody who comes in and shakes up the pot and shakes up society\nSo as soon as we started becoming the loved and liked and as soon as we started being invited into all the right country clubs and as soon as we started getting invited all the right cocktail parties where it's not doing our job\nSo to some degree I think we have to look at the criticism as a badge of honor\nBut it also has to be a recognition\nThat hopefully the public will get wise to the fact that they've decided if you want to stop civil justice system\nIf you want to stop the victims and consumers from having their rights protected then you got to get the messenger and they've they figured it out and they've spent a lot of time and effort and money and it's like I talked about corporate culture they've spent a great deal of Madison Avenue advertising dollars to create a culture\nIn which the criticism of the trial lawyers and the criticism of the attorneys is acceptable because that's exactly what they want it\nWe're talking about media culpa and you had a case of where you represented a couple against Disneyland\nOut at Disney handle it well or the case of that that you're referring to is the case that involved the family that lost their son or the the wrongful death case where the young twenty two year old boy was killed on the big thunder mountain right\nAnd and the gas in the process of investigate in that case that clearly there were some people\nWho maintain that train a that caused that trained to crash and cause that horrible death there were people who are operating a train who could have pulled the train on it\nRight even though they knew it was having a great deal of of problems so again you would look at it and say okay well so does him as responsible because their maintenance people left it in an unsafe condition Disney's responsible because of the people who ran the train who could have made the decision to take it off the track chose not to do so\nUh but that's only half the story\nBecause what we discovered was that this and they had a process any program we're all of the people you interviewed who ran the rights that are of course we didn't remove the the train off the track\nWe would get in trouble for that they got to turn these things over we've got long lines we got to move these people onto the train and if we pull that train off the track and it was found out not to be a a seriously in trouble even though we had strong strong\nSuspicions that there was a problem with that particular train and then we would be criticized and we could lose our jobs so they were intimidated not to take the train off the track\nWhat happened with the people who were were maintaining the train these\nIndividuals' were had been working\nAssigned to particular rides that's how Walt Disney\nOr when we brought this case we were on the side of all this neither do we just weren't on the side of Michael Eisner but Walt Disney when he set up Disneyland had these workers each knowing each individual rights and assigned to work on that ride so to the event the problem\nOf course along comes in efficiency genius who says well let's just have a pool of maintenance people for the whole park\nThey don't know each individual right they don't know it's it is secrecy and the maintenance people are not well trained and then of course that is going to cause a problem which resulted in death\nWhat happened in the Disney case\nWas not only did it take a long time and a lot of hard work to get the case resolved for this very very deserving family what the family wanted\nWas an apology and they wanted Disney to publicly apologized for the death of their son and we spent more time\nNegotiating a simple I'm Sorry than we did the amount of the settlement\nAnd that is what's wrong with our society when we play so much value on the dollar and the future dollars to be made all does need to think of is what can we do not impact the money we hope to make in the future even though it's our fault\nAs you say and I'm Sorry going to somehow impact the bottom line down the road and that became the negotiating point even though they knew and the evidence was overwhelming in terms of their wrongful conduct\nSo um why they we represented the little boys and got so badly hurt on the Roger Rabbit ride um the ride was such that it didn't have guards and so little kids could get thrown out of it and so forth\nAnd with that family wanted this was after your case was more than anything they wanted some medical protection for a little boring\nBut they they wanted an apology and I'll tell you a great of a story little boys in hospitals have been in the hospital for many weeks\nAnd there was an interview by the uh Orange County paper and they asked him his favorite person and he said oh my favorite person is the best Drew Sloan now somehow this interview got back to history Stallone", "show_name": "The Peter Tilden Show", "station": "KABC", "day": "20", "city": "Los Angeles", "state": "CA",
