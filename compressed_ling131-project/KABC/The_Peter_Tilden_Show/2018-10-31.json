bureau that a lot to get to today I Want to talk about the nature of anti Semitism the relationship between rhetoric and violence but we begin today with the president of the United states make them kind of a shocking announcement he says he wants to push for an executive order that would outlaw birthright citizenship and the president of the United states\nHas now said in an interview that he is interested in signing an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrant children\nSo here in the way the law currently operate if you come to the United states for virtually any permanent Missouri or end up on it you come to the United states and you have a baby in the United states that maybe is automatically a citizen of the United states entitled to All right and privileges\nConferred upon all citizens of the United states the reason that this is a controversial issue is because nothing in the constitution actually said that the case\nNot only does nothing in the constitution actually said this is the case\nPretty good evidence that the framers of the fourteenth amendment\nHad no intent to do anything remotely like this suggests that just because you come to the United states and then you have a baby hear your baby is now in the United states citizen and this does have some pretty significant cost involved right now you have in California in many stories about that you've had situations where\nLegitimate birth tourism is happening people are traveling to the United states just to have babies in the United states that their kids become American citizen\nAnd there's some pretty significant impacts the center for Immigration Studies which is very anti illegal immigration\nAnd they estimate that between three hundred and four hundred thousand children are born to a legal immigrants in the United states every single year meaning one out of every ten birds in the United states is ... illegal immigrant mother all of those children are considered\nBy the executive branch of US government to be us citizens enjoying the same rights and privileges as he put the children of us citizens the population of U.S born children with illegal alien parents has expanded rapidly from two\nPoint three million in two thousand three to\nFour million in two thousand eight and that's not include children who are Eighteen years of age or older the actual figure\nIs actually somewhat larger all of the benefits that are available to American citizens are obviously available to these American citizens there's a lot of talk about illegal immigration not having a tremendous impact\nOn the American economy because he legal immigrants are barred from federal welfare for example there are children however are not and this does lead to chain migration because children are not us citizens and they can sponsor their parents for United States citizenship the center for Immigration Studies suggest\nThat many of the welfare costs associated with illegal immigration are due to current birthright citizenship policy they take greater effort to barring illegal aliens from federal welfare programs do not reduce costs because the kids are still American citizens nationwide forty percent illegal alien hot headed households received some type of welfare in some states the rate is higher\nIn New York forty nine percent receive welfare in California at forty eight percent only Nineteen percent households headed by native born citizens\nMake use of a major welfare program in other words illegal alien who have American citizen children are taking advantage wealth or ... minute rate\nAnd states offer additional welfare benefits as well this is all according to the center for Immigration Studies again the LA county supervisor estimate that illegal immigration\nAnd birthright citizenship cost taxpayers in LA county over a billion dollars annually not including education costs a lot a lot of money if you nine percent illegal aliens and their U.S born children live in or near poverty\nAnd again than these kids are able to sponsor their parents for residency in the United states there's a lot of talk today about this is racist is the Trump Administration trying to simply by people who are differently colored from coming into the United states you\nKnow there are serious economic costs associated with lower income people and lo and poorly educated voters who are illegal immigration and illegal immigrating to the United states\nComing here having babies that could become citizens\nAnd now their kids are entitled to all the benefits that American citizenship\nConverse so President Trump suggested today that he could change all of this by executive order here's what he said he said it was always told me they needed a constitutional amendment guess what you know and and then he said it definitely can do it with an act of Congress and now they're saying I can do it with just an executive order\nI was

obscenities scaring a small shop first off\nIs none of your business second how dare you\nI mean how dare you threaten the child me it's one thing but my child you were mentioning this fire I Do want to thank the people who intervened and for those good people we interacted with yes liberalism is alive and well we had the displeasure of dealing with the fruits of so called tolerant left so\nWhat do you think now he didn't end up apologizing\nThe following day um he said he recently did it for historical purposes but admits he didn't think through the idea\nUm by love that he's saying now I guess some people thought it was in bad taste\nOr the rabbi to temple made a statement concerning how people should be mindful of what costumes they wear during Halloween Robert ... says costumes stairs or somebody in a time listening your costume stirs up an event where millions of people died than you should avoid wearing the costume the fact that the father apologized is important\nThe fact that he did not know the costume would be offensive is a very sad reflection on our society\nA good rule of thumb would be if you're crossing calls to mind that event or millions were killed\nChoose another cost him so what do you think people just happens almost every year\nI'm somebody dresses as Hitler\nLike Prince Harry the French are a thing always fascinated me\nBecause he or she there the royals I'm sure they took him to a warehouse where there were eight million costume choices and he said no\nI'm doing a Nazi and they kept saying Harry Harry clown juggler\nStill Walker ... anything now really I'm really sticking with the I think speaks to me than I Am fix really really sticking to me and then to push back happened of course cause for that very reason he could have picked any outfit in the world and he chose to use the Nazis so\nWhat do you think on Halloween is it okay to were announced a your uniform or Hitler on Halloween because it's a you can say it's historical be others are out there who are killers um people did horrible stuff although I don't think the whole pot\nA outfit is that big this Halloween up your Charles Manson of other killers out there so I'd love to hear ... now say tongue Al Capone um although I don't think anybody does Capone anymore I think that's kind of over\nEight hundred to two to five to two to\nIf you think Hitler's appropriate or inappropriate or not the uniform on Halloween is it OK and there's no explanation that can go along with that\nThat makes a whole lot of sense to push back it was great I'm I'm looking and I feel you know I feel badly for the kid the kid didn't didn't say can I be Hitler again I'm really taken the Hitler during\nThe dad dress them up and thought it was cute that they go to some an artsy and Nazi guard and Hitler so they can really make a statement I Wonder what the wife winters I Wonder if she also was involved in the Nazi theme\nTheme Halloween so and again the poor kid if he really was yelled at and people did really yell at the Senate he's at him that's wrong because again the kid didn't I don't think the kid did anything wrong the kids just\nJust went along for the ride with that and the ... doesn't know the history of a Nazi Germany and um and what he was even doing other than its dress up time and boy you know what when you look back like photo albums I don't have that many photo albums where my dad got to spend time with me 'cause he worked\nMonday through friday and Saturday is half a day so we didn't get to do a whole lot of stuff we went to a couple of ballgames cetera\nBut I remember those moments and they're wonderful memories this kid is going to have a memory back when he looks in his photo album of hey do you remember the time what was the best time with you and your dad were you really got to spend quality time together oh they have to be the day when he when is the Nazi guard and I got to go as Hitler we spent the whole evening\nGetting getting candy in that the that seem and then I Do remember the night and did not so well we got yelled at and people\nPeople started feeling obscenity Danielle obscenities backup man we got to spend all of that time together and do you put that in the photo album now or the other question is where did he rent the Nazi where do you go and rent a Nazi ... outfit today\nOr Hitler outfit or did you have it in his closet already and if you had in the closet already that begs another question how did he [laughter]\nUm I don't have a Hitler out for it or not see guard outfit hang in my closet are ready to go for Halloween so\nUm if you have an answer to that too can you even go to a to a costume store and rent and Hitler or not the effort I guess today you can because it's the the Internet so I'm guessing you can find anything on the Internet or let me go to Michael in la harbor\nHi Michael the morning [noise] just a morning what do you\nHave the right to do it yet because\nIt's All right thank you know there seems to be a lack of understanding and society about what is right to do even though you may have to do it and I think the guy's a complete on but um and the less he has a right to be more on just like you have the right to jump off a bridge\nAll this ... this will put to the fact that he didn't know is kind of a frightening and the fact that he wouldn't understand why he would get pushed back\nThe other part of that when I say that there are other killer is out there because that was part of the pushback was well you see Charles Manson to kill it out the pond was a killer I don't think people marching today to a flag that housed Al Capone on it it will you do you still see Nazis marching and you of anti Semitism increasing\nA so called Taj Jim was sold out so\nNo one can you can read Charlotte's white can go now because of that I'm going online or they just see if they even have a pool party cost him and I'm curious I guess you can buy Hitler costume on line right\nWell I suppose you can I may just like at the clock on the spraying an overdose but it's not the only thing yeah you know ...\n... ... and I appreciate I appreciate that and again it happens every year this one got huge huge pushback and ... let me go to Germany in Burbank Germany the morning\nHey how's it going\nGood so what do you think the guy dressed up as Hitler in himself as a a Nazi Nazi soldier and didn't get it now after the fact he's had a bit of an awakening but he wasn't wasn't sure why\nYeah I I kind of think that the uh the Hitler should not be dressed up as just like the black states I mean it's it's one of those things that you look down on every single every single person should look down on it and I don't I don't think it's a good thing\nIn by the way the other part of this the other component is you still have Nazis rally and trying to gain power so it is very true very true it's out there and nobody as I said is marching under the guise of Al Capone troops without compounds out there you know what I mean\nThat have a right that that have anything they're trying to accomplish so well I thank you for that and what would you do what do you do you see a guy\nI have never confronted that although I did when I was in um\nGosh I was in Nashville last couple of years ago and I'm standing in line at a fast food place and the guy in front of me in line takes off\nHis shirt and he's got Hitler Hitler's head tattooed on his shoulder almost actual size wow yeah wow\nSo I didn't know ... it was so shocking and so all putting in so stunning I didn't say anything but man that was kind of frightening right the actual science of it's almost like a what's his name Roger Stone has not not the same comparison but has Nixon's at back or if you've never send thank you Dr if you haven't seen that go on line\nAnd type in Roger Stone\nGoogle it go to images and you will immediately see images of Roger which are always compelling Lee and funny because of his hair and because of his office he wrote Roger has bought I think he told me bought outfits that he had custom made\n... spoke shoots that he had made in the seventies with the big big uh lapels and stuff that he still wears because their cost of the main so he looks or [laughter]\nSome days you could look like a pimp but um they're interesting outfits but there will be multiple of pictures of him with his shirt off\nAnd he used to be a really buff and like a weightlifter body and you'll see on his back\nIs Richard Richard Nixon tattoo of Nixon's head a and I don't know I mean I knew he worked in the Nixon White House and he was a huge fan of Nixon's but I don't know why you would put that\nAnd have a tattooed on your back unless you are you going to prison and that way I guess you wouldn't be mounted from behind in yourself because it would be off putting to anybody who would try and find you sexually attractive\nIt's maybe a deterrence the only thing I can think of why Roger would do it in his back I'm certainly not these are real they killed a lot of folks during the war we fought to defeat him we're still fighting on a ... it's a free country you can do it but the fact that you don't have an awareness that that somebody actually wrote\nI recall some of the funniest Three Stooges episodes were the mocking and satirizing Hitler and they were used by the way most dressed as Hitler um I think a that was way back to be they were making fun of Hitler\nJust as Mel Brooks did in in do you remember what it was I'll give you a little bit of a little bit of a hat I remember this or we go\n[noise]\nThe other part of this by the way she was just thinking\nAbout is that you know there's still people who were the last of the survivors of the Nazi death camps who can you imagine them out there walking around seeing somebody dressed as Hitler\nAnd having the number number that is tattooed on their arm and knowing that their families were obliterated and slaughtered\nUm and here's somebody dressing as it were thinking that it's funny or it's cute or it's controversial or whatever so yeah I think the gentleman who called and said it's the equivalent of a black raised\nAh blacks leaving the Democratic party but black it does not indicate blacks we never would have been better if it's ... it but blacks that everyone who so I'll tell\nYou more about Chinese flip how is the administration now going to deal with that because so much good work was done that day\nIn the White House when Carney was there uh as far as abolishing the thirteenth

and see you later all\nOf a sudden if I apply for a a permit um there's no way a first of all if I'm a legal I don't want to draw attention but second even if I Am legal ... running generates a lot of unreported income so why would I pay for a permit\nThen forces me to report my income or to pay taxes that's another one of those things that just doesn't make any sense to me and I love your from store owners are about this potential\nLicensing of street vendors I mean city hall is trying to move that thing forward how would you in force we don't have enough\nPolice we don't have enough to enforce what we have now are you going to send people out to enforce street vendors they're saying to her side on a city block\nIt would allow the creation of special vending districts with customized rules allowing more or\nFewer vendors in the area again if I'm a store and I've got an inventory up and I've got to pay minimum wage and I've got to do all the hoops are going to jump through and then I got a vendor opening and selling tacos and I'm going to talk of restaurant I Would not be really happy about that\nProperty of some ... some of the ten continues it looks like a late breaking news if it's a mystery for tribute body was to dismembered any premeditated and putting to turkey will have an update on that who's more engaged in the mid term our troops to the border\nIs impacting uh Trump's base we're gonna talk to Sean sold them political boarded the Washington Post next to find out the answer to some of those questions also want to talk about some local news and I'm Mr we use our law sort of using him of harassment again\nIn the wake of an alleged affair so we'll talk about that local politics and more when Peter told me ten continues right after the news here on TALK radio seven Ninety KBC [noise]\nThey concluded that they need to energize their base and right now they're talking about the issues whether it's immigration whether it's cabin on\nThe issues that motivate the base and that they feel polarized electorate and written mind voters of the hardest allegiances in these states where you just have more Republicans and Democrats\nThat said democratic messaging is that cutting through and is it still about healthcare is it's still about preexisting conditions in Obamacare and demonizing noticed large thing we're going to take away your pre existing coverage and your your premiums are going to grow up in his resume\nWell Democrats are indeed it's focused heavily on health care and they really haven't stopped focusing on health care\nEven as some of these other issues have common to the news they say look our data shows this is a powerful issue this is a powerful motivator even some Republicans I talked to said yeah they acknowledge that health care is not a\nGreat issue for them to run on a which is somewhat strike\nAnd given that in previous elections Republicans basically set up their campaign around health care they promise to repeal and replace Obamacare and they tried to do that last year and it and it didn't work and some Democrats feel that they had a really really powerful message to tell\nTo talk about a hundred health care and that it's taken ... mind voters about the Republican efforts to repeal and replace the APA ethic remind voters about the Republican lawsuit against the AC a than they have a chance of convincing not just democratic voters swing voters\nIndependents Republicans are voting for them and so they're trying to stay laser focused on health care right now even when Trump just talking about\nImmigration border security birthright citizenship and other things they're just running ad after after ad that talks about health care speech after speech after speech that talks about health care and they believe that\nThis will be the key to their success in a potentially winning the house and you know right now there's not a lot of uh guarantees there's yeah Democrats can win the Senate but some believe that they have an outside shot and if they're going to do it health care is the way that they're going to do it\nBecause you want to know when we got you for about two more minutes but I got to ask you about this because it's so bone headed\nThat the special counsel's office mullahs office has reached out to the FBI to investigate claimed that women were offered money in exchange for using Muller of sexual misconduct you're basically in less you play seven steps ahead when you're messing with the\nSpecial counsel's office all he has to do is pick up the phone call Rosenstein and say hey will you check this out this is what we're hearing plus he's got this whole workforce sitting there\nBut he can say hey you five would you investigate this right away so we've been hearing rumors about it for a couple of weeks but it just burst open now where are we without trying to negate Muller by saying hey some women are going to come out and they're going to drop a bombshell next week looks like that's not going to happen\nLike that where the ah situation stands a lot of things on the campaign perspective it's it's certainly a reminder that uh the investigation\nIs still ongoing that Mueller has still not drawn a a public conclusion about what's going on with a you know ... stuff that he has been looking at and so in terms of the terms you know that could be if I could be at the fact of the spectrum nice could remind voters um that\nYou know that investigation started though even though we haven't seen any uh conclusions come of that\nBut what about these guys who tried to tried to set this thing up he was so bone headed and done in such a dumb way that was found out right away um they are there are other attacks that are being planned against moment to kind of discredit them as we get to the one yard line and I'm guessing this thing starting to wind up\nYeah like I said I'm not I haven't really been following not that close like I started to the mid term impact you know I think that this could be something that reminds me of the special counsel\n... and just before you go I got to know from your perspective Kellyanne Conway and George the fascinated me the George keeps doing this\nOr to his wife by going after this ring and the president on policy when she's out there and has to confront that policy every single day and this latest was on the the birthright\n... is a one of the kind of dynamic that we are really not team play out publicly to has been disagree on\nReally really fundamental issues in such a public way both of them clearly appear to feel strongly about their dishes that they hold so this is a really unique situation a to look at\nYou know on a number of issues Ali stand them disagree on a and certainly the biggest one of course\nI was shocked himself on where you have Kelly and you know it's one of the staunchest defenders somebody who's worked from him a sore throat for awhile dating back to the campaign days I'm ... and her husband who was not at all and he never a inside a ... you know let that\nTrump doesn't ... ... is a really unique dynamic has he ever address redress or John has he ever gone after ... I mean Trump everyone there has never been done that yet\nYou know that's a good question I I don't know I I I Can't recall any situation when he's singled him out specifically um but uh there's certainly plenty of emphasis on the you know the other side where a he's chosen that clear that he's\nNot going to be making the pros and the completely not Sean I Know you're in the Russian I really appreciate you taking time with us and given us some insight out of Washington the Washington Post dot com it's winter is at W. A. post Sean and Sean thanks for on social and political reporter Washington Post or go to the rest of your day and thanks so much represented fake it\nTake it easy yeah you ... you can imagine it's a busy time with the election coming up and trying to get insight into every one of these races try and figure out\nIn today's world um how to look at polling and how to even see if the polling makes sense and how to change the questions we ask and then how to figure out\nWhat the responses are um if people are being honest about the response of ... about giving response in this polarized world ... there's some quote experiment are biased when you ask a question\nYou can word it in such a way that you get a certain answer uh also I always go back to the gym became a show when he goes out in the street and his folks questions and they don't have any idea and yet they're willing to give an opinion or Jay Leno when he was doing Jay walking the u._s. people are opinion on stuff they give you a very strong opinion that sounds like they're\nEducated and and and we're read on the issue and then you ask them second question like who's representative and they have no idea\nSo when you're doing pulling now in this in the age of Trump where everything is different since the presidential election you look at these polls in in a different light or if you don't know the story by the way\nThe about the special counsel if you have to buy in investing it claims that women were offered money in exchange for accusing Moore of sexual misconduct\nOr the spokesperson remote because he hasn't talked since he's been doing this investigation Peter car issued a statement saying that when we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the special counsel we immediately for that matter to the FBI or the amazing thing about the story is\nThis guy jak Berkman who was a lobbyist\nTweeted that Thursday he's going to reveal the first the special counsel Robert Mueller's sex assault victims like this bomb show was coming out\nHe said I applaud the courage and dignity and grace and strengthen my client um Berkman\nBy the way promoted conspiracy theories regarding the chef rich unsolved killing themselves rich where his family said ... stop 'em and they have been all his everything he espoused was disputed by law enforcement officials\nSo this began about a couple of weeks ago when email account to belong to a Florida woman\nA began contacting reporters 'em and\nClaiming that this mysterious individual had offered her money to save mother had behaved inappropriately when they work together in the seventies the person sending emails wouldn't speak on the phone but claims he was offered tens of thousands of hours to say negative things about the special counsel\nAnd it appears that the person who had been emailing reporters are those two weeks and said she was told the Berkman was behind the effort to pay those who made the allegation against more\nSo than this guy Jacob wall looks like he's also been involved in this hunt to dig up dirt on smaller and um they said the Berkman told him he'd hired Matthew Cohen remember that name who's going to be managing partner at a private investigation company called surefire intelligence\nTo assist with the investigation and out\nMueller for all the sexual activity will it appears that Cohen is this guy will\nEnsure fire which deleted it's Craig's list advertisements said it was founded by and they claim that they were founded by Israelis Israel's elite intelligence community and they said do to counter intelligence private spies the ethical hackers um and then had all these employees the company\nHow ... twenty Eighteen you put up pictures of employees of your

of who was one of the Israeli operatives it just so happens is that station chief use the photo of\nThe Israeli supermodel bar Raphael e ... which is\nOn how you didn't know that that's a famous
