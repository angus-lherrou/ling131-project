Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues today correspondent Abby Philips reports the scope the investigation is limited\nPresident Trump promised L. or something they did\nThe only thing but before we move on to cabinet which is a big story in and will continue to be a ... and I fell in love every ... wrote me beautiful letter she actually in West Virginia was talking about the two of them having a love of a love affair ... ... and that [noise]\nUh he's going to go back for a second round of meetings now I'm curious what I'm reading and hearing is it they're not happy with my compared because they feel that the Trump directly to Kim promises stuff makes promises they actually can move forward\nThey didn't want to meet with Pompeo and the president said don't go over there 'cause nothing's happening nothing's moving forward as far as the nuclear is Asian\nBut it looks like they only want to talk to the to the top guy that had to buy\nIn the grand ... who is not an experienced international diplomat and for\nWho deals are typically involve real estate as opposed to you know denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula um this is yeah I I just a lodge in what would happen on Fox News if if Rocco by my head said he had fallen in love\nWith Kim Jong un just remember how much grief ever gave a George George Bush ... he had looked into vitamin ... so this is you know once again I think an indication of the fact that we're living in a new political age here\nBut it you know what I remember going back having Tony Blair on the show and I asked him because he was promoting his book and he was promoting the fact that he didn't mess up in the least you know he was doing that to her and this is let me ask you as a world leader\nIs it all about relationships like if you don't like somebody hard to do the deal and if you like somebody easier and he said you started laughing I said I wanted to go into exile six if ...\nIf you want somebody to get along it's much easier if you don't it's almost impossible um and then he made a joke about somebody not using their name a foreign leader that you're always hated so it is relationship based still it still comes down to I guess to people in the room\nYeah it is and and I think that's evident in as the President Trump's relationship with a lot of this world leaders you know he is he's pretty frosty with people like a angle Merkel the chancellor of Germany or with Justin Trudeau\nYou know the prime minister of Canada after a couple of a nice friendly meetings they'd gotten to a little fight over this trade deal apparently things are passed up now\nOne of the really fascinating things to me is the relationship with the president has with\nA Shinzo Abe's prime minister of Japan or they have gotten along famously\nPrimarily because since all of a nose sort of how what buttons to press with President Trump\nAnd by the way I Am a is a a a pretty good golfer himself so I think they've spent some time I'm all linked together to uh but you know foreign countries are making a serious study of how to get in President Trump's good graces it's something that every country does with every new American president on it just sort of matters more for this guy\nAnd are we hearing anything that the managers and the others are happy with what's going on there that it looks like they actually may take some steps to denuclearize and give us something tangible are they waiting for us to make the next move\nYeah I I don't think that there is anything that has actually moved sense a President Trump's initial a meeting with a with Kim a side from the repatriation of\nWhat was at fifty five or so of of bodies from the uh the Korean War so there there's there's something but that's a minor step and sort of the much grander scheme of actually denuclearizing which you know I think I told you at the time and still remains the case is gonna be a years long project\n... move on to comment on ... so he always is investigating they've gone to a timeframe because they don't want this to drag on\nAnd it's limited in scope the president said he he it's not limited and that they can interview anybody they want\n'em yet some of his his folks around Conway\nIn us or Huckabee Sanders said there's limitations 'cause they don't want to winding outta control of that but there's confusion as to who is setting the parameters one or the parameters I Know the White House counsel Don McGahn is involved in guiding the Senate and the president saying the Senate\nIs deciding but if McGahn is directing the Senate\nAnd the president's directing McGahn ... the president's directing the investigation so what are the browns merely clarity on\nLaw and and remember that it is it is truly only the president who can direct the FBI to undertake this examination are now the FBI could open something on their own is asked by the Senate but then again that would probably come from the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nWho has a a pretty strong interest in getting Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the court so there are there are certainly constraints that is not accurate to say\nThat the FBI could look at whatever they want\nA in the course of the next week than the fact that this is only a week long as a constraint Internet itself um but there are allegations that are being looked into at least a couple of accusers have been contacted by the FBI according to reporting over the weekend a and this thing at the clock ticking but people are sitting down for interviews\nWith that that said okay this is this going to be the same situation on friday they were in going in where the Democrats are going to her was a sham they weren't asking shrimp people questions they didn't follow up on this they didn't do that\nAnd we're almost just the identical place I mean this gives some gives Collins and Murkowski and some of the red state Democrats cover saying where we did the investigation they found nothing else no corroboration so\nWe have to move forward it gives them covered but we would be I mean we're also heading to the midterms the Democrats are going to want to use this as a campaign a point\nTo draw people out I mean I'm I'm guessing if he gets in it's going to rally Democrats if he doesn't get and it's going to rally Republicans and that's probably pretty simplistic\nWell so this is ... ... this is basically an investigation meant to give cover or to the capital of the vote to remain undecided you mentioned Murkowski and and kind of runs the two Republican women\nThere's also Joe Manchin the Democratic senator from West Virginia who I I think wants to get to yes I think that's his his ultimate goal he voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch and he wouldn't mind are concerned Brett Kavanaugh are given the fact that his state voted for President Trump by like a forty point margin or something like that um the end\nAnd by the way through and Jeff Flake too who caused this whole a brouhaha at the very last minute or in the Judiciary Committee on on friday I was I was in a cab at the time and I have never heard a cab driver or anybody more enthusiastically listening to C SPAN radio and the play by play it was it was pretty pretty remarkable um\nThat being said you know you know almost no matter what this investigation comes up with first of all the FBI is not going to make a recommendation that's not what they do their job is only to ascertain truth or something like that so if you're a Democrat how\nWere you ever going to be satisfied with whatever items out of this of course they're going to say that this was way than that uh uh it was a you know there were a job and all that stuff we were in a very bad place last friday\nA win this Thursday and friday when the hearing and the vote or were taking place you know we're going to be in exactly that same place\nThat's where I figure I'll at the end of this week this this is not going to be a good week for American democracy let's put that\nOne no I'm I'm trying to play this out as a chess game and see where we're going to end up and we're going to end up there it's going to be split again and and the Democrats can be screaming and yelling Republicans and reporting fingered the Democrats\nAnd we're going to have a guy he's going to be appointed I mean to the to the bench but it's just it's an what an ugly ugly game and then the periphery of this what about Jeff Sessions is his job safe today does he go in every day and see if the key card works you know\n[laughter] they like to go through the door ten goes oh I Believe\n... presumably or the or the car that shuttles them to work in the morning wouldn't show up fifty ... charge\nOh is that how you doing I got it in your car do and how about Rosenstein he wants to sit down\nRight and that's a good question that it has been delayed now that was supposed to be last Wednesday or Thursday I Can't oh Thursday because everything in the universe happened on Thursday night has now been delayed there has there is no update on a on when he is going to meet with the president is it's\nPretty clear to me at this point that sessions in Rosen scene are safe through the mid term elections\nBut you know I kinda read during the during the hearing I kinda read Lindsey Graham's outrage as something of an audition for their job you know maybe there are some folks who are starting to think I could I could live on up here after the midterms if ah if Jeff Sessions gets\nThe boot oh there they all you've done this for a long time they're all ... all the time I mean they use the the face time or is this is not going out to a place that people think theater it is such theatre these guys spend three quarters of the day raising money and the other quarter of the day figuring out how they can have additional power\nRight and just look at the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee to the the outrage from kennel Harris or Cory Booker even you know any culture who who took a different tactic and in question Kavanaugh and that got some twenty twenty bugs um\nEverybody is auditioning for something I you know one thing about the United states if you're if the United states senator when you wake up in the morning you look at the mirror and see a future president look back [laughter]\nSo speaking of that what's the polling not that we all we're all look at polling skin smells you whatever\nI'm motives in midterm pulling looked like and how many people were thrown her hat in the ring for twenty twenty you're looking at Biden maybe look into one but you're looking at the two you mentioned you're looking at ... who who else when I was in one of the midterms were quite\nHow how much time do we have to name off to the Democratic my my stock answer whenever anybody asks me who's running I say all of them I think people are going to show\nUp to to you know to the Iowa caucuses

I just want to move on though about where you can still calling that 'cause it's a big issue as we get new information and and Senator Flake is talking about\nThe looking into new credible accusations but I wanted to call closer to home here because we we we see stories\nThere's somewhat outrageous and then the follow it never happens and we go on and we're paying for mistakes that they hope we forget about but it's interesting because this summer I did a story on the story was nearly times about these electric buses\nThat we have um they want to eliminate all public transit emissions by twenty thirty\nSo they begin retiring a fleet of big diesel buses and retiring the cleaner natural gas many buses replacing them with these new zero emission electric buses\nI'm the only problem with this is and this is a city that's asking for money for homeless these are the same politicians asking us money for gas tax or asking money for this that the other thing\nSo we left it to them and they got buses that don't run they're expensive they are trying to use and have big problems and the mayor said this is going to carry us into the future I called on friday of last week the the metropolitan agency to find out where we're at\nAnd I didn't get a call back 'cause I'm going to find out if these buses can't climb hills they break down really ... they're not reliable after being driven more than a hundred and ... hundred miles in and they're already a problem the first buses were so bad that it'd be pulled off their routes\nOr in under five miles according to some of the reporting Albuquerque New Mexico had problems like this uh when they tried switching to electric buses they ordered a fleet of twenty\nBut the a P is reporting that their performance was so poor the city quickly canceled the order and switch back the natural gas and clean diesel we however\nBeing who we are with getting I patched every student um we being smart and a big city that has some half than can make really good contracts negotiations and has some leverage behind us in April we get a thirty six million grant to purchase a hundred and twelve zero emission buses\nUm and the state ended up kicking into they spent nearly a million on the infrastructure for this maybe they didn't get the memo that it's not working but this is unbelievable these are like these are lemons I'm at the companies be windy which stands for build your dreams\nAnd a Chinese company and what you should know if you didn't hear the initial report is how this how this came about it might be a ton of at your longtime\nLA county supervisor was chairman of the metro board\nAnd in two thousand nine and ten he disclosed that he had stock his wife is the one who counsel the company I don't know what went on there but that sounds a little fishy to me it sounds suspect of something\nUm and then the stocks didn't appear on next this disclosure when he sponsored ... onto the thirty million dollar grant from the new bus technology\nAnd they keep supporting the initiatives that benefit that company including a plan to convert the entire fleet to electric vehicles and he supposedly help secure\nAlmost ten million incentives for BYU to establish headquarters and manufacturing facility in LA county so they can make the crappy buses that don't appeals right here in our own backyard\nSo in other people benefited from that too\nSo obviously obviously this company you know what they do they take people to China they the people on junk it's uh they took one guy to all expense paid weeklong trip to China in Ecuador they also hired his sister in law for an administrator post according to this\nAnd the amazing thing about these buses when the first buses hit the streets\nThey ever sixty nine miles between charges despite the promised that they could reach a hundred and fifty five miles it's just a tad short or the normal metro buses arrange for about three hundred and eighty five miles so this is a sixteen range before needing to refuel\nAlso stalled going up hills and acquired service ten times more frequently than the other buses so they actually had to buy their own buses back from metro every couple of months I'm and despite the problems that we're still funding more money towards the windy unless I get to call back here they made a change but I don't think they did\nA they got another forty seven million dollar contract last year to provide metro sixty buses\nThe ... despite the staff offering negative technical reviews and I saw them all the negative view reviews were\nLeft they were Yelp reviews you'd never go to the store um they requested ten million in grants to buy ... or a garbage trucks the sanitation and she doesn't even want so if you can explain to me how we as local taxpayers keeps sinking money and spending money on buses that don't work to electrify the\nBush week um I guess state and federal grants help but we got thirty six million the state wants to buy hundreds what what the buses these things appear to be a disaster yet\n... was as we always do we're moving forward with buses I guess you know when you do\nOne person was killed in
