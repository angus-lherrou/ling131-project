CNN in New York City was evacuated after a suspicious package that apparently looked like hype on what's on the air it's especially packages also received the New York city office of governor Andrew Cuomo sources told ABC News\nWhich should narrow it down a little bit of towns like this is probably somebody from New York state they're sending it to\nAndrew Cuomo as opposed to say governor Jerry Brown in California investigators are working at a tournament whether the two devices address the Clinton and Obama are connected to a pipe bomb out earlier this week in the home of mailbox\nA billionaire George Soros near where the Clinton's lead in chapel clock New York ... believe that all three devices are similar pipe bomb south instruction now immediate jump I felt on the left or to suggest that this was a right wing or who have left wing or is it has been inspired by President Trump\nAs I said for years now I despise when people blame individual\nViolence or attempted violent to an generalized political rhetoric unless you're actively calling for violence and someone takes you up on that offer you're not responsible for the violence the action of people who take you\nTo to the ultimate extreme in terms of violence so for example when he Bernie Sanders supporter wasn't shot up a congressional baseball game and nearly killed the house majority whip\nAnd the media covered it for all Fifteen minutes\nI didn't blame Bernie Sanders because I wasn't Bernie Sanders this fall when a when a kind of\nFringe member of black lives matter shot up police officers in Dallas a couple of years ago right after Brock Obama had made speeches condemning police officers and broadly racist I didn't say that that was Brock Obama's fault that wasn't Brock Obama's fault it was an act of evil on the part of a person who was actually evil or mentally ill or both\nAnd that had nothing to do with rock Obama's words I think you can raise the temperature in society and do serious damage to the society because you raise the temperature of that society but I'm not going to attribute individual acts of violence and evil to individual political viewpoints unless those viewpoints are actively calling for violence and to do anything less\nWe'd do the sort of censorship that makes the country at worst place in that way\nIf you believe that free speech is inherently connected to violent you're more likely to crack down on free speech in order to prevent that violence and that seems to be more of a broad danger than individuals in the United states who do evil thing so with that said obviously this is really really bad stuff and it goes to the question of motives\nBecause what we're seeing now why is this breaking up so much why are we seeing rice and sent to Susan Collins and may why are we seeing rock the moons of Thrones with windows and having the carp these offices in California\nWhy are we seeing bombs put in George Soros his mailbox it's because they're a group of people who have been fully convinced that the other side and I don't just mean the other side ideas I mean people were on the other side are actively members of evil they're Hitler and figures\nAnd that sort of rhetoric is is responsible for heating up the temperature it's not responsible for individual acts of violence but\nIt is responsible for an increase in temperature and the more you increase the temperature the more you can expect that they're going to be people who are going to go to the ultimate extreme of attempting to engage in violence you seen it on the left you see in the time on the right and it's really ugly no matter how you slice it seems to me\nThat a lot of this is springing from\nA basic failure of values and the basic failure values is something that we call and Hebrew there's a there's a Hebrew command that you're supposed to consider everybody in their best possible way that the human race where it has done cost ... which literally means that you're supposed to think of everybody's marriage\nWe don't do that anymore we tend to and said think of everybody demerits we tend to think of the worst form of everybody's arguments we tend to think the worst motives\nOn the part of people with whom we disagree we see someone say something in the first thing we think is not okay what's the reasonable explanation for what they're saying or what maybe were they thinking instead we immediately jumped to this person is the worst person in the world and the rhetoric is obviously intended for ... for the worst possible that now\nPaid for by

runs between him and might be nice to have them in the lineup Kennedy field of course the problem is yeah well ... is also the fastest guy in the team\nSo he has a lot of dimensions the problem is he has a lot of strike outs to yeah and that's what the Dodgers were trying to avoid but uh what they've been doing it hasn't worked there down ah oh to to the Bo Sox and\nA history says they're in trouble because if you lose the first two games of the world serious eighty percent of the time you go on to lose the world serious we don't want to talk about the book the Dodgers can come back you know we had to chat with mark ... reminded us that ah the Casey royals and he went on an eighty five\nThey came back after losing the first to the eighty one Dodgers lost the first to to the Yankees in the Bronx came back and won the world series so it can be done it ... if there's a twenty percent chance and uh\nThe Dodgers have to when they're home games they've got a whole surf now they've got to win these three games\nAnd ah they can certainly do that and the Dodgers team far be it for me to be Pollyanna but this Dodger team has had to deal with adversity and come back all year long from a miserable start\nOr ten games are under five hundred they managed to not only come back we're you forget they were in third place in September yeah uh and they got hot at the right time and they had to win a house in order to win the division they had to go up to San Francisco and take three from San Francisco and then they had to win the one game playoff with uh\nUh with Colorado in order to play Colorado\nAnd things like that all along in San Francisco and Colorado or not the Boston love no\nNo they're not really the best team in the you know that's the two behind their I mean that's why they're there but now it's time for the Dodgers to kind of suck it up and find whatever that magic is that enabled them to win when they had to win where did\nYou say ah who said it in Boston back when they were down over a three uh we got 'em right where we want to\nBurn it oh yeah right I ... down bring up under the Yankees and literally I said I have a straight face [laughter] no no we're going to when we got 'em right well we want him yeah\nAh so anyway uh it it's it's it's ... it's real crunch time now but you know Boston did with add to do that when they're home games so they held home field advantage the the Dodgers have to do the same no they don't win three in a row at home\nI Want to hear the analysis well the red Sox don't know what it's like to play a more a warm climate October\nThey're not going to have any problem adjusting to Ninety so going to feel great now now you know here's the deal uh the the the players will and you'll end up hearing all these cliches but the players are not the Dodgers are actually not going out there to win three in a row to going out there in one in a row three touch\nA but the first thing you do is deal with friday's game and

whittle and the number of pipe bombs that have been mailed a prominent Democrats has risen to ten\nAfter two package bombs address the former vice president Joe Biden were discovered in separate male facilities in Delaware early this morning and another package bomb arrived at Robert De Niro production company in New York\nTo keep them boys you know up to date on what the latest potential risks are and when there was an event like this and they just happened to be at the time Warner center when the package was discovered\nSteve do you know how many of packages had that get her done stick around with the uh\nThe ice just figure because they'll know odd sticker it's a sticker the specific\nYeah we we don't know at this point I'm an end again many of the um minute details have not been revealed officially through law enforcement at this point it and then that's pretty typical this stage in an investigation\nGuard was thank you for coming on and given us the update and for being there for hours yesterday when you were in the midst of that I really appreciate Steve ... can be she news contributors as ... at s cashed in bomb and we'll talk to you again um I was going to play some summer I'm waiting for my system to rebuild\nBut I can talk about it uh when we were in the area they were talking about how we got to the point of of of rhetoric and what's the cause of this even though we don't know who did it and I said let's hold off on ... she has to any kind of blame or being a a professional parliament with no new information\nOr as as you can hear from Steve there's not a wealth of information at this point which is just beautiful\nFor people with conspiracy theories because you don't need a wealth of information to pick out conspiracy theories I'm so right away um yesterday I didn't even realize as we're talking about it and we were and I appreciate the calls\nI'm as we were talking about conspiracy theories and let's not even go there because we have no idea what this is of course people\nDidn't have an idea what it is LOU LOU Dobbs looking at Lou Dobbs Fox Business host Lou Dobbs suggested on Thursday that the bond sent a prominent Democrats\nWere fake because\nWhy how um he said who could possibly benefit by so much say curry and I'm just thinking what would Lou Dobbs say if if someone he knew blew up a relative is blew up in New York a a a postal worker blew up\nA first responder blew up I really think that the left feels they're losing on many levels and I feel they're planting these devices just to play the role of the victim they form and YPG officer said on Fox and friends Thursday morning I'm also another guest another show suggested the bombs or a false flag orchestrated by a low level Democrat\nTo drum up fear of the midterm elections uh this is insane you realize this is insanity and I'd love to get your reaction to this and one of the clips I was going to play was Steve this on the morning show on Fox actually pushed back and I congratulate him on a guest who based loosely\nSuggested that the bomb threats are all part of a left wing operation um ... just the NYPD detective Vince and then I pronounce his name ...\nAh gave his take on the events of the last couple of days and you know pundits these guys come on and they won all seem as experts and remember people have an agenda experts come on people see them and this guy can get a job or maybe as a security expert off of his appearances on Fox\nMaybe a working with a company on security because he looks like an expert but to come on and no nothing not to be involved in the investigation not to hear anything from the police\nFrom any of the organizations that are investigating right now and by the way there's a reason they're quiet and they don't give up all the info that they have\nUm but right away he he's talking about it's a conspiracy what I think is this bomber um is they should be prices six oh you should be fired sent five or six doctors already none of them\nHave gone off I'd really like to have more information but that said he talks about ... conspiracy so uh\nIt's amazing guys like Lou Dobbs you just want to grab him and said dude ... how can you put this out there just as you believe something based on nothing does not mean that is not toxic putting it out there\nUm or somebody another former FBI assistant Chris worker or this could be someone trying to get the Democratic vote out it could be somebody who hates kneeling and the NFL it could be somebody who is slated to buy a Democrat when they were eight years old or let's just make stuff up\nAnd put it out there and this is what we're talking about in this toxic environment if we're really going to change it\nOr we all we all have to change our behavior the president\nThe media uh and if you don't want hatred and you don't want violence like this then you got to stop making excuses and the sad thing excuses\nWhen your team does something wrong whether you're on the left or whether and you're right we got to stop just take him on\nThe team and whatever they do is right and nothing's going to change until you do that\nYou got to hold yourself and your team accountable or just as you would the other side so tell me for eight hundred to two to five to two until people are willing to do that I'm In this polarized environment to look at their cells and say\nI'm doing the same thing they are um and we react\nEven if we're ... we're as if we're short the other side's fault 'em and everything now every story is is to quote spinal tap and eleven we always come to an eleven right everybody's there and everybody's castings version everybody knows they're right and we're all overwhelmed by our disagreements so we go to a lab and um and\nWe're all outraged and then more hostile because how dare you even suggest that that is a possibility or a solution for something into where were you look in the mirror and we all go hey we all got attempt we're all responsible everybody\nFor this environment if you keep if you keep making excuses for your team doing stuff than your part then you're part of the problem too so\nI see these false like stuff and I just I guess it's not going to change but it's disgusting it's insane these are people who don't know anything a lot of former disc jockeys former finance people somebody\nKnew somebody at a networking down a job and I work right now all of a sudden they're pundits they're giving expert opinion on who this is and what it is and where it came from and you say where did you get your information and they go ... or drop travel they pulled it right on my butt\nSo um it's just so easy it's so easy to do to decide what this is and how it happened but I look at these false like things came up right away and then you know the the cop out is oh I didn't say that's what it was I just suggested that's what it could be\nWell that's just as guilty if you're if you're in the media and you're putting it out there\nAnd the media is guilty we overreact president surely is guilty he overreact and it's got it didn't start with him it didn't start with this administration's been building for years\nBut it's gotten to the point where it really is toxic and unless we want to do something about it you can start yourself by being a little bit more accepting and not like I said when your team does something wrong\nCall it out not just because if your team All right I think I think that's the way we get to this I don't know if it's possible uh Eugene in Redondo let me get to hear the morning if you\nCan get a tournament\nNext house\nOn the game I Want to blame each other good so I thought okay if packages or sat by the Saudis and you think that's because while we're not talking about the show [noise]\nWell we're also not talking about the NFL kneeling we're also not talking about the caravan it could be sent by somebody in the Caribbean and could that\nCould be sent by George Soros could be sent by anybody so I have no idea yeah could be sent by somebody over ... ... yeah yeah\nJust as it could be sent by my cousin Louis ... we haven't you know we have no nothing to go by yet not a clue not a detailed we haven't heard anything so we can make guesses all day long and by the way how does that work out in your household I Know you can't you've got to be co pathetic because then you don't get to see each other naked ever\nBut you get into you get into heated arguments\nNo that that's the bigger paychecks like that\nBut at the [laughter] the other one ... but that's an interesting thing in a household to disagree and and to to agree to disagree and actually listen to each other and hear the argument you know that there was no large\nToday actually ever change your mind you ever changed her mind on anything on any issue and then he points\nNo cell as tall as much oil is to\nKeep I keep it on and how your children yeah after they\nTend to she pull them into a closet and go okay don't tell daddy I said this but uh he's wrong on that how do you how do you do to deal with the kids\nI I don't think it's as if all all day Saturday going [laughter]\nUh and I and I as a unit says my anniversary that's the best way to beat daddy is always wrong congratulations ... dollars a year right well thanks for the call I appreciate it and and and I think our state me I take it easy um\nAgain I Would I almost threw out when I saw I didn't know when we're talking about this yesterday on on the air and then at the same time Lou Dobbs was on there saying this is the fate their fake Bob he went out there and said it's fake bombs can you imagine Lou Dobbs they're fake bombs and it blows up a postal worker what up\nIts ... he's a moron he's a moron a total moron for doing how you can say unequivocally it's a fake mom when you know not you're sitting in the studio you're getting a paycheck\nYou're doing that for eyeballs because you want to say something that's a bit edgy and look at me look at me I Know something no one else knows it's it's despicable and again we're all going to have to do it and I'm sure I'm to blame over the years I'm sure\nOver the line a but I'll tell you what unless we all stopped sending our own teams as as if they can't make a mistake and everything they do is precious and the other side is definitely the enemy then we're we're going to be in a losing battle a sharing of gets you in just a minute 'cause we've got to take a break I'll start with you everybody else eight

I can say you had\nSeen are you there okay the media is guilty to weigh in what way the media eliminates the media has agendas okay and the media is driven by money okay right advertise up they\nWill let me finish let me let me let me finish the types of stories they've been when you have a CNN that is all day long hammering on one\nStory that it's not even based on a story it's based on some outlook on probably I'll tell you for ... let me finish a lot of their stories are based on something somebody said it was reported that someone so sad\nAnd then they have experts on to comment on the thing that was said by that person and they build it for twenty four hours instead of doing news so I can hear and we can hear what's going on on North Korea what's going on with Iran what's going on with homeland security what's going on with environmental stuff\nWhat's going on with bills that are potentially being passed that can affect us what's going on with health care\nAnd they will still twenty four seven they won't hammer and hammer and hammer\nAnd ... and so they have an agenda and Fox has an agenda and they play to the base and they play to the base and that's where the media has gone when when I was growing up when you were growing up maybe on and on average\nThere were three channels and we watch them for news we didn't wash 'em for pundits giving hung us who are not\nWho have no information look at this turned\nOn to the guy got any Margaret down yes yes\nAnd instead you put on a pundit who doesn't know his you know work from home on the wall and he's on that for ten minutes telling you what what he thinks this is all about you think that's healthy you think that's safe\nYou know health care is a beer or ... and in Washington BS as us on healthcare\nThey'd be ourselves on immigration for how many years they said they're going to do a comprehensive immigration reform so each side gets in demonize the other and nothing gets done nothing gets done I've been hearing about immigration reform comprehensive immigration reform and ah you verify and we can do this for how long civil why we get sucked into the lie\nAnd then every charge says the solution and they get in and they don't solve it so you tell me what's going on but we're all dug in for our team and we never ever able to say maybe my team is wrong on this one\nIt ... it was like the one show that a lot that really look up the other side as a ... it's just it's just been\nSo if we don't get past that and it's always going to be this device of politics it's just keeps getting uglier and uglier and you also wouldn't have to solutions ... it's it's ... you talk about you bring it up and maybe just because you're talking about it and you're saying you know what\nYeah maybe that is the way to go maybe other people listening now go maybe I shouldn't digging so hard for my team maybe they're also trying to rip me off or maybe they're also not being so forward thinking maybe they're not the smartest some years ago Newt Gingrich I forget how long ago three years five years go\nHillary said something and he said you know what we should always demonize the other side maybe she has something to say that's right you know what I mean but the hatred the hatred is so big that you couldn't say anything right ah and the hatred against the ... they couldn't sing right either she or shut yourself down and you deprive yourself\nFrom hearing something that may be part of a solution you\nKnow go back to the polls that real gonna Tip O'Neill ...\nThey did work together it was really ugly from what I hear from people who are there things done and you know what I think that was and this is really simplistic the difference is back then I think\nIs they used to spend a lot more time in DC and I think once you go to church and synagogue and baseball practice and ah 'cause the bake sale at your kid's school and you're there with somebody from the other side\nA and you're socializing and seeing them it's harder to hate that person I Know if I dislike somebody and they come on the show\nInvariably it's like oh he's not such a ... maybe you know maybe it's not saying something so stupid I think Washington used to be a ugly and harsh but maybe it had more civil only because they saw each other more now with the camp constant campaigning and the fundraising\nAnd social media and getting out there are they're much more isolated um and not as close to maybe and maybe that is simplistic answer but there was a different time and you're right at least Reagan and Tip O'Neill gave the impression that they were willing to work together in a\nLook Reagan Reagan became became love love because his ... his willingness at least and his likeability to reach out and try and compromise so thank you Jim I\nWant to look for ...\nWell you know what the the the the phrase is always a statement as always ... they can't have a third party when all all you have is one party masquerading as to I don't know if you agree with that but uh I think there's something to that thank you Jim talk when you're Seventy KBC\nAre you concerned about the volatility in the market

Los Angeles Orange County [noise]\n'kay ABC News live and local at eleven o'clock I'm Jeff with all the FBI\nNow trying to find the person who mailed at least ten pipe bombs to prominent Democrats who publicly criticized President Trump justice correspondent Evan boroughs reports\nIn the original definition of terrorism the idea is that uh it's about disseminating messages and causing air panic\nAnd that's successful whether the bomb is live or the bone is in just a prototype bomb that doesn't have the necessary component ordinance to actually do damage from what I understand the one that was sent to CNN\nWas live and it's only because at the NYPD had to bring in a special truck a containment unit to be able to put that package and so they took it very seriously\nAnd if the NYPD is taking it that seriously\nI'm taking it seriously I don't know how many of the packages or contain\nAlive ordinance or live materials that that could explode that also had his you know one of the bomb glass pieces and other kinds of shrapnel that we've seen in other kinds of\nHum bombs for example um with the with Ted Kaczynski smell bombs\nNail the people who carry the male people who worked for the U.S yes they were most at risk because just moving the bomb was enough to set it off so the question then becomes whether this is about you know making the news and having the twenty four hour news cycle covered this\nAnd that's been accomplished or whether they actually thought they were going to be able to get to by putting it in Georgia services mailbox in his home I shouldn't even measure\nDidn't send it to offices as much as they sent it\nIn some instances to people's homes where the return address from Debbie Wasserman Schultz which again when we talk about their sophistication there is a lot of typos there's a typo in the return address there's a type ... and John Brennan name the fact that Brennan doesn't work for a CNN he works for MSNBC so I think that\nThat there's enough mistakes there to assume that you know it is an individual\nWho may not have been asked sophisticated but certainly with sophisticated enough to do a coordinated attack across a number of different locations more or less simultaneously\nAnd you're right we're we're thankful no mail handlers of gotten blown up and first responders and we don't know how many how many are live\nAt this point it is a real there with the intel community about how much information they give out our we intentionally not hearing weather all the choices are hot and they will keep most of the info or to themselves because they don't want to tip their hand or do they let stuff out\nIntentionally use your message to the mail and somehow you release info to try and drop\nOr course somebody into getting sloppy so they can catch them\nWell I Would never second guess the FBI I'm a very big fan of the euro and they have put out a one eight hundred call FBI\nTips line if anyone has seen one of those packages or has any information um maybe they were working someplace like you said and someone came in and bought all these forever stamps or bought a whole bunch of these manila envelopes\nSo I think that the FBI sometimes doesn't release a lot of information because that's how they can sort through the tips because lots of people and start calling it tips line and not everybody actually has actual information some people just call the ...\nRight and then they have to run over those that are also there's always a circle of influence around the perpetrator people family friends who may not know but as they start to become aware come forward is that what happens in the majority of the cases where does that entail DNA is sort of the characters most of these people\nWell we have a very good example of Ted Kaczynski where his brother and sister in law\nRecognize the language in the manifesto and came forward we also know that in something like Seventy one percent of the cases of loan actor terrorists they have revealed very significant elements of the plot to friends and family and coworkers and so there is a huge bystander effect\nA what we call leakage criminology so it is possible that\nYou know somebody who's bragging they go to the bar they get drunk they start talking about elements of the plot so you never know or some of the Senate formation is going to come from\nBut we do have to encourage people if you you know as we always say if you see something say something\nPlease say something you're better off saying something and not worrying about the ramifications of who's going to get in trouble and the fact is if we can prevent any kind of an injury or casualties this is our first priority\nAbsolutely and and again a tip helps but these guys are running down so many reasons so much manpower\nFor his facial recognition were we thinking this is the point where they can actually use it to compare as it is it that good\nI think it varies from what I remember hearing about some of the facial recognition technology and cc TV that the British were using and this was especially useful during seven seven and then we saw it again during the Boston Marathon bombing it's relatively sophisticated as well as a\nWitch CCTV and I think as much as sixty five Seventy percent of New York is covered with cameras whether their speed cameras or other kinds of cameras are like you were mentioning a shops to prevent theft and\nParking lots in all different locations there's cameras once you can start coordinating you can set up a timeline and follow individuals but I\nYou know part of it is that there is an overwhelming amount of data that right now the NYPD the joint terrorism task force and the FBI or having to sort through so again that takes a little bit of time as it did with the Boston Marathon bombing but as you saw they very quickly we're able to\nTriangulate the information and figure out that it was the ... brothers who had\nUh planted the bomb at the marathon\nYou know to a novice are looking or go so why wouldn't be traced ruptured the packages and delivery to determine if there's evidence showing subject mailing the packages that would seem to be the easiest thing assuming that the subject did Miller package or somebody mailed them for him or her\nSo the one that was mailed to um Delaware I my guess is that that is going to be traceable there's going to be because the moment you bring something to the post office right when it's a package you have to fill out information you have to give your name\nThere there's going to be codes\nOn those stamps to show which post office it was sent from but keep in mind again depending how sophisticated the bomber or bombers are or someone like Ted Kaczynski spent three days on a\nBus from Montana to San Francisco to mail those packages with in San Francisco when he was sending his mail bombs so that that isn't always necessarily going to be a direct correlation between where it was sent away that person is located\nProgram here Blum professor of communication at Georgetown University and also author of several books on terrorism we're looking at this and again it doesn't work to be\nUm are high and personal use of the misspellings okay a sophisticated person yet\nI see that there were say they can look at them I Do your bombs nomenclature to determine if there's a unique signature when somebody who is sophisticated noticed ... somebody else's signature and throw people off isn't it isn't an easy thing to do or this or not even enter into people's psyche when they're making a bomb we've never seen that before\nA lot of it is trial and error when I spent time doing research in Northern Ireland I talked to a lot of people who've been in the IRA as well as people who've been in the R U C which were the police at the time\nUh clamping down on Iran activities and they didn't realize about the forensics the bomb making elements H ... people started getting caught so again a lot of it was trial and error or the IRA bomb makers started wearing gloves but when they started wearing gloves that were less there were less able to make\nVery finely tuned bombs and so they'd have to take off the gloves so again a lot of it is trial and error with real bombs and not just if these are in some ways effigy bombs intended to cause panic and so fear\nIn real bombs very often you can tell the bomb maker because that person doesn't have all ten fingers records so much of the trial and error\nBut there are unfortunately lots of instructions on the Internet or an especially on the dark Web so this material unfortunately is out\nThere and depending on whether they were using an acid Tony base or the floor base or whatever kind of material to make the bomb actually explode you're going to have variation\nIn how sophisticated as\nWe're just talking to you and and hearing or excuse makes me feel better that they're going to mail whoever this is pretty quickly before we go can I ask you something more organic something about your watching this now how do you feel what is what is how does resonate with you knowing everything's roaming around your head your expertise the things you've seen the things we've studied\nIs there something this this bugging you something that's popping out of you\nI think the thing that bothers me most and concerns been we've been talking about this in public for uh just had a\nChair a counterterrorism meeting in New York last week in which show they were members of a former members of the NYPD as well as experts on terrorism of all different stripes we've had a an unfortunate focused on one kind of terrorism the jihadi terrorism coming out of the middle\nIt's an almost complete ignoring of extreme right wing terrorism and I think that uh we used to be prepared for the eventuality in reality that these threats are going to beat domestic homegrown threat coming from the extreme right wing and not coming from jihadi terrorism is because there's been a deliberate\nBlindness willful blindness looking at these groups in part because um there's a perception that these

possibly the last movie involving blackface\nOr which was crippling door strive with Richard Dreyfuss um my manager asked me to be in the movie to play a TV personality and I didn't know what the movie was about and I read my size my lines and I was happy to be in the movie because I don't get asked to be in movies like\nAnd what the premise of the movie as Richard Dreyfuss trying to remember if his wife had passed away but I think so\nHis wife passed away and he was raising the kids alone and he's a professor\nAnd he was panicked because they were going to yank his credentials because he had talked about this tribe that he had found\nThat um no one ever seen before or heard of before uh in in the deepest darkest or parts of the Nile wherever and because we're going to yank it he decided with his family to recreate\nVideos of that tried so the entire family dressed as tribal members and they shot the movie in his backyard and it looked like they were doing all kinds of stuff they were doing um a worshipping or by doing the sacrifice to animal sacrifices\nAnd the movie it was supposed to be sweet and it was supposed to be touching in the sense that even though he lied\nOr it brought the family for the first time closer together to kids participated with him and he's sitting there on my TV show in total tribal makeup and I\nAm in interviewing him\nUm and I remember him looking at me Richard going\nMan I don't know that there's enough money for me to do this and I said apparently there is a but maybe part of it was because he was playing it was a comedy on who's playing a ... tribal chief of men there was not a lot of controversy around it I think major the major reason there was not a lot of controversy around it is 'cause no one saw the movie\nSo I'm I save you time and money if you're going to rent crippling door strive as you said come up\nI'm In it but it's not a very good movie but at any rate making Kelly she's off the air today\nUm rumor is that
