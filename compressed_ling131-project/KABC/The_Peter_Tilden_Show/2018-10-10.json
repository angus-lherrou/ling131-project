and all I I you know I said\nLeave that race and serve\nReally been a blessing and I want to thank you for that\nNikki Haley was indeed a bad asked in her job as the UN ambassador she basically spent every day going and yelling a despot which was great at it I mean she would go in and she would talk about how the United states was exceptional and America was unique place in our allies like Israel ... supporting and how the u._s.\nIt was basically the most eyes Lee of the international institutional sort of lay out and she was exactly correct about all those things I Will miss Nikki Haley

know there have been a bunch of rumors about what's going to happen next people suggesting that Nikki Haley is going to take Senator Lindsey Graham spot Lindsey Graham is going to become the the UN ambassador that's not going to happen I'm just going to say that right here right now Lindsey Graham has no interest in giving up a tendency to go to the UN ambassador it\nWould be a great solution it'd be really Machiavellian to move her into the Senate where she could just do battle with Kamala Harris on a daily basis it would be spectacular I Would enjoy watching it and Lindsey Graham would actually make a terrific UN ambassador because it would be full time Lindsey Graham to point out that's all that he would do all day long it would be Lindsey Graham two point oh and just yell at people should be\nAmazing but unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen there are some rumors and maybe it'll be Dina Powell who was a former member of the administration\nOr or maybe it'll be ... we're now who would be terrific he's our at current ambassador to Germany I really doubt that they are going to call him back from Germany to make him UN ambassador there are few other possibilities Nikki Haley is is not going to stay with the administration now she's out she is not going back to the Senate\nMy guess is that she is going to go back into politics maybe a couple of years from now but I get the sense from her from from folks you know her that she actually does just want to take some time out that she sort of been burned out on his job and I hear I mean that's that's a pretty brutal job and I met with ambassador Haley just a few months back\nAnd it's not the easiest job in the world going in there every day is number one having to watch what the administration is saying and doing and number two having to go in with some of the worst people on earth and tried to negotiate with them on a regular basis so good for Nikki Haley and she certainly has\nAll sorts of gratitude from folks like me for everything that you did I'm very sad indeed to see her the meanwhile\nThe United nations put out a report and this is getting all sorts of press on

Peter here by the governor of oh sure\nYeah that's so you know what our beaches are like I tell people have been doing this all day all over the country and I tell people if they want to know what our Sanders like here are beach go to your pantry and take out your ... your sugar and port in a in a in a large bowl that's the color of are saying it's absolutely gorgeous white\nSo uh uh this uh area has become a tourist attraction in the last ten years like like now the other one of the top beaches in the world so this is going to change that landscape and that's going to have a devastating effect on the economy without a doubt\nThe other part of this I mean I didn't want to jump to that yet because it's just making them seeing on CNN they got the decision making landfall but you look at the repercussions for this they're saying power can be a a for months be\nThe economy the cost the cost of this in in lives and the economy is huge and then another thing as a as a as just kind of more subdued actual but the election the November sixth election\nIs going to be impacted by this and it's\nInteresting because I'm looking at who's running and he got the mayor of Tallahassee who's the nominee for governor and you've got a represent around the senators are as\nGovernor so there again Rick Scott and there\nAnd they got ripped out running or a for\nA set it against you got these ad campaigns going back and forth where they're jacking each other and\nIn this kind of situation you have to do with whom by after reach across the aisle and say we got to get together and do whatever needs to be done but you remember Chris Christie\nThe tar and hugging Obama and were that went out or after the or the hurricane Sandy so that politics is going to play the economy they don't there is in play 'em at the most importantly people's lives and health he was black yeah and yeah and you know\nEight or ... you know I I I I Do mainly uh it'll just sports beat uh but uh I'm an American\nAnd I believe in what our country stands for and you know it comes to a point where these guys have got to get their act together and start working with each other because it's it ... if you can work together you're never going to come to an agreement\nWhat one way or another so and this is exactly what we're having here with this storm I mean this is a lot of political situation at all about the people that live here and the people that make this area you know ... ... ...\n... and you had to sentence and criticizing or dealing with the two years ago with like is what was it for mine my yeah absolutely so it'll be a test or\nIn in this divided country it'd be tough to see how these politicians coming up to a mid term election work with each other because boy you guys are going to need all of the help you can get on any new updates on the storm for you since you're down there that you're hearing\nA daily update is that it's it's it's actually the the eye wall is sixty miles wide which is absolutely you know that's why I wall so it'll set a a from the center it'll it'll affect thirty out on each side which\nYou know when you're talking to a hundred and fifty five hundred and sixty ... ah you're not just talking a small area now you're talking you know a huge area that's got to get this and like you said earlier I was just gets up in the south Alabama south Georgia the Carolinas\nA deadly tornadoes start now you're going to see even more damage\nJoe and it's a it's it's one of its first of all its nature we talk about that\nIn any parts of global warming how this is talk of weather but once again you know we live on the Gulf Coast much like you all live in Los Angeles and um I I Will tell you that that my wife was poetry or race to Cal State Fullerton but when you all have fires earthquakes or right with\nYou I absolutely Idaho and and there's some how can\nYou David you're putting a face to it I was going to ask because again this area's been through this before in construction of your home down there I Know a in North across in South Carolina on the coast there they have rods metal rods that go through to hold the roof on they raise or how they start building second story up the\nGuy I Know in Florida have the storm shutters the whole bit what are you where do you have in your house that will protect you from a hundred and forty mile an hour winds\nWell here's the deal when you are if you're an older home that was built before hurricane oval and if you remember ...\nThat was twice a year ago even either okay through they passed a law the state of Florida that if you build a new house or you build a new building\nAnything you've built from the ground or you replace your windows in your oh they have to be hurricane rate it would change in excess of a hundred and forty mile an hour which\nI Can't even imagine that I we live in a well\nWell that's just you know here's the other thing that they didn't which they should have done is that all of the power and you build a new subdivision in the state of Florida all the powers underground colonel power\nWhich makes sense yeah what a great cost\nBut again you have a lot of low lying areas too so when flooding stored in man it it's it's just a double whammy\nYeah these days it if if if you look at the ... like a settled in the bay area the water is so shallow it goes it goes out almost fifty sixty miles into the Gulf and it's only three feet deep\nRight you can walk sixty miles out without electric go in that area it it it gets\nAbove your age so anyway what and that's not good because you know stop this wall of water rushing Eddie ... all the ... the soil\nWill look I Wish you luck will be thinking about you all day we'll check in with you later I'm In for sure tomorrow and hanging I Hope that you you whether safely and our thanks to thanks to stay in and doing the reporting is important and you ... you're right we're all connected in it and when a tragedy happens in or wherever it happens\nUm we all have to help that we don't have to pull together so I Wish you and the folks down their luck and we will check and later on\nThey appear to be safe men you take care of yourself or David ...\nIs a using in Destin, Florida as you heard in his house um and he was going to weather the storm because this guy is sports guy but um he's he was nice enough to

if I were to ask you this question is a big question number Ella question is what do you\nWant to LA to look like we talk every day about the changing LA we see the fact that they're doing road diets and they're doing bike lanes everywhere and they are building light rail\nUm we have a line that's going right through your Culver City that goes all the way to Santa Monica um and we see the density projects that are being built we see on Las ... where are all building was I just went by there the other day it's stunning we had a building there that I guess how Stevie what like two hundred people that when we were in the building over there in Lausanne may be right\nUm and it would take us about five minutes to get out on philosophy and ... and to turn right near sees candy um what they are building now is mixed use so there's going to be stores above that they're going to be offices and above that there's going to be residences so\nWe're ... was backed up before when that project is done maybe two to three\nSounds and people going in and out of there and I don't know who's not going to widen the highway they're not going to widen the road I don't know how they're going to prevent MSN again from backing up the ten freeway to set never at that point it's going to be so congested in that area\nSo now I'm looking at state senator Scott winner he's the one who wants to be a twenty seven which was a allowing density heighten restrictions to be lifted in neighborhoods where you have a single family dwellings um if it's within a half a mile of a transit hub and a transit hub my understanding was\nIt can be were to bus routes intersect ... which means okay let's\nWave the requirement and we can build up\nEight stories there because we need more housing here in Los Angeles\nThe question is is that can help with affordable housing or just because you're near a transit all but I mean when they build on Las ... next to the transit up there\nAre those units going to be affordable or you're gonna have a two bedroom for seven thousand a thousand ten thousand dollars and you're going to have a family of four and you're gonna have to be um WC when it could turn sixteen is going to have his first Toyota Prius and they're going to come marching up\nNot using the rail is right next door it well the SBA twenty seven never got through with Scott Wiener is introducing a new version of the Senate or a twenty seven which was it's it's contested I mean people don't want density\nBut most of LA is single single houses I mean those neighborhoods are going to change the texture nature those neighborhoods tank he fell to get enough votes to advance out of the transportation committee last time\nBut he's now talking to some of the groups that oppose that um because he said you need the housing and he's made some adjustments to it or he but he just went out there for for all all California cities\nOver Ninety seven percent of them have not met their state mandated housing requirements on this is my favorite part by the way of this story\nA councilmember Paul corrects or on the initial bill said the bill would make LA looked like Dubai ten years later although wiener\nSaid when you talk to correct Slater about his comments correct admitted to him that he hadn't read the bill at that point and had assumed that there was no height restriction doesn't that make you you were talking about density we're talking about a change to the city\nWe're talking about hearing opposing viewpoint you're talking about details I guess this thing was too long to read but corrupt commented on it before reading it and didn't understand what was in it that's my man I'm he said when my staff and later I read the bill and later I read it because I like comedy first\nThat's I get in the morning and I commented things and then if I get time I read about it and be informed later so he actually said when my staff leader red red red ... it was big enough than an first blush we thought it might be unlimited height said corrects\nGood question but that's easy Charles they're gonna start taxing the rent if you ... the tax rain anything where there's run off

through the roof my taxes are going to increase astronomically which is not true and if you're kind of liberal and democratic and you really hate what just happened with the Supreme Court hearings you may say yeah I'm going to vote for Medicare for all\nBecause that's going to solve all of our problem is when\nYou know it it might um it it many countries use a kind of single payer Medicare for all program very successfully\nBut it's not the only way and it may not be our way um because it comes with a certain implications for incomes for an industry which is not likely going to sit down and and and\nTake a a revenue reduction slightly so I think um you know I'm hoping by the twenty twenty election we're going to have to hear much more clarity on what the two sides really mean because you know we saw that the Republicans got into trouble with is when they were like\nOh repeal and replace repeal and replace it everyone voted for it on the Republican side because they didn't like

it's true that for a very elective things in Canada you can wait Twenty one months but I'm also sure it's true that if you need a car a coronary bypass\nOr stent you don't wait at all and I I you know when people try and is on the Canadian system and I'm not saying that's where we should go to war that the ideal but I like to point out that the Canadians by and large are extremely happy with their health care which Americans are not and\nIn polls when the the Canadian Broadcasting company asked who is the most important Canadian and history it was a guy who now American has heard of whose name taught me Douglas who was the person who implemented candidates\nNational health plan so you know uh I think there's so much information and of course Medicare for all would would require incredibly high taxes if we pay the price has we're paying now for healthcare but of course if there was a Medicare for all system\nMedicare or national single payer would have a huge negotiating power so we wouldn't be paying those high prices\nRose or we could do that now if we could import from other countries medicines we could do a lot of stuff ... off\nThe lobby or ... how many people wrote to help your ... ... people were involved in Obamacare and he said for every politician regardless one probably Fifteen to twenty lobbyist minimal down soda to pharmacy who you insurance\nTo cigarettes to on and on and on and they're all in they were getting their peace and they're all putting these guys in office so these guys are listening and they're letting them right to health care bill Obamacare was written by ... so where are we now have we ... we moved the ball at all in our favor to help us with health care costs\nWell I think if we want to say we moved the ball it's that states are doing a lot of laws like protecting people from surprise medical bills they're\nDoing some laws trying to control drug pricing but of course for the state can do on its own is much more limited than what the federal government can do and I think what we need to look at these are representatives on both sides of the aisle and say\nYeah you know like President Trump said\nA ... you know the the drug companies are getting away with murder we're going to bring down prices for every ... there was a recent study and that for every one price reduction\nThere were eighty six price hikes this year so you know I think we've got to say to all of these people on both sides of the aisle and the same thing happens on the Democratic side anyone who says oh don't worry we're going to solve this all single payer\nOkay how are you going to do it who's feet are you going to hold to the fire because I can tell you anything that brings down medical costs which is what we all want on both sides of the aisle is getting a made a made a serious production and income for some business and some lobbyists\nAnd so what we need now is not ideas we have plenty of ideas about how to to bring down prices\nAnd I'm agnostic you know it could be a single payer it could be some kind of price regulation it could be breaking up hospitals can glamour that can be allowing importation of drugs\nThere are ... million ideas out there that would work we have to choose which we're going to do and our politicians have to have this fine to move forward on them despite what a you know the industry of health care wants\nAnd we don't know where ... in conditions aren't depends on who you call with this one I don't anything can be a preexisting condition ...\nWell and that's the problem when people say oh you know a ... the problem was basically that before there was Obamacare So if you take that away there were some it's in the theoretical protections for people with preexisting conditions under the hip act\nUm but those weren't working very well because insurers to find everything and anything as a pre existing condition right so if I had you know\nA a distant history of depression oh we're not going to insure you for a reasonable price because you might get depressed\nAgain or were you there the reason that we are depressed [laughter] they're confused and and a whole a whole bunch of other\nThings so I think you know I'm a pre existing conditions is a great thing to run on everyone wants people with preexisting conditions covered\nBut what kind of guarantees you provide isn't just about what the law says because uh the laws are manipulated by the healthcare industry for profit so if you give him a loop hole which even well written laws do they will use it\nSo it's a matter of buying then we're dissolve on what you're going to do how you're going to enforce those laws problems\nIs so complicated that you don't know what to march march of the Capitol Steps with the sun you don't even know what you want to sign\nBecause again if they're beholden to these companies and they're not going to negotiate prices and they're going to let the pharmacy and and the insurance industry run this whole deal than were spinning your wheels on me I'm looking at the you know who helps losing those reforms dinner was aware and had an emergency gall bladder surgery that they should\nOr was not to be paid for because he didn't get prior approval for an emergency gall bladder surgery I had a son who had an emergency and critical an ambulance\nUm they said it wasn't an emergency I'd rather go into specifically what is the trust me it was a major emergency wouldn't fighting not for six months and and everyone out there just listen to my horse has that same story you shouldn't be then impossible\nBut I think what the science shouldn't need to say and what what we as voters they to say is put patients first you know health care is about patients not about business and I think that was the theme of my book that we've let a business hijack our health care and we put business considerations before health and\nWhatever kind of system we go to it has to have patience put first and look we have you know everyone has a bill at this point that that's outrageous I think everyone in this country\nSo um we all should be attuned to what what are are solutions that we shouldn't think of it as a right wing or left wing issue it's an every one issue and I think you know we have this wonderful series which is\nTragic in a way called beloved a month where everyone monthly dissect readers bill and it's it's a you know it's one of her story after another and if you know many of them the states are trying to act on state attorney generals or take action but we'll eat the answers we need federal action\nYeah and I don't know if we're going to have the guts to do it and I I just I recall when I hear somebody go single payer I wouldn't do that that's awful or on the other side and I go we don't even know what you're talking about it's just it's a bullet points that immediately recalled because your team is pushing something\nAnd yet we're all taking a short while we're fighting each other and being distracted before you go because the book is starting\nTo give us something actionable we talked about coating before I told you because of you I Want it would have loved to send my kid who's the coding school where they could learn to do the codes there on your bills because their huge money there and you point out if you go to the doctor's office and us for one thing or medicine or a brand new to go to another code\nSo all of a sudden your bill goes up and people have no idea\nIf they're single hospital group or an individual doctors that makes a difference so what can you give is actionable today that people could could possibly do to bring down their bill\nThe first thing I tell people is don't jets write the check [laughter] you know often I I just saw bill this morning where someone was told us he owed twenty thousand dollars and it just said services will say what you would do in every other aspect of your life you know what is it forward tell me exactly what I'm paying for\nAnd then for bills that don't make sense there are many really\nGood laws including including in California I'm about surprise medical bills now that the hospital when they send you a bill that isn't a like an out of network bill or for an ambulance ride that you didn't know you were going to have\nTo pay 'em they're not going to tell you we have a PS there's a state law so you may not have to pay it\nLooking at an end soliciting for innovative ideas to house the homeless after they have this billion dollars for what a year and a

report you read is that these folks don't talk to each other and the different entities don't talk to each other they don't communicate\nUm and then they're not sharing information about cost and about what would be what would be suitable to do that and again the fact that we're into this and going maybe you should be for people in a union center one really we we just it just came up with that
