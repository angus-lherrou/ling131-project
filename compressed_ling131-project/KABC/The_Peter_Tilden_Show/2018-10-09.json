Administration\nWhat you don't usually whatever so much more time with their family means that there was a scandal about to break\nUp if I ever go to the politics and leave I'm going to say I want to spend more time with that person's family because I like them much better than mine a and\nA lot of the ... you could say I'm going to spend more time with the children I had to get there you go\nUm yeah just boy as watching it and everybody's all smiles I mean I got a listen listen to the Bronx is going to be out and I just wanted to let you know so at the end of the navy will be leaving in part was complements\nPain that on our on here that are going to ask about twenty twenty now I'm not running for twenty\nI can see why are we going to find out how to pointing\nHugs and kisses do you believe all of that or again is there some below the surface\nYou know I I think that you know she's a very ... and she may be allowing for the chance that he might not running for reelection it's it's certainly not a foregone conclusion\nThat we know what's going to have a clear and if he does not run she is geared herself with the Trump people by his war and more toward her by their their loyalty there but like some other people who might go go against it so she could have the Trump they\nAlso have a lot of women a lot of people basically drawn to her\nSubstantive knowledge of each with cheese conduct yourself you would have after by not simply shooting from the from the hip but she's studied up on the issues as far as the Russia situation you could see that what she has ventured out foreign policy he has been proven correct what you talked about the steak\nA repeal jerk but then she found that the sanctions what it moving forward\nYeah she's a shrewd and look she's she's taken over the news like when you look at least CNN and Fox yet she's going to be her day to day and the headline is both ... and Pompeo caught off guard\nRight and and meanwhile you know CNN will spend the whole day trying to look for a a a plot or or find something something wrong there which has become sadly characteristic of of of of see it as a CNN\nYeah I was saying to to somebody the other day I see other stories I mean the stories of the even if you like the story there on the show is the world man\nYou know people would be shocked at Turner who who was really ... the director of CNN a ... you know what it was formed for your actually was a bit on the conservative side and during that time seeing with the cable news network leading news it's now commentary\nAnd it's all it's like what somebody said about what somebody said instead of what's going on a let's move on to a cabin okay Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed and then he was sworn in as he was sworn in the person's getting some pushback\nOn the ... that he really wouldn't sized the selection during this where It's MORNING and apologizing strongly agree and I was bringing upon a time and even during the pollen count on Fox and kind of out what you're doing ... coordinated cocktails and abandoned the\nWhole idea reflects to air is one is just a lack of of graciousness you don't want to be a sore winter and the second thing is with the Supreme Court you want to cut her we elevated up above the earth and and even if you are supportive of Kavanaugh as I was\nA ... and and I blame fights and all these people for degrading the process but no matter what your view is if you have an opposite he this was a time to have a very civil traditional swearing in kind of ceremony without gloating\nSo that said I'm trying to figure out because I don't trust polling at this point\nWith the midterms are going to look like and I keep reading stories than say the GOP basins energize because of the demon demographic who went on and on the other side the other side Ronald you hear that the Democrats are motivated because they took it in his shorts as far as the ... who's motivated by this and we have\nTo go over simplification because the statement that that you just added which which echoes the conventional wisdom of doors to growing a independent vote\nVoters who declined to affiliate with the Democratic party or the Republican Party here in California it's it's ever larger there\nAnd these are the ones that have posed a great challenge to to candidate Trump President Trump so ... you know it isn't simply how much each base stuff in the independent voters tend to be left energized less motivated to have a lower professor turned out to vote but enough do turn out to vote and that's gonna really be the the the key here\nAnd ... and and how do we know that and then enter millennials in the mix and then they see this gender gap and you don't want to vote in ...\nAnd ... what makes you properly skeptical the polling is that most of the public we done polls won't spend the money to ethically leisure voter turnout protesting you can't measure it by one question which is are you going to vote because most people lie the voters route would be nearly a hundred percent you have to have\nIt's kinda like when you go to the atomic trust they cast your vision of kids do you see it this way this way that way there so you need a series of questions they don't want to spend the money to ask people questions like you know whether the election is how important it is and then you have a kind of a computer aggregate all the things that come up with a voter protesting\nAnd the other variable here and ... another reason why what has to be skeptical is a growing number of people are voting in advance of the election right and so once somebody votes and this is a pathology it's a hundred percent voted for ... if they voted they have a hundred percent chance of voter turnout\nSo you'd have to find poli that takes the consideration as you get closer to close the electric people who you can somehow verify has voted get their view in fact are those in\nSo do you sense that the president has ticked off female voters 'cause they keep talking about this gender gap for female voters I'm pushing back on the me too movement is that going to motivate women to come out and vote\nThe question is whether he has a caused a problem with female voters he otherwise would have as opposed to simply making right female leftist in liberal democratic women more upset that they wore and maybe increasing they're likely to voting somewhat and also at the same thing is he going to turn out\nThere lots of Republican women who have a very very different view of this and they're independent women who kind of go both ways on this and there are a whole bunch of men who maybe voted voted to turn out for his candidate\nWho you know so your answer is it's it's ... years\nNo way to know without people spending a bunch of serious money on point other than saying are you gonna vote for Smith or Jones\nYeah I'm Glad you said that because I'm looking at this thing could have and I was going to motivate the he's in he's going to motivate the GOP based 'cause they're demonizing will one argument\nWas that he didn't get into it motivate the base and make them matter what the question is it is it that not the question nobody really knows\nI think you're right I think you're absolutely right which is why I ask you questions like you to figure out reading ... pointed out\nQuite correctly that it could affect the Senate differently than the house that if we think of the Senate seats firming up toward Republicans which at that holds means that Republicans\nMay gain one or two or three seats the Senate but the house seats may have a different effect but here's another thing is it just may be too sophisticated for somebody lizards or may not when you see that generic voting saying what percentage of people say I'm likely to vote for a Democrat for Congress versus I'd like to vote for Republican for Congress people interpret that\nTo him for who's going to uh gain seats or lose seats but remember that national number so a state like California that has a large share of the national vote eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen\nPercent or whatever just to California that's going to those national numbers there but the fact is that you have a whole bunch of seats here in California that are wildly democratic or many of them have a large number of African American voters who tend to be democratic\nHispanic Latino voters that was your finger to the number what really matters individual districts\nAnd I agree the other thing before we go because when we have moments in them jumping around a topics but Bill Murray knowing Hillary are going on a tour they're going to do a city I think it's I forget which promoter his book them to do a ten\nEvents out their timing timing thinking don't you realize that they can motivate the base to demonize you 'cause now you're giving interviews again she already gave an interview yesterday on the Supreme Court\nAnd in the ... ... how they has been politicized and how what Trump is doing wrong and sent her doesn't that just put her in front of the public again to remind people oh yeah that's what we're voting against it it just doesn't west\nFor perennial redemption at a personal level that in the past is conflicted with democratic objective after the election the Democrat Party wanted to go away and then they'll always brings back the me too little bit from that standpoint\nRight there is no upside to this accepted their ... their ego and their their touring again for whatever reason they have to be out there it's really bizarre that they can't just\nNobody can say hey now would not be a good time moving on to Rosen's things interesting that he flew with Rosenstein yesterday and said things are great I took that as long as he knows everything the mullahs doing these he's head of the investigation\nHe fires Rosenstein now that may not be the best eight objects and B you want him out their rogue you don't know what's gonna happen you\nKnow once I heard that he was ... more frequent flyer miles an air force one\nYou know light conclusion was he was going to be fired because President Trump to show that with the various people have been fired he has never fired anybody it's always been the chief of staff it's a ... or somebody else\nSo despite the TV show The Apprentice where he says you're fired there it doesn't usually happen in person the one exception was out there was a flight with his chief of staff\nOr rent rent free bus and he got off the plane to discover he was no longer\nChief of staff that was the only right [laughter] your car doesn't work anymore at that point um Trump is flying around on doing rallies is does this help helping uh in in the midterm elections we're just not expanding the base instance hitting the base again just trying to energize people were already in\nI think unless it's it's customizing tailor it to a specific state or it may make a difference at the margin and the other point is it always runs the risk that he steps on his own show his own foot there in in the show so he may upstaged\nThe NBC News alive

water supposedly that they're going to be capturing so it's just another one of those trust us with the money just like the homeless billion dollars we'll figure it out wink wink nod nod 'cause that's what we do\nSo over the last four years we've approve bonds that will allow the state to issue over twenty billion dollars of debt and the average the average to pay off those the caring cross or one point two billion a year for the next Thirty years so remember you're\nLaying on top of that all of these commitments that we have so it's one point two billion in twenty twenty\nThe state is expected to place on the ballot to profs there will raise our taxes by an estimated twenty billion\nA included is something I mentioned the other day the split role which would amend prop Thirteen remember yesterday we heard the um the debate or conversation between the two men running for governor and um\nI'm prop Thirteen was mentioned and you guys called and said man if they touch prop Thirteen well this is going to allow county assess ers to value commercial properties that market value as opposed to what we're doing now which is lying on the purchase price that's supposed to raise about ten billion dollars the legislature is also proposing\nA sales tax on services provided by accountants lawyers in any other professional that's another ten billion dollars in Sacramento\nThey're looking at to bond offerings of five billion ... billion for the University of California and three billion to finance the deferred maintenance on the state's neglected parks that in your can cost is estimated to be about three hundred and twenty five million over the next Thirty years that we're paying off\nIn addition to the cap and trade program and the revenues there which is devoted to a good portion of our voted to the bullet train of course and according\nTo the legislative analysts office cap and trade will add about twenty four to Seventy three cents to the cost of a gallon gasoline so it's going to cost drivers about\nTwo point five to seven point five billion or he calls he's a split the difference call it five billion okay uh LA USD is looking at a six hundred and ten dollar parcel tax but the twenty twenty ballot\nBut the uh LA LA us the\nThe they're looking at this thing and it's union believes that they can they can do this and that they have the right to do this the city of Los Angeles is looking at a measure to raise four billion in debt to finance and repair and maintain our streets of course have been neglected that's gonna be the bonds about two hundred and fifty million dollars a year\nYou got to south coast air quality management district is considering a three hundred million dollar vehicle licensing fee to finance smog reduction programs\nUm and the county that is telling us from one point two billion over the last couple of years okay that's been the tax increases that they've added so they're also looking now uh for the increase to ... contributions any way they can to cover the pensions and the increase salaries so\nOver the last two years our share of what we've been paying a new taxes ready as two point four billion dollars that works out and I'm Glad he broke it down per person and per household over the last two years for our share of new taxes at two point four billion is about six hundred dollars a person\nOr twenty four hundred dollars for a family for which is like bumping the sales tax up to Thirteen percent or increasing our property taxes to forty five by forty five percent if we all approve the fourteen\nBillion in bonds like the three hundred million rain tax on all the other taxes and bonds that are being considered or what you're going to have is that would be a five point five billion dollar\nHit or fourteen hundred dollars a person or fifty six hundred for a family of four which he points out is like bumping the sales tax to Eighteen percent or doubling doubling your property taxes so it basically comes down if you say yes to all the increases in November\n... in addition to what we're already paying you're looking at Fort fourteen hundred person or fifty six hundred ... a family of four\nPer year and this doesn't include the cap and trade impact on gas prices so it's insane how much they're asking for as far as the county's rain tax was saying see no on if you read it like I said if you go deep\nAnd read on that it it's basically saying hey uh we'll figure this out of but if water runs off your roof and your driveway underneath your desk or we're\nGoing to charge you on that and then the authorization to fourteen billion in bonds which we're going to pay off and pay off and pay off a it's gonna it's gonna just take what you're paying in taxes through the roof and increase it by like I said in a significant number fifty six hundred dollars for a family for so what do you think\nAbout that when you actually break down the numbers and see what the equivalent is dino looks like he's crying Steve is in the fetal position I mean and they just keep asking for more and more and more they're not talking about pension reform they're not talking about\nWhat we're going to do specifically with the money that it can't be touched other things which is what they've done how many years now that we've lived that I've been here twenty three years um and they keep promising and promising promising and then they kickback money\nFrom the general fund from the D. W. P. by the way the D. W. P. has all these is over it's stuck to the general fund which is a back door tax\nSo its taxes taxes taxes pay off the bonds how many hunting work how many much more can they actually ask people to commit to and then at the same\nTime I'm looking at a they want to decide the government wants to interfere and decide what you should be able to rent your property for your houses for 'em and a lot of mom and pops out there who are struggling and they have a property that they're renting the government's going to come in and tell you how much you can increase not rent to or not increase that rented which is kind of insane\nSo and then we still have the homeless issue with Dr Drew was talking about yesterday as far as the illness and ah the ... and there's actually in San Francisco a guy came up with an app\nCalled ... and use the name I did not make this a snap crap\nIt's actually he said it's so hard to get the city to come out and they tend to um feces that are on the sidewalk there in parking garages that all over that he can snap grab you take a photo of it and it goes directly to the city\nSo that they can they can get the location it immediately puts in a location where it is a war you saw it and it allows people to take photographs and deliver an alert directly to the city public works department and it's a shame I have a friend who owns a property out here\nAnd it's a small apartment house and he said he has so many people going into his parking garage and death vacating there and being there and it's it's horrible it's it's a shame\nIt's a shame for them and it's it's a shame for us and\nIt takes a property values down and there's illness but you know what the city trying to come up with these innovative ideas to house homeless people or is is a shocker and I'll give you some context on that too because as citizens committee overseeing the spending of the one point two billion on homeless housing bond um is having a hell of a time trying to figure out\nHow to work with the city and be innovative and actually really make a difference in the homeless community so if you'd like to contribute to that conversation to your mind that your taxes could be going up fifty six hundred\nFifty six hundred dollars for a family of four is an ... sentencing amount of money and at the same time they keep asking for more and more money for the DMV which just found Fifteen hundred people\nAgain wrongly register to vote under the new motor voter system and that includes non citizens in addition to the twenty three thousand registration mistakes already disclosed by the DMV last month so you sit back\nAnd you look how the city's operating with a budget that's alive because it doesn't take into consideration all of the\nThe debt in the future that we have as far as the unions and now they keep asking and asking and asking and I'm scared that the homeless money the billion is going to be run through and they're not going to have anything to show for it so and of course they're they're moving fast because\nThey want to clean city up before the Olympics come because they don't want those optics of homeless people\nTaking dumps right in the middle of the street when the Olympics cameras are here so we've got some problems folks the DMV is a mess\nOr if they keep adding people but they don't do anything to the computer systems to upgrade the computer systems or doing it's slowly they're making so many mistakes as far as voter registration is twenty three hundred and twenty thousand plus Fifteen hundred um and they're asking for innovative ideas to house homeless people it after they've already taken the billion which\nIs another amazing example of let's ask for the money first and then we'll ... we'll kick it around and will figure out how to spend the money and what to do with the money it's like the road diets they didn't certain road diets\nAnd they didn't plan one step ahead they're not even playing chess or playing checkers where you go if I make that move not anticipating\nWhat the road die it's going to do is going to drive people from neighborhoods and make that risky and add the traffic deaths and pedestrians dust and and and a bicycle down so boy we don't have visionaries we just have people asking for money asking for money asking for money they're calling to raise money so that they can stay in\nFirst and then they move on were in debt and bingo I don't know where they're always going to look like in another ten Fifteen Years but it kind of is frustrating and scary which is why we have so many people leaving and why it's so hard to get around and went so hard for mom and pop businesses to stay open because\nThey have some kind of ... thank you very much I'll take all your calls what people want to talk about this because it is getting to be\nJust getting to be so expensive to live here and you're watching a diminishing services as you're paying more and more and more and and we're getting set up its its were there on their eight hundred to to find to to do Peter to attend continues recalls right after the next\n[noise] the NBC News of live and local eleven thirty I'm Rob
