living I'm blessed to be able to do this\nHowever many people think they can do this for a living that can just come in and talk on the radio and be a host and whatever and many have tried and many fail\nA my manager years ago big time guy handled Robin Williams first of all that he felt any convinced management here to fill in for me for a week he made it for the first hour and after he talked to all his friends on the phone he was he said I'm soaking wet under my arm pits 'cause I realize this it's not what you\nDo All right so I Do this you're doing your job ever it is well how many of you think reading\nThat you can do banking like a banker you think can get up in the morning with a three piece suit aren't going to sit behind a desk in an discern who to give alone to who not to give alone to how to vet it how to make sure that they come through if it's a business that's a start up\nIt's pretty tough in banking from what I understand there's not a whole lot of room for hours on that means or a banker\nHas about a one percent profit on assets\nThat's considered good okay so they have to make some really tough decisions when they do and do you think you can do that\nAnybody eight hundred or two to five to ... do you think you're just going to guess what somehow we're going to vote on a city banquet charter amendment B and we're supposed to believe that Paulk rats and all of these guys who do road diets who leave us was buckling sidewalks\nWho made a brilliant brilliant choice changing the trash trash removal that causes my looking on the decision they made they think that they can do another business outside of their business and they can do it well remember these are the people who bought buses they don't go up hills electric buses\nThat don't meet the range they're supposed to me\nBut they think they can open a bank and they can do it successfully compete with other banks\nUsed taxpayer money\nAnd not go but what what possibly could go could go wrong there if the council deciding on opening a bank so short amount of bees and about if it if it's approved\nIt wouldn't okay a city on bank but it begins the process where they can open a bank\nSo what could be good about this and a couple of articles have pointed this out\nThe could provide financial services to people who are under served\nIt could help support affordable housing could basically provide begging service over cannabis businesses who can't do banking right now because they can't use federally regulated banks because it's still not still not legal so that would be great except that\nPolitical influence you trust the guys at city hall not to turn this into a piggy\nBanks regret not only can they will they lose money not only will they think that emotional decisions but can you imagine the investigation after the bank opens about who got loans and all the political graft going on I mean it's it's a joke it really is a joke these people the decisions they may now they want to go into a business they know nothing about\nSo political influence I'm sure wouldn't wouldn't plan to this right to the bank would be operated independently so is the department of water and power operated independently how's that how does that work out so\nI'm Wondering if they can make the tough business decisions bankers don't make emotional decisions they make calculations based on investment return can you imagine these guys how they would make decisions\nAnd um if you're going to put social considerations or political consider variations in front of hey can I make money with that loan and the bankers that's all he cares about didn't care about your business he didn't care if it's fuzzier warm or whatever he wants to know what the returns are with the calculation is on last\nI can just imagine how much money we will lose\nOn a bank on a bank like that and by the way by supplying the cannabis business can you get FDIC insurance can you get the Federal Reserve system the process of your checks\nUm and they said the oversight by the way will be a commission of residents from each council district ... and they'll they'll take the place of experience bankers let's

east so that was his comment about\nOne guy's death Richard in Culver City we've got about a minute and a half year would you wanna say\nA he's an absolute monarch has any and so I think he has the right to kill anybody he wants to do in this country and the death occurred on us soil I don't condone it but I think that's their system he is the king\nWill ... yes they can do and they they continue to do all these human rights violations and lashing people interesting people and luring the princes in and jailing them so that he can keep his his power in his throne but the world's outraged that you can just remember a journalist who disagrees with you\nIn a uh even though it's yes even though it is and they're constantly that they send in a team of guys on jets to take you to take you out of a militia and do that\nBut I'm saying that's the way they play that's what they do Russia does the same thing here is that king he doesn't call themselves again the guy in North Korea he is a king it does the same\nBut that's why the administration with ... with the debt with Wall Street involved with the tech sector involved there's so many moving parts of this I really think that they do they want them to get an alibi\nThat is semi believe or when they can just of course they hope to move you hoping to move on and gives them cover so that they can say they didn't do it and

young of course the low humidity the national weather service had originally issued a fire whether watch for today and tomorrow but yesterday upgraded that to a red flag warning\nHis commitment to using floor time to to do something like that are all Ryan addressed as a little bit in a in\nAn interview yesterday and it was on CNBC um but so far the appetite for Republican leaders has been a little bit of a wait and see and I think what they're doing is they're sort of waiting for the Trump Administration and the president himself to come around and see that something needs to be done and we've seen an evolution in President Trump's language over the last few days\nGone from saying well this could have been you know anybody in ... killer to saying well yes he uh the junk shot he is is probably dead and that would have to be severe consequences now what those consequences are I'm not entirely certain but you know is America's wall standing worst a a an arms contract you live on a billion dollars\nBut he used to be careful too because he's weighing all of those things and if he goes out on a limb and says it wasn't them and then a tape is presented or they have definitive proof that can be an issue\nComing here ... and as a matter of fact there was one report last night or that a secretary of state Pompeo had\nAnd heard the tape that was a maid inside the Saudi consulate or the president just treated a few minutes ago that there was no tape and it's fake news and things like that so um this is a A N ... and evolving situation I think is the is the fairest way to\nPut it this is also involved because the ... the ... investigation as either winding down or it's not because anybody comes on says they know exactly where it is is full of it because no one knows but\nThey're looking at the finances obviously um and when the president claims he was no financial interests and yet everybody has a tape of the rally where he said that he gets fifty million from them and they they buy condos and you see the loans he's gotten from them and that you see that Jared Kushner potentially\nNeeds money to bail him out of his six six six Park Avenue place\nAre the scrutinizing now financial interests there and thinking that that may butt up against this conversation I Would be an uncomfortable conversation to have\nYeah it is not clear to me whether or not Saudi money and then the Saudi connections to President Trump or are involved in them our investigation at all however there have been reports that uh the ... investigation is looking into ties between the president and the UAE the United Arab Emirates\nA which is a very close Saudi ally or in the region and a and it sort of have become a the Saudis number two allies in in trying to counterbalance Iran and its influence in the middle east so\nThere there is some Middle East connection to them our investigation but as you say anybody who knows or anybody who says\nThey know it doesn't know any of that is is not is not telling you the truth what about the whisper\nCampaign that they're trying to mount that that I'm sure he was involved in the summer bin Laden and he wants he was a journalist and he was like a prized interview a and that he was part of the Muslim Brotherhood when he was a younger man it's it's not the sounds like not everybody is all in and they're kind of testing to see if they can make him a bit of a villain\nAnd this is this is shocking to me that the notion that ah somebody would ... would discount\nThe murder of an American resident I wasn't a citizen but he was a resident three of his four children are are American citizens are simply because of past associations uh I mean this goes down a real dangerous path but it's a another\nBit of evidence of of Trump's closest fans in Congress and Washington DC not trying to give him some cover or if he decides to stick with his original decision not to blame the Saudis and I was I was shocked to the other day when Pat Robertson set on television\nOr that that this this killing this murder said not jeopardize a hundred billion a hundred billion dollar arms sales and\nYeah we're just we're just commented on that before the top of the hour news 'cause it's it's [laughter]\nIt's amazing to see the point that you know amazing I'm OK on another ... ... ... the president's campaigning around the country\nFor mid term for candidates it doesn't seem as using a lot of the time these up their campaign in talking about the candidate in some places it it seems that he may be doesn't know that much about the candidate but\nLast night he went on his way to praise or the ... border um and my question about that is the great John forte who's the guy who body slammed the reporter\nHad lied about the reporter was asking question about health care the reports are that this gentleman then Greg Jim Ford they grabbed him by the throat body slam on the ground began punished or punish punching him\nAnd the way that came out as there was video and there was audio on so he ended and apologize had to pay a fine and gets to go to anger management the\nPresident he pleaded he pleaded guilty to a any pleaded guilty\nTo right okay so my question is\nThe president praising him and I played the clip I don't understand what he's thought was because number one right now they're trying to frame the Democrats as an angry mob when you do that it kind of knocks the legs out of your hey they're an angry mob because then Democrats and say really how about this\nSo that kind of new voters that\nAnd also with a journalist being assassinated potentially you're talking about violence to a journalist ... is that a plus is it a minus is it going to hurt him I in in the mix of polling\nI I Know it was his base because they were cheering him on a with the base obviously they didn't seem to mind but it's a big story today\nYeah and it it shocks me that ah I mean this is again what we're talking about look but President Trump is the one who's on the ballot this November even if his name is not going to show up he is\nSolely embrace that notion that a vote for a vote for any Republican candidate is a vote for his agenda um the fact that he goes on stage and he's supposed to ... and by the way\nLet me back up a little bit before I get too excited ... rally last night was supposed to be about a guy named Matt Rosendale those at Montana state auditor who's running for a U.S Senate seat against incumbent Senator Jon tester and Rosendale is actually a lot closer than I think a lot of people realize Montana is\nA no by no means a guinea for Democrats but the fact is\nThis is what we're talking about ... I mean this is another example of of the president as states are being so far off message and and going his own way that it ends up impacting his party I was looking at the uh the coverage and some of the Montana newspapers today and that\nThat comment about grades in four dead bodies planning a Republican is on the front page of a bunch of them so that tells you that ah that that ... that is the part of the methods that that through and that's not a good\nThing yes to that point read the presidents we regret messaging and he decides what the message you're going to be not necessarily party 'cause his party will decide on something and then he'll go out and decided to something else and he's decided now it's the caravan and immigration\nI'm at the the mob the Democratic mom and he's staying with that messaging does that seem to be resonating with with the voters\nI is first of all I Would challenge the premise that he's very good at messaging I I think that he's a he's a very good at his own brand I I think that the larger messaging is is a more difficult conversation\nWhen I say ... if you ask the average person where does the Democratic party's messaging right now or what's a Democrat naming Democrat given there must be being there or if you see the president he they say the wall and immigration or they say taxes it you know it's wages for middle class and it's America first they will repeat them because we don't repeat in them so often\nAnd so I don't I actually don't think that that's right I think I think what we see in the polling at the moment is there a few issues that have transcended and uh and you're right to focus on immigration that's one that is the one that that every Republican voter is is tuned into at the moment\nBut that number number one issue that the most important issue right now uh that voters are saying faces America is health care and that is the focus of the vast majority of a democratic advertising the Wesleyan Media project just came out with a new report on this yesterday or talking about the importance of uh of health care in the Democratic advertise\nAnd them and that tells me that you know there is some kind of democratic message that's that's breaking through and it may not be a as as\nPerfectly coherent as a build the wall because you know there are or what the four hundred and thirty five candidates running for U.S House seats were all a ad in your own little spin on the message but the fact is in health care has been the\nDominant conversation coming out of the Democratic side\nSo that there there is some message there\nAnd how Republicans dealing with that if ... if they if they see that it is about health care how will they play there\nYeah so they have I actually wrote about this earlier this week at the hell dot com a nice little self\nPlug that you do there is a I Am I'm learning Peter [laughter] ... what the what the Democrats\nAre doing is they're they're carrying in on the latest challenge to the Affordable CARE Act it's come out of Texas\nA Texas attorney general Ken Paxton file a lawsuit\nChallenging the validity the constitutionality of the AC eight and a and what the Democrats say that would do is end protections for preexisting conditions now that is like the single most popular part of a of the Affordable CARE Act and it's something that a lotta people are are deeply concerned about so you're seeing\nThese democratic ads talking about an end to create existing conditions\nA and Republicans are responding by talking about how important protecting preexisting conditions are to them we've seen that and you know Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin a Josh Hawley the Senate candidate in uh in uh Missouri as as the run an ad about that a quite a few others have to\nAnd that tells me that Republicans are just a little bit worried that this focus on preexisting conditions in protections for those who have preexisting conditions or could be a winning issue for Democrats in November you don't respond to a message that doesn't work\nYet read as we've done this and you visited with me many times between now and the midterms which are very close seven new stories could pop up that you ... the position of care I\nNeal inside the process to implement the legislation could take up to a year to state senator with a guest on mcentire in the morning ...
