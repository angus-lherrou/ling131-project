{"content": "You know Jet Blue which is which is a great airline for business travelers and leisure travelers and families grow at the airport as well I think internationally ... well there's an international\nThe other main objective I think we have is to see our our traditional long term partners\nYou know delta United American Southwest either go back into a lot of markets they used to serve here until the financial downturn you know several years ago ten years ago or so or we want them to bring back service a lot of their hubs or and increase the number of frequencies they have those hubs we likes to south west continue to grow but I think finally one major initiative for us is to\nBring in more international service you know China Airlines is really just the the first time I Will be many opportunities particularly in the Asia Pacific region I talked before about how\n... how you know most of the man come from areas closer to this airport than LAX\nAnd it's better for the region um is better you know for the travelers better for the economy if we can get to international gateway developed in this region takes pressure off of you know LAX which sits on the coast\nIt also takes pressure off of you know freeway congestion um it allows for a lot of good to be moved in and out of here more rapidly 'cause a lot of that air freight comes in on bellies a pass long haul pass you know wide body past year across the big the big plays we fly overseas\nRight there's a lot of clear opportunities and mainland China um you know Korea Japan the Philippines\nA but then you know also Europe or maybe not ten cities in Europe are probably four to five mhm anything that's really overall we want to do is identify this as\nYou know there's we're blessed to Southern California and have so many airport options whenever we want to travel somewhere but those options are limited at a number of the other airports so if you want to go anywhere in the world you really only have in terms of infrastructure to airports that can accommodate that and that silly accidents Ontario we want to establish Ontario as\nAs a viable alternative not we're not going to replace LAX but we can be that\nSecond international gateway that has a different kind of experience a different kind of feel maybe not flights as many places you have the deli acts but when you fly out of here\nIf we have a place where you want to go or connections that are attractive\nWe want to focus on you know very personalized exceptional memorable experiences you want to repeat again and again and again\nYou know it sounds like a perfect chat arrangement that writes factors for millennials they love to experience things you know last night we didn't focus group with a series of millennials\nI'm related to what you're looking for an\nEngagement on line and although it was an online conversation that within about seven minutes they talked about experience and they want to end it gives me want to be around other people they want to be treated as if they're special ... so important and we also know that they love flying you know the experience of flying and visiting other cultures\nSo those European cities make so much sense those Asians and he makes that makes sense\nAnd they also like the easy I think I'm an anti custody experience I'm I'm In an airport like Ontario sounds like you're really targeting that audience\nYeah you know and and the way we do that is [laughter] internally we've increased the the influence of millennials that organization we have a lot of young really smart actually um [noise]\nI Know the warm your heart I think they're almost all of women that are millennials committed their\nEye and social media right you're eating really emphasizing social media has a great way for people\nYup and the ... the most important thing we do is you know we asked for their opinions and we listened to him and and we let you know their contributions than an important one I mean there's a lot of things we share with him about the way you know [laughter]\nIt's silly ... and a lot of a lot of boomers that are that are hard core business travelers but you know I think they provide a lot of great insight and and have have really really a good knack an instinct for helping us market to you know to their to their cohort if you will demographic is\nHas right I Want you to be good for you to have a diverse snakes and to give them a voice I think two of them came out to meet with aspirin Aaron and we were so impressed with their\nA vibrancy they're talking about the branding and the positioning of the airport and they're great ideas around the holidays so not a really wonderful group of people\nA great personality and they've really embrace the brand and are helping to differentiate it which I think is so important that you can live with your social media I'm impressed with that I've also like to add the licensing deals and the co brandy agreements that you've created that I was at USC the other day and I actually saw a mention of Ontario airport can you tell us about that\nYeah I I don't as a as a as a loyal Trojan you're going to bring up at some point um yeah we're really excited about that agreement we uh just signed a three year agreement to be the preferred airport partner of USC athletic\nSo you know it it's not just the exposure that comes from the football games the basketball games and swimming turn all the Olympic sports that are you're sick so that\nIt's also really the the opportunity for us to connect with us the alumni network\nA and mark at the airport to them and have our brand you know I mean it started we like our brand to be tied to the USC brand there's probably not a stronger brand in terms of\nAthletics or or universities in academics in Southern California in terms of sheer volume of exposure but then I think internally having our airport be more aligned with that you know strong strong exceptional um USC you know a lot of networks\nWell their spirit is this fair to the school says trying to write the alumni network is foreign and others I think there's also an emphasis on a culture of excellence at USC and that's really important and I see that in the way you treat gas at the airport you know a very high standard a culture of excellence and the culture of\nPersonalization in terms of the experience that people have so\nA very smart move and a at a Trojan I think it's a great idea to make that kind of connection\nOn you know when you think about a partnerships like that you have to look for brands that reflect your brand jobs are there any other partnerships that are coming up that we should know about that you are or that you're thinking about her as people think about Ontario say hey we'd be a great partner for them criteria that you're using\nWell I think you know I think there's there's kind of two um two areas where you're looking for partners in Southern California and we love\nYou know one of the way we would help or harm us ships to bring into the airports do business with us you know we were aligned with the war and everything and that says it says Southern California rockers does as well but also\nYou know I think we're probably more of you know if you just kind of an old um I wouldn't sell to personal companies but in the airport road we're a little bit more like an old ... rather than an IBM if you go back thirty\nYears I like it I like it ... it is has been ... thank you\nFor telling us about the growth and the future for Ontario international airport truly appreciate that this has been a conversation with Marx or the c._e._o. at the fast growing Ontario international airport in the international airport authority and a ... a great alternative to that crowded busy LAX\nWith a new and expand it flights and the patients checkout Ontario that's oh empty Ontario international airport in the Inland Empire\nThank you for spending time

Trump says he will pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia he says Russia is breaking the treaty and correspondent Brian Brown says there are concerns over China's arsenal\nRight but unlike substances like alcohol or cocaine or heroin we don't need those things to survive right wing [laughter]\nSo not that abstinence or said friday from a chemical addiction is easy not by any means but we don't actually need those things to live we do need food right we do need sex we do need love we do need money to operate ... in this day in time so\nWhat I find is that a lot of people come into therapy or come into treatment thinking\nThey're broken beyond repair and not getting help means going with out and being in this sort of dichotomy as a way of thinking where they're either really deprivation all or really over indulge and and so forth and I think about health I agree with you I think about balance in moderation and how can people create\nA wheel around an all of the different domains of their lives were there's room for some fluidity and balance so he\nCan work take up as much time as family as much time as leisure as much time as\nLearning a new hobby or a skill as much time as a spiritual practice and can we leave a little bit of room for there to be more emphasis put on one to me to fly for a short period of time and then bring it back and so we're constantly looking at you know what is going on\nMy world and how am I shifting and moving with it in the way that is\nWhen you write I really like the concept of fluidity um which is the opposite of rigidity and they think that it's really important as with anything to really have a two men and not only do we need to be attuned with our partners and what are their needs and wants and feelings but also with our own\nSo you know we might have you know a schedule set up but maybe we don't feel like doing that\nAnd so I think that a lot of times people on recovery can also get very rigid um this is what I Do at this time which is a boundary that sometimes works and create structure inconsistency\nBut I think it's important to pay attention to to what our needs are maybe we're filling a little worn down a little uh you know burned out and we need to take a little self care time or vice versa mhm\nThat's such a great point that you bring up\nA very good friend who's in recovery\nFor sex addiction and he's traveling to the United states he's not from here and he landed and had a very strict plan of all of the different fellowship meetings he was going to attend but when he landed he couldn't get any sleep and the jet lag was worse than he anticipated\nAnd so we had to make a very calculated decision and he called a sponsor and said\nI'm so tired I Can't even think straight but I told myself I was going to go to this meeting what should I Do and he was really torn up about it and felt like he was letting his recovery down because he didn't go to this meeting and his sponsors said\nDo you have to sleep he wrote it can go to a meeting later in the day and it hadn't even dawned on him because he was so stuck in this Richard I like what I have to do\nRight and again that rigidity sometimes as necessary to be getting to the right yes because there's a concept that you know when we're in our disease whatnot\nUm one best thinking landed them where they are so it's not a good idea to listen to their thinking and their plan but eventually that even out and we can start creating that sense of um intuition with what we need\nYeah well I think about and not to compare adults or children but let's face it when we're in early recovery usually we're operating from a pretty early developmental stage right and one of the things I'll often say to patients is that you've got to borrow the intellectual and cerebral functioning\nOf the people around you who are a little bit further along and this has just like when we're kids we don't know what to do so we're borrowing the intellectual functioning of our parents as a scaffold to get where we need to be and learn what we need to learn\nRight and I think also you know Seamus such is such an intolerable emotion and really at the roots of so many addictions and so if for shaming ourselves for not being perfect or not being successful at the rigid plan that we set up and we're just contributing to the problem mhm\nMhm well I think you know all of those are so important to remember as we're thinking okay well what does healthy mean for me and I would always encourage people to sit down and do an inventory of their life\nAnd we have tools that we use at train therapy group to help people do that ... that really it's about evaluating where's their messiness in my life or where is one part of my world dominating\nThe other parts of my world and can you look at that openly and honestly and just say okay so now I can make some changes I have choices about how I Want to live\nRight personally I Know when I'm not balanced and I'm working too much I start feeling it um I started getting irritable my car starts getting really messy and those are some signs that something out of balance and often it's emotional to own being you know just some bad mood not feeling my bus kind of cut off from joy\nAnd really if I take a look at my life it's missing some balance that week or ... you know and I just it's a signal that I Need to make some changes\nDefinitely definitely I Know for me it's when I come home on a friday and I look at my my house and I look at the kitchen sink\nUsually are so many dishes in it that turned on left in the cabinet [laughter] that's my my cue to say oh you really haven't been paying attention to their self care you know and it's important\nYou know and and those little things can really be big signals that some things out of whack and inevitably those weeks when the kitchen sink is full of dishes I can look back at my workweek and think oh man I dropped the ball on that or I was looking at\nThe singer I forgot to call my partner back and let him know what he means to me and you know right just a start recognizing just how chaotic the rest of it is\nRight we can get really wrapped up in the house without consciousness mhm and so it's nice to take some time to reflect\nIt really is and you know one of the things that we often do in our work with patients that try and therapy group is help them with some coaching you know help them get back on track and\nGet back to investing in themselves and in that scene we've created so many different coaching programs that can be done in person or can be done on line and they include all kinds of things like recognizing when you want to jumpstart your recovery and we have a twelve week course that allows for a jumpstart\nAnd looking at things like gosh I just got out of this relationship that\nSucked all of my energy out of me how do I get back to being me and we also have a great program for anger management because I notice that oftentimes and people are not living in a healthy balanced way we start to see objects and anger resentment and Rachel behavior all of those programs can be found on our website\nTrying therapy dot com that's T. R. I. U. N. E. therapy dot com and we have to take a quick break right now but when we come back we'll talk more about what does it mean to be healthy anyway with two really special guests one doctor ... strong a rundown plastic surgeon and the owner of Kansas plastic surgery in Atlanta\nAnd Dr ... ... ...

I don't know why that's a challenging thing\nOn the right before we went on break\nWe were talking about this idea of what's the difference between health and wellness and as you both are physicians I'm curious about how the medical field or how you specifically address this issue said Dr son he we're talking a little bit about what a scene in your world as plastic surgery and can you elaborate on that the distinction\nYeah I mean you can have people I'm a who are very thin very fit you know ... work out all the time and you can tell I'm I'm a healthy\nYou know there there I'm sure their cholesterol great there you know heart health has great ... everything's great um but that doesn't mean that they're happy or well adjusted mhm um\nAnd I think I think if you I wouldn't necessarily classify that person as um as as comprehensively healthy or I don't know what will you know well that that their wellbeing you know they're they're well adjusted\nPeople so I'm you know it's if there's a mental aspect to all of this as well um\nAnd uh um you know some something that I I I'm Still learning myself because I you know that's not what we're taught in medical school medical ... medicine a lot of it is a is not about prevention\nYou know they I mean nutrition was like an open book course for you know one quarter in medical school uh you know we gloss over that and they focus you know so intensely on\nOn you know how how does a drug work\nHow does disease process work and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but it it it will be interesting if there were more focus on on on real prevention diet exercise you know meditation ... I'm taking time for yourself I mean if you're not\nA religious person or you can or even what's called spiritual um you know being a reflective person ...\nSomebody who gains appreciation for what they have in life and is always looking for the next thing to to buy 'em you know I mean we all know that I think experiences lead to more happiness in life and you know driving for Ariz\nAnd ran out ... ... experience [laughter] I don't know right exactly um but yeah you know I mean material possessions don't make us happy and a lot of times I think people focus on that but yeah it went back to your little go ahead sorry I don't\nKnow it was just commenting on break we are talking about how a lot of times people are kind of emotionally unhealthy or mentally I'm healthy and they put a lot of effort into fixing everything on the outside looking in mathematics surgery an external possessions but the truth is it's really an inside job ... ...\nAbsolutely and and those are the people that that that are good candidates for surgery mhm right well I think now\nThat I get operated on all the time your brain wrong if they walk in with five to ten thousand dollars and you know the a lot of doctors out there will just you know take it and and look the other way and keep going\n... yeah and I'm sure it's also not only obviously some people can do a good time at hiding\nBut the problem is that that doesn't correct the problem right correct yes\nWell I Wonder Dr ... on the flipside of that you often work with people who\nFrom the outside looking in don't look like they're in pain don't look like they have any ongoing chronic issues that they're navigating and yet their internal world is completely\nAbandoned by their pain and their experience but the outside world doesn't necessarily see that so I Wonder about how you define the difference between wellness and health and and how you navigate that with patients whose issues normally\nNormally not the best word but can be invisible\nUh it's a it's an excellent question and and trying to distinguish between health and wellness sometimes is a it was difficult there is there is some blurring there where ... in your house or you think of as being something physical and and of course the the mental\nOr aspects of it as well emotional and behavioral uh whereas wellness is you would think ah how someone emotionally feels about their health their own\nThat make them feel good so it's like the goodness sensation are good feeling and there are quite a lot of pain patients that come in through our doors that on the surface they look like they're coping and managing\nGreat they look like a healthy person just a ... their little labs are numbers on a on a blood work or on a on a EKG or one of the blood pressure everything looks\nFine and you can't really get a number on pain you can't really just measure that in the same way you can measure someone's a laboratory work or blood work or other types of tests or\nYou can look at an imaging study and say well you've fractured your leg and so there's something clearly wrong there and that should be causing pain mhm but so many of the pain that we see are are much more than that I Wish you the mosquito skeletal world there's a lot of people dealing with stock or neck pain or other chronic joint issues\nBut it's more than just that physical ailment that we're dealing with a day in and day out it's the the the injured person who was the ... or is the the family's primary honor isn't\nSuch relied upon counted upon to provide for other people in so many different roles and now all of a sudden cat quite do that is not as\nActive or not as able bodied to do all the things that not only are there people are counting on but that fill their life and make them happy someone that normally likes to go for a run on the weekend that can't do it and that gives them joy and now you're taking away that joy that's\nTaking away some of that wellness um and or they're requiring to have to take some medication sometimes and sometimes you know especially in ...\nTimes uh with the opioid crisis people are taking some powerful medications at times and trying to not have to take them\nRight it's got a a three day three stroke or motor ... seminar\nFor trends and a three Seventy three ... a year in it um anyway what issues I'm having the electric choke that need to be adjusted uh like twice a year or\nTwo adjusted they should stay adjusted\nUh-huh\nI can you know what I call started out at the federal one time left turn the key and it'll start but it was just a little rough and then I kind of like that at all and then it'll smooth itself out so\nWell maybe it's a little too tight just lean it up a little bit maybe the joke is just too tired to minor adjustments\nYeah yeah like I said it just as good a district cap and then a\nDeal back and just back off a little bit just a very low but you do it when it's cold then you'll see where the butterfly on top is close just back off a little bit and you problem solve my friend without any problem whatsoever and then in fact uh let me know and I'll just buy that car primary for five hundred\nDollars

differential but\nUh it depends on what kind of noise may be just an actual bearing what is it making just a grinding noise\nIt\nMay be just an actual bearing why don't you have a diagnosis first before you make a decision making a noise is one thing that's like having to go into the dark I got a pain well let me check out and find out where to pain is coming from and what's causing it I hear ya\nI hear ya get diagnosed first\nAnd then we can make a decision because it was just an actual bearing something like that\nThat'd be something that's that's very simple so I Would get it completely diagnosed have that done first and then make a decision on how much you know what you want to go use repair and it was just an actual bearing that's not a real big deal and thanks so much\nFor your

things well and he worked hard getting that to me to send it to another address went on and on midway gym in walnut welcome to the program good morning\nMorning it was the mind that motorcycle did they did it shaped Harley or what happened that this goes way back I heard this program like mid to late eighties and one of the er the director for\nA Peter state decided to go over to to the factory in a bar or a Harley Davidson and that\nHe is running late so they won't let him in and one of the executive is coming out and they noticed that he had a\n... a very ... to tell you is upset\nSo the director or the executive\nSaid oh problem I'll take you through the factory said however leave your camera in the car lot long story short um\n... the secret was that um hard that sold various tools

good when I'm high because that's why they're doing it\nAnd so they go to Monday they go to Tuesday and they go throughout the week so now they're smoking you know seven days a week and then instead of once a day they go to two times a day three to I mean you have no idea how many donors I have come across\nIn my lifetime or who are smoking marijuana\nOr like it's going out of style and it's

is a much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market's going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification is far\nDifferent directional vehicles go well you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people playing out of the markets the Martin money's going somewhere either going to gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock chart bond chart gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now imagine that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy right you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up\nIt's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse you're going to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster\nSo a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ally ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we were by a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to\nCheck it out for it\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals truly guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's\nWhat they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to is up to the individual to make sure that they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now

hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different\nIt's all about that consistent approach being able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the

like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income that's a great\nRight you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy taking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have ... fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at ...\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward\nFor Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed time I needed my life\nAnother student says ...\nAl ... and ... and I

instructor development and half instructor it online trading shed some light on multiple streams of and can we talk a little bit about\nPassive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first a skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a ... a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same that that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's payday and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck when we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say\nYou know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside ran that's really that point you were getting at a before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people make because they think they could do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you in a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is why I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach your students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd that's the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent dropped Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty St yep same thing and so if we company here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and\nUh you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops in counseling and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about uh Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify\nWhere to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to another half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing how do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed\nWith lessons from some of our top instructors to professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and

two dollars or two million dollars that the classes were you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nAt my desk off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the
