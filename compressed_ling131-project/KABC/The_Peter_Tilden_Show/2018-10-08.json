{"content": "And then what a lot of our students do they actually trade while they're on vacation as long as you're doing it and the timeframe that won't piss somebody else off and do you do that all the time Ryan is the idea that you can be making money anywhere you go and we have a student her name was Hayley\nShe's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce and which is added to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough and had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you can start generating money that you could pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody want to help in the future\nAnd I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I I spent my my winners in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually came up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to\nA Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like well yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty freezing cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that sort of the things that that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times Larry where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I I was ... down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only works for like eight AM to like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know we had dial up Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge\nCan really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the palm of our hand\nIdentify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather communist when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the prices are going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away and that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price\nThat's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from buildings skill a great place to start that is at the half the class we've got a few tickets left before the show's over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay alright\nRight now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have take classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of past is one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's gonna be the professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like in hand senior retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider ... makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if\nIn colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you could scores of passes there were some of the other kind of examples you could share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nLet's consistency Ryan most people come in they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have\nTo be willing to commit ... beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now then you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I have heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact ... once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expect in a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nAnd I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is and I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nAnd he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and it's the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during one of the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got now one of the ways that where we start this off when the best ways to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time pass and let's get some people educated changed their lives our right well right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area\nAnd they have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over include with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders cat\nNow this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like in ... retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down\nGeneration capital preservation crypto currency and much much more\nThe professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now the ... century twenty

I mean I Would I took pictures and someone said stay away from politics I Love that and it was like I barely in politics so I Love that the one thing I Know you like the mermaid palace but he's like please and I are you kidding me wait a minute I'm a mom I have kids and I doubt\nI I've been a woman who is I Know now I'm going on a tangent let me go back to where you're going with Scott and you just stop me I have ADHD\nSo I feel OK lie down 'cause I Know but like I I\nI don't know right now I think it is affecting every aspect\nOf the movie business and more more so than anything else about feelings and what's going on with hiring women I mean they just passed a law now and not even with that there has to be a woman\nOn every board of directors and California ... right so I'm I'm taking all the amount that I don't think that's just my thing but in a you can read it I mean it also has\nTo do with the the stature of the performer that we're talking like deniro with respect to how it's going to affect his or her career I mean Iraq's here who's an institution right right he can say whatever he wants to be probably doesn't have to worry too much about\nHis career even much younger performer like Amy Schumer she just got arrested a few days ago it had that one of the demonstrations\nShe's very well established I don't think it's going to adversely affect her career there might be some other people who are in a more\nRevenue on the spot a professionally\nWho might be a little bit more to the timid voicing their strong opinions about something because they don't have that kind of cache they don't have that kind of leverage\nWhy should they write to them though [noise] why should they be ... ... why should they be scared [noise] well you might argue that that they shouldn't be but I mean I think I think everybody\nYou know sort of a harbors their own biases and and we're red tend to show postures\nWhat am I missing in actually a world a sphere\nHairs I mean it's that's what they're cultivating their cultivating if you sneak out or if you do this ... it's the freedom of speech actually oddly enough it's interesting how it's it's changing its whole value system because oh God\nDid you want to say that I Know of all I just I heard that law so I was like what does that mean alright I I don't I Know don't follow it but it it just sounds [laughter] [laughter] I didn't\nI didn't curse or a thing is I feel like people think maybe it's true maybe it's not but people think it's getting harder and harder to simply have a disagreement\nAbout or some political question that\nTo choose one side over and above another ... is now a moral imperative\nSo if you're on the other side of this dividing line\nYou know you are you are you are that immoral posture and that it's\nAnd that's why I think it gets so heat is like you see these Facebook exchanges amongst fan out ... and it gets normally it gets ugly it's not about whether we're debating the merits of a particular policy here or there it's it's it's much ... ... yeah much more visceral than the\nUh incidentally if anybody wants to call in and talk to Jessica or Michael it's one eight hundred to two to five to do to can you give the phone number I'll just go\nYeah where do you want me what eight hundred what is it is ... where am I going oh okay geeze written regularly to just a huge\nKnives so special one eight hundred to two to five to to to call in and really get my political point of view which is interesting [laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] oh All right sad or was he didn't do anything okay no it's it's a it's a question I think that a lot of actors in Hollywood like Britain I mean they don't they they don't say nobody says anything I mean I'm\nI'm On this show with you and Jessica so I'm trying to be very diplomatic if I let loose and told you how I really feel you know I'd yeah we make as many enemies as friends you know\nI agree [noise] go ahead with loose [laughter] advocate oh man I could go\nTo a game yeah I Know you're going to get out and let me ask you\nWell let me ask you Jessica you do stand up comedy at the clubs and ...\nMentioned before that somebody said don't do anything political that now every Seinfeld made a comment that he would not do any Trump jokes\nI think uh actually yeah I was it's interesting there's so many levels to that it's not even people did Trump jokes there's tons of\nYou know I think it's a little too close to home to like one of the cats and I'm like\nMy daughter did not Snapchat her ... okay it is a joke\nAll right that this is really how to break we got to break out half\nThe show's over a we have to sell some products and then we're going to come back and do the other half of the show this is a fascinating show it's a very interesting show and don't go anywhere we'll be right back with Jessica and Michael seeing a few minutes by\nTalk radio seven Ninety take ABC these updates times to become

one bedroom apartment for himself\nAnd four children paying Fifteen hundred dollars a month\nPeople keep moving farther and farther away from their jobs because uh they can't afford a house\nAnd then they get hit with this gas tax which I Hope we're going to talk about you know\nWhat you or hurt again no specific strategies let me give you a specific strategy to ... to address the example that John just advanced that we have a desire to take our eighty five million dollar affordable housing tax credit increase it over the next few years the five hundred million dollars to leverage more financing for for double housing\nAnd we have strategies to address workforce housing and those were where the jobs go to sleep the quote unquote missing middle or for middle class families we have a specific strategy to address the issue of tax increment we lost redevelopment\n... years ago and we never came up with successor agencies that we have specific goals on enhanced infrastructure financing districts in this state taking advantage of these opportunities I once again what you heard from John is an illusory strategy or where he criticized as NIH and identifies problems but with all due respect doesn't have\nThe details and the strategies actually saw what\nYou what you heard from Gavin is more government more plans to pay out money from government tax credits ... plans for government financing but if you don't really attack\nCost of building\nThe delays in building the litigation the lawsuits the impacts fees that are put on housing in the state if you don't do that what you're going to do is instill institutionalize these high rents\nI don't want rents costing three thousand dollars for a two bedroom apartment and then have government come along and subsidized people for a short time that is going to put us even more in debt and it's not addressing the problem and I have specific plans on dealing with\nAll right let's move to a new topic um voters you know have a right to know who you guys are what your values are what how you work what kind of governor you'd be because if you when you're gonna have to work for the legislature and you're going to be appointing department heads and all this stuff so I have a question a different question for each of you starting with you Mr new some\nThroughout your career you've had a series of public ... shall we say with a elected officials for supervisors when you were mayor\nUh there were a lot of back and forth comments a and sometimes when you get asked a tough question by reporters you didn't like it you know someone said them again\nAs lieutenant governor you had a difficult relationship with Jerry Brown at the beginning you tangled publicly with the state Senate president pro tem over gun control you know and and also a back and forth with the speaker Anthony rented over single payer so my question is like what is it you know what does that say about your ability to get along with the people you need to get along\nWell I I get along extraordinarily well with the legislature currently I get along and got along very well with most of the members of the San Francisco board of supervisors but I'm interested in change\nOr you know changing the order things as difficult some people have different points of view\nOr the speaker is a different point of view on single payer financing or members of the San Francisco board of supervisors at different points of view on homeless strategies and different points of view on health care strategy so look I'm In a certain myself I'm going to be bold are not many people came to my defense when we advance same sex marriage you didn't include that you should\nBecause the overwhelming majority of Democrats in this country some of the most uh I think well known democratic leaders were very very critical publicly of my willingness to lean into that I took on the national Rifle Association or they weren't police or by\nUh those efforts to require background checks not just for gun purchases but now I'm innocent purchases so if you're looking for timidity on not your person if you're looking for someone to be bold and courageous lean into issues changed the order of things I'm committing myself to that causes the next ... do you think\nThough that you can be bold and not timid without getting in ...\nWith your I won't get periodic look I've been doing this for some time and there's there's areas of disagreement and sometimes people are disagreeable my intention is to go together and not go alone learn a lot over the years and uh my approach and what have you learned from\nExperience I think at the end of the day I'm you know there is that African proverb or that is if you want to go fast go alone but if you want to go far go together\nAnd you know I when I look back over the course of twenty plus years as mayor to relatively young age and there was a desire to do everything all at once and I think issues of prioritizing bringing people into your vision making people feel part of the team those are all lessons those are all attributes I Hope to bring the government had a question\nFor you voted out did you want to see is going really well yeah\nI just want to emphasize that you know I come from the private sector where I have to work with people and get things done and achieve results and I've done that for forty years and not everybody in my team agrees with everything that we have but we what we got to do is we got to get people allied around common goals and try to figure out the way to reach those goals and I think that's what I'm gonna do as governor\nOur and for you I have a question about values you started off your political life as a Democrat you ran in Illinois to be a delegate to the Nineteen Seventy six democratic convention and then he became a Republican you ran for local office in Chicago and then the U.S Senate from Illinois guy named Brock Obama won that\nAnd you write for president in two thousand Seventy thousand eight\nAnd I just wanted to ... refresh some of the points you made during those times you said or we need a federal marriage amendment to keep the same sex couples from marrying you said we have and I'm quoting we have a problem with transvestite teachers [noise] ah you said that if we don't use common sense we will quote open the floodgates the polygamy and best reality\nUh and all kinds of other things and you know I could go on but I'm I'm guess I'm asking is what is what does that say you've got your values and about your um your kind of governor you\nYour ear ... specifically referring to uh you know the issue of gay marriage I have a other well maybe so but you know the fact of the matter is that the those were many many years ago I have a bald on those issues and frankly just like a rock Obama and Hillary Clinton who both oppose gay marriage are very strongly for a long time they evolved and they change but\nYou know I think the the thing to take away from all that is that all the way through my efforts be in the past\nI've been fighting against the establishment and about corruption or you know my mom was a Chicago school teacher that's what led me to want to fight corruption is the corruption of the special interests that are making California too expensive\nAnd too on equal for people and that's what I'm going to attack and California as\nWell you say you've evolved in that's fair although a ... he was mayor at the time that you said those things it wasn't a like in a long long time ago I mean\nSo maybe so but in as as recently as a two thousand three hundred thousand for Brock Obama and Hillary Clinton were both against gay marriage so [noise]\nI have a ... on on those issues ah and ah and I think they are not going to be germane to this I think the important issues in this race or the affordability for people in this state the ability to live a productive life and afford gasoline and water and electricity and\nYou know uh the failing schools that were having to put up with I think those are far more important issue\nScott and I mean what is germane though is to understand more fully looks one thing to have quote unquote evolved on on same sex marriage I certainly respect that\nBut you supported a constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage you you said you quite as Scott mentioned this and I haven't heard you\nAre of all on this that homosexuality leads to be ... that what you did and you were quoted as saying that and to quote unquote other things you you talked about transvestites is in a way of\nA vaccine notion that some people can choose to be home school to stay away from a quote unquote transvestites have evolved on those specific points people at the right to know that John\nI have and you know again this is all meant\nTo take the topic away from the important things that people are worried about here in the state and that has the ability to rent a a decent apartment as a ... to talk about what else should against us grim a nation against renting as well the ... hosted discrimination of all foreign\n... coming up on a break a real quickly for each of you which one of the represents the mainstream of California veterans Scott's\nI think I'd do it because I represent the people who are just trying to get by uh I wasn't putting office by billionaires I'd you know I I had to work my way up I had to say it was all go all the way through and and that's something that I think the people at the state of the dead of I was\nFifteen seconds [laughter] so I certainly think we represent the vast majority of California's reject John Cox is a ... agents that Trump and Trump ism a and his longstanding advocacy for causes that I don't think the vast majority of Californians and prices\nAre and you're listening to the gubernatorial debate on kick you we the I'm Scott Shafer we're going to take a very short break and we'll be right back\nOn TALK radio Seventy KBC we're back again to listen to the one and only debate it's amazing no no TV debates\nUm and again they would benefit John Cox to get his message out there more uh it doesn't benefit Gavin Newsom to do a lot of debates because when you're in the lead in a blue state what you don't want is a mishap or or or primetime gaffe that people are going\nTo remember so this is the one and we'll take your calls afterwards as you saw they started within it is it's more of a conversation a and I don't think it's going to get very heated but John Cox was talking about the red tape and how to build and how to grow and overcome the problems that we have\nWith the status quo here in California as far as the housing ah whereas Gavin Newsom even said we're ... he's looking to reform and he said it may have to be um as a matter of fact\nA punishing a bit and he talked about even prop Thirteen is on the table which perked up I'm sure a lot of people's a hearing at that point and the local government maybe have to be a little bit punitive\nUm as far as a values or as soon as they ask John Cox about his run as a Democrat in Illinois I'm recalling change so quickly here they went\nThe governor and Gavin Newsom the Democrat let's switch topics and talk about criminal justice a last month a Governor Brown signed a couple of bills giving the public uh under certain conditions more access to police personnel records and the video from police body cameras\nLet's say we're here and that is that we're talking about guns we're talking about all these other social issues that I'm not running to change one iota I I'm not I am running\nTo make sure that people in this state have an affordable life they have schools that are not failing they have available water affordable water affordable electricity all these other things are being done to\nOccupy time and uh you know really are\nNot address the issues that we ought to be addressed and that is the cost of living in the state and the horrendous conditions of people that are struggling and trying to get by but those same families John have the right to go drop their kids off at school without worrying tiger weapon of war is being used by someone that didn't get a conference and ... and you've not an every instance you have not been there\nFighting for common sense ... would you want me to give any in in a green that we should ask the media not to publicize the names and pictures of people who are good ones that have just grown to deflecting your fundamental ... any common sense gun safety all I'm not\nI'm not opposed to what about background checks I'm not opposed to using a re a this is this is a red herring and a you know this is about ... keeping up keeping reminiscent purchasing guns out of the hands of people that are mentally ill is a wonderful thing and I will certainly back that up completely alright where you've\nBoth talked about affordability and cost of living in California and so we have a listener question uh looks listening\nHi my name is Cindy ... I'm from Santa Clara California and I'd like to ask a candidate what is your position on California's Proposition ...\nHard to that eliminates certain road repair and transportation finding out to have a fire\nThat said though yet a fixture killed the gas tax don't get to carry it around each of them what their position at California proposition ...\nEmily beginning it's quite clear we've talked about this before you you have opposite positions on this so you Mr Cox about suburb supporter of driving force behind prop sick getting on the ballot you support the repeal\nOr Mr new some you oppose it and I'm just wondering what what do each of you think the other one's position says about the kind of governor they would be\nWell I think it's clear ah I think Gavin would not exercise enough control over the efficiency of our spending the Caltrans\nCaltrans has been regularly a highlight it as one of the more inefficient uh agencies in the country it spends way more than a lot of other states to build a mile of road\nAnd uh there's a lot of contractors who make hefty contributions to Gavin as well as to Mr Brown and ah and you know they build that into their cost and that the public pays for it instead of reforming that system how would you do that\nWhat we need to get the money out of politics and I'm going to be talking about that day one on November seventh after my elected uh but you know we also need to make sure the Caltrans use it is money efficiently and you know the politicians are like Gavin went ahead and approved an increasing the gas tax they didn't want to do the tough job\nThe tough job would have been making Caltrans a live within its means\nThe tough job would have been modifying sequel which which by the way it's been waved for a lot of sports stadiums uh who have connected investors\nAre but it's not been waved for road building and it's driven up the cost of housing or for housing and it's driven up costs and the people are paying for it and they can't keep doing that they are struggling unable to live in the states do to you then what\nWould you what does it say about the kind of governor you well let me I'll answer that but I Want to make some fundamental points here San jose in San Francisco and LA of the worst road conditions in the United states of America\nOr what John just argued for us to make things worse his plan is to make things worse the fact is the legislature and the governor finally began to address this issue in a substantive way\nHe's talking about taking away over five billion dollars every single year for road improvements\nPublic safety improvements addressing the issue of traffic congestion which ended up itself as a hidden tax\nAnd to reconcile the fact that twenty seven other states since two thousand and Thirteen of increased uh their sales tax or rather gas taxes in an effort to improve their routes he chooses not to do that he talks about the loser a notion of efficient how to use race or the fact is John you may not be aware of this that the entire payroll\nAccount trans two point eight six billion dollars you can eliminate every single position I imagine that's the ultimate manifestation of efficiency know instill struggle to find the money or that you are taking away in advocating taking away from improving our roads our town of ...\nRunning a ... a surplus right now and it generates tens of billions of dollars\nFrom motor vehicle related uh sources or sales taxes on cars other things like that that are being used we have a surplus\nOr why are you about that guy or we digging into the pockets of people who are already paying\nThe highest housing prices the highest water prices\nThe highest electricity prices in the country on what's the plan and we build the roads and we really use that old or a lot more dollars come from we're going to use money efficiently and we're not going to we're going to cut good deals with contractors and\nYou know he can ... he can laugh about it because this budget has zoomed under the last eight years when Mr you know when Gavin was\nWas the governor and uh the budget has zoomed now it's over two hundred billion dollars for me and they haven't been building roads\nBecause the last governor ah you're running of course you're a Republican the last Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger or I mean you you said in your commercials that Democrats broke it they broke everything that's why the stakes a mess but\nJury found inherited a twenty six billion dollar deficit and he's leaving as you say a surplus so and part of what Arnold Schwarzenegger ran on was cutting the contacts so and the ... budget\nYou got to remember twenty tennis when Governor Brown took office\nThe whole country was in a financial disaster at that point in time and so\nBy cutting the arts acts contributed to that well no not necessarily no me either not housing crisis and the and the financial officer and I mean well yeah but the belt budget melt melt down and that's another issue that we need to talk about and that is the reliance on a very thin layer of people to finance this government\nAnd we've built up a huge amount of cost in this in this budget that has to be addressed\nAnd you know my Gavin is not going to address those things I'm going to have to address them because you know in the private sector I Can't afford to waste money I have to use every penny efficiently and that's not being done to Sacramento we're going to find\nEfficiency of culture and but I Want to make a point that you're right emphasizing released from your question we inherited a twenty seven billion dollar\nBudget deficit we have an eight and a half billion dollar budget surplus we've got a hundred and one consecutive months of net job growth a three point seven percent GDP Growth rate average over the last four years the lowest unemployment in recorded history or California's great at three\nA million jobs under governor Brown's ... ah since two thousand ten we're proud of that record there are stubborn areas where we have to do more and do better on homelessness on housing the broader issues of cost of living I concur and the difference between myself and my opponent John Cox is we actually have strategies and plans\nTo address those issues with respect\nTo the other end of all kinds of quote unquote efficiencies that ... I can assure you that's not going to build any road or\nReminisce or talk to your so you're saying that the money there because there's a circus but what happens in a downturn I mean the ... the gas tax is going to be generating five billion dollars for ten years so in a down those down years which are inevitable where the money ... we've\nGot a certainly broaden that we've got to get a look at every expense that we in her uh we've got to audit every agency and we got to get root out the the waste in this budget and believe me there's a lot of it this budget has increased tremendously ah and ah there's a there's a tremendous amount of waste and and and mismanagement that's going on this\nBudget All right we saw a much more to talk about you're listening to the gubernatorial debate on Cape Cod I'm Scott Shafer romantic a very short break and we will be back with Gavin Newsom ... [noise] talk\nRadio ... ABC Peter children will be done for your while you're listening to the debate between John Cox and Gavin Newsom will take your calls after\nYour response to how they did I'm waiting for high speed rail um when we asked that question I remember John Cox has a very tough road to hoe because he can't he's in a blue state and he's got to balance and you heard it when we talked about that when they were talking about gun rights\nYou're talking about the budget you're talking about prison reform so he's dancing around a bit because he said he didn't even vote for President Trump and you know his Democratic before but now he's talking about waste a noose around again has been part of the problem is saying for the last sixteen years of great that you're entering the free now but how come you didn't do anything about it\nFor the last sixteen years since ... those are some of the issues like I said I'm waiting for high speed rail\nI'm to be brought out they were just talking about prop six and we'll talk about that when we come down they talked about their values they talked about crime they talked about bill they talked about housing I'm quite a few instances of changing\nThe topic said in the subject when he got a little bit uncomfortable but again not heated pretty civil I'm John Cox a businessman who says he's gonna again do as a president that he can do better deals Gavin Newsom Connor even though we're only listening and then seeing it sounded like a bit of a smart than a bit of condescension there and saying you're are you going to change and so\nHere's to hear what you think your cake and we're back to the big right now talking to somebody KBC\nAnd we continue our conversation with the candidates for governor John Cox and Gavin Newsom I Want to say that ah before today or we reached out to a lot of reporters that we respect from places like the LA Times Cal matters San Francisco chronicle a political in our public radio partners and we got their suggestions for\nA the principles and goals in the objectives that have been outlined over the last few years uh and make them real substantively the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions forty percent below Nineteen Ninety levels by twenty thirty a that is going to be a challenge I'm up for that challenge to John is not again a stark contrast toleration\nGiven life to make these political statements and I think it's but it's a law wonderful wonderful goal to have renewable energy I'm I'm all in favor\nBut we can't keep increasing the cost of electricity I favor nuclear power I think that can be done cleanly a natural gas or\nCan be done cleanly I Believe we we we could you know a used technology to ultimately a have cars that are much cleaner burning but we right now the wind doesn't always blow in the sun doesn't shine and we need to make sure that we have a backup\n... Jerry Brown has been taken flack from the left from the keep it in the ground a lobby about fracking at about drilling in California not off the coast but in in a in the mainland of California would you reverse those policies that he's an act\nYeah I I think will tighten them up I think fracking starting to fall and so tired of Wall Street is the one leading this recognition ah you're seen interest rates rise the fracking a experiment is beginning to wane ah so I think that's a natural opportunity for the next governor to get a little bit more aggressive as early as fracking but\nAgain California is leading in almost every capacity we're creating jobs were leaning into the future uh this is California has a great uh I think foreign policy or it's one that I'm very proud that Governor brown has led a and boy I really hope folks are paying attention I Would be very cautious to revert back\nTo the normalization of deviant she has a relates to lack of intention allergy or and leadership around climate change California has a responsibility has an important international role to play I Am committed and passionate about that I Want to lead [noise] that's wonderful\nExcept that people can't afford to live in this state and they're moving out and our lecturers the costs are gasoline costs are pounding the average person and it's all well and good to talk about this wonderful goal that we have let's work toward it but let's not kill people in terms of their affordable lifestyle okay\nWe've got a few more minutes I Want to try and give them a couple of more topics in today's Brett Kavanaugh's first full day on the job at the Supreme Court and both of you have young daughter daughter's you have four daughters Mr Cox you have two daughters younger [noise]\nAh but I'm Wondering like what do you think is such a bitter confirmation battle a lot of women are concerned what it means for reproductive rights and that sort of like what's your take away a from from what happened I mean what what what would you tell your daughters of ask your conversation with them\nYou know I I regret to all the ... in politics today or if I have anything to say about it I'm going to try to get reforms that reduced the vis a vis in politics I think a lot of it has to do with fundraising\nAnd uh I think you saw that with a lot of the politicians in Washington on both sides a fundraising off there\nAre extreme statements and frankly you see it in this discussion with with Gavin you know trying to paint me as some you know uh as as different on so many issues and and and re characterize might positions or you know I think\nWhat we need to do is we need to take a step back and and try to get more comedy more\nAh you know kindness and a issue discussion in the world politics and you know I take a back seat as you mentioned a you know I have four daughters my mom was a working mom I think a doctor for it needed to be heard and and should have been bullied\nAnd a voted to confirm Bryant you know I I I'm not going to get it get in the middle of that frankly I'm focused on the issues in California but I wanted to point out that I led the recall of Bob Filner in as the mayor of San Diego because I think anybody who\nUh uses their position of power and authority to impose themselves on an under a someone who is subordinate to them uh you know should be\nOr just in a you know should be removed from office frankly\nI think it's very relevant or you you say you care about the issues of California is very relevant and Kevin ...\nBecause you could have a profound impact on California in California it's\nOn their reproductive rights which you do not believe a woman has a right to choose regardless whether or not their rape or or had tragic and sort of incest or Kavanaugh will play an outsized role in that you've been an advocate for the repeal of the Affordable CARE Act which would have cost or in the Graham Cassidy bill one hundred and thirty eight point eight billion dollars by twenty twenty\nSeven in the state of California and that also unlimited funding for Planned Parenthood\nA and that will impact reproductive rights to access a for millions and millions of women and not only this state but across the country these things are relevant\nOr issues of private property rights issues of access to our beach in waterfront\nUh issues associated with our dreamers and our immigration policy a Kevin I was going to play an outsized role in all those respective including presidential power for all those reasons I oppose this nomination and I think it was a sad day yesterday when he got sworn in real quick response if you have one of the south and everyone I\nI Will certainly appoint judges justices of the uh in California who will respect the constitution and respect the U.S constitution and the California Constitution and try to keep the politics out of it because it's just too much of the way of politics involved it\nWe're almost at the end I Want to get both of you an opportunity to just sort of summarized what's at stake in this election and and because of the twenty quaint us we're going to start with you Mr Nixon ...\nWell I I think there's an enormous amount of saying I think you've got a good sense of where we are in key positions on the question I think for the voters is who's got the best ideas moving forward who's got the practical experience who has the capacity to deliver on ideals and goals\nUh my biggest issue again remains the issue of addressing the income and wealth disparities in the state that doesn't ... in a way that doesn't because other people success\nBut addressed as these issues in his stomach way\nI run a campaign that's been positive our campaign commercials are not attacking my opponent or their attaching themselves to attacking problems with policy solutions and I think the most important thing and I want to\nJust reinforce it here today the most important thing the next governor can do is reconcile this fact eighty five percent of the brain is formed by the time someone's just three years old the most important investment we can make\nTo address the issue of systemic poverty address the issue criminal justice reform is to begin at the beginning invest in prenatal care early headstart nurse home visits\nA that is the architecture of life and that has a disproportionate biased I Want to bring into the work of governor and will be a top agenda if I'm successful this November district ... this election\nIs about change versus the status quo I represent change uh my opponent is for the gas tax he's for the train to know where that's a waste of money or for the taxpayers the state\nHis answer for the housing crisis uh is is a more government spending mine is to reduce the cost of housing so that people can afford to live in this state\nWe talk about education but the the schools are failing our children that as a future that we are giving up\nA I've been in the public sector of the private sector for forty years getting things done a Gavin has been in office for sixteen years he's been the lieutenant governor for eight years never had any of these things ah that he talked about in in solving the problems\nWe need to solve the problems with the state we need to get change we need to make sure that California leads the way on education a Ford ability on water\nA I Am against water rationing ah which he is four so there's a lot of areas that people need to know that we are opposed and I will make the state affordable livable again\nAll right thank you very much and I want to acknowledge that we didn't really talk about education absolutely true didn't talk about pension or or water healthcare big topics we didn't get to we had an hour or so I Know people to go to your website with Arnold\nI'd be willing to have another one of these discussions we are I guess it's important to I've agreed the five of these in a or a ... my uh my younger friends to\nDo that thank you very much both of you John Cox Gavin Newsom that concludes the kick you in the governor's debate there will be coverage and analysis of the debate throughout the day and many of these stations I'm Scott Shafer thanks to you for listening thanks to the candidates for being here and have a great day [noise]\n\nTalk radio Seventy KBC lot of conversation was

five to two whether it's about values or parole or bail a or\nA sanctuary city is very interesting to didn't get to high speed rail who said they didn't get the education they didn't get the health care they didn't get to a lot of issues but what's your what are your thoughts the elections\nAre coming up and uh like I said a nuisance shows and lead at this point talks as you heard once they know the debate because he wants face time which he's not getting love to hear what your take is eight hundred to two to five to to do and I'll be happy to give your mind when we're back right after the news here on TALK radio seven Ninety KBC [noise]\nListening six nine new three here the national key word and Ninety five\nDone thousands dollars\nWell then why not\nMore hands on ABC Los Angeles county cumulus station [noise]\nThe NBC News alive and the local eleven o'clock I'm Rob ... President Trump is finally having that meeting with the number two man at the\nJustice Department on board the presidential plane Bob Costas teeny as what the president said he had to sit down with the official actually overseeing the Russian collusion investigation\nThat here why I'm shocked that he didn't say you know the high speed rail needs to be stopped we need to take that budget to finance infrastructure they're dumb moves are dumb priorities have been made which is why the infrastructure is the way it is now people have been kicking the can down the road and who's responsible for that blah blah blah go for it but yeah he was\nHe was kind of got to hear him holding back\nBecause in a state this blue he's got to be very very careful you know he he didn't as I recall I didn't vote for Trump but he's supporting Trump helped him which is why he ended up running again\nWhy you've seen it go just go for it do to him because\nIn this day we are so poor and you know I'm not that lost people stand up brainwashed they can't even think straight anymore we need it change\nYour shoes again changes or as a as a buzz word but unless the they do something about it all of a sudden today the infrastructure is following the instructions falling you have known that for years and article which shows how we have been\nThan taxing untaxed in stocks the legislative endless office in Sacramento says the twenty Eighteen Nineteen budget send another record of it\nIt's thirty eight point six billion in jungle front spending plus fifty billion from special funds in addition to state will spend four billion in bonds bonds which I think that a hundred and seven billion in federal funds so they're going to decide how to allocate this money and the money comes from the general fund taxes\nAre which are personal income taxes sales and used acts and corporation taxes and they're projected to increase by four percent so it doesn't matter\nIf the revenue keeps going up and up and up and up and they have a surplus it's taxing taxing taxing tax and people are getting completely frustrated and they're getting tapped out too so you can hear the anger I Want to know if anybody was switched sides because of that model debate doom and boy in a parking money\nGood morning theater\nYeah I a year is this your question was uh have I has this debate settled in my mind\nOr anything having to do with the way I feel about the way things are grown in California right and yes it has because for a while I've been debating I leaving the state and this this uh\nThis uh the bait a has convinced me that I'm Out of here\nWhat specifically convinced you\nWell uh [noise] uh it sounds to me like Gavin loosens a program is more of the same but and that includes\nThat he didn't he didn't say it was going to get rid of crazy train never addressed the two hundred and eighty eight billion dollar unfunded pension\nA liability and I'm leaving something\nLike ... which is just leave it there the fact that we don't talk about the oil that he is the real problem\nIs that I'm Sorry the other thing is that uh you know we are riding the crest of a fabulous economy people you know there's more jobs and there are people to fill them\nAnd so everybody's working and yeah there's a lot of money coming into the state coffers this is going to change within about two or three years I mean there's always this the business cycle it always happens it will get\nSo uh so there was so we need our gas money back\nSpecifically I own some uh some apartment or a year that's right and uh I'm Amazed I mean I've got one section eight person it pays to our forty five dollars a month and the state pays a thousand two hundred and fifty dollars and so\nThat is so out of balance or I'm Sorry the section eight people pay a thousand two hundred and fifty dollars that is so out of balance it's incredible how can that continue\nWhere you're getting ready for the city where do you think about prop ten where the the city wants to be able to tell you how much you should charge for rent\nOh well that's a nonstarter\nCan you've actually ... can you imagine that and people don't understand what that is they think that if they if the government comes in and regulates what they can\nCharge for rent that's great because poor people will be able to live in ... in the city because housing costs are so through what they don't really realize is first off like you know a lot of mom and pops ... that rent okay and let's say you're renting to somebody very affordably for years\nAnd now they finally move out or die and he's I'm going to rent it to market value on the government's going wait a minute your rent is going way way up the other thing is an economist most economists say this if you're going to limit the rent you know what developers first of all you're going to convert to a condo so you can sell it\nUm and number two developers aren't going to come and develop were their revenue was limited where people say you know what you can't charge what you want to charge the lover [laughter] years what here's what you're going to charge ... ten\nSounds very fair but it it actually limit is limiting what you can do but I but looking a condom is I'm most economists say it doesn't help it doesn't help as a matter of fact\nI'm it's gonna hurt as far as rent is concerned 'cause people will gentrified bills the flip their apartment\nWhy should I deal with this I'll sell it somebody upgrade it or knock it down and build something new and bingo there you go and the rents just went\nThrough the roof of Frank and to look like they're morning would you want to say\nGood morning yeah a couple of things one ah regarding a proposition ... that what they what they didn't mention is that uh the gas tax is tied into the cost of living\nShow although it's twelve cents today it a few years it could be as much as fifty cents and and just keep going up and up and up\nThat's one thing the other thing is that the way they the way they wrote the gas tax on is that day um uh what they did is they they department lasted\nAnd they've got one section and they're they call it something transportation quarters or something to that effect but anyway they cater to hundred and fifty million dollars a year for that particular section\nAnd a foot that deals with is lanes on traffic areas that are heavily traveled where they can they can put money into alternate routes well right off the bat you know that they're talking about up of highly five is said go to south heavily trafficked\nSo they get high pocket change that two hundred and fifty million dollars and give it to the train and nowhere that\nWell they yes they have out that's one of the biggest problems with the gas taxes where's the money going and do they have to allocate it with a wink wink nod nod say it is which is why there's been this big rebellion in the ... people are struggling with the cost of living now you have the gas tax is what they\nDid nobody got into is that the state already is is making plans or they've already got something going on the ballot in a while and involved in it and then twenty or twenty ... twenty twenty ballot that uh that attacks a proposition Thirteen\nYeah they meant well that he that was thrown and that was the one that really got my ears to perk up back to the gas tax for ... for a minute\nYou didn't regrets it and the people who are at least able to afford it the working families who really need their cars to get to their jobs which are a distance from the home or going to be affected in a big way the diesel fuel um hits people who cannot afford to barely costs because it raises the price of everything is moving around California by truck and you're right\nThey have three million to install sidewalks on the Marvin ... beach\nAh three million for Santa Monica purchased tens zero emission electric vehicles Nineteen point seven million for the green so you start looking and you see where the money's going in your wait whoa wait a minute that's not going where you say it was going to go\nSo until the politicians prioritize the spending or we're not going to have six roads and and again more money more money more money we've raised record money in the west coast that it's going to change\nBut right now unless they prioritize the highway is like a love how these all of a sudden ... everything's crumbling we need this money we're not going to be able to get to work because the roads are going to be in in horrible shape in the fear tactic they're\nIt's a fascinating it's fascinating to see a right now it was polling or that the repeal was not doing as well but I think part of that now is because the way the um the prop is worded is really confusing and they take\nGreat pride in being able to mess people's heads up with propositions that people don't understand so the word in one way and they get to misrepresent\nThe vote so it'd be interesting to see the polling but I'm against uh I I mean I'm I'm for repealing the gas tax because when you look at the budget and you look where the money's being spent I think they're\nFeed have to be held to the fire in the sense that you can't just keep asking people for more and more and more because there is going to be more of an exodus\nFrom California it's ... it's becoming untenable to live here and um and then just in the city look what they've done was trashed costs look what they've done but if it costs on on everything related to the city how it's being managed right now\nUm and look at the job they're doing with fixing the pipes the broken pipes look at the DMV how it's being run by the state I mean it's it's it's pretty nuts you can you can make a lot of changes by being more effective instead of just saying\nMoney money money money money so uh I think more calls on this I there's other stuff to talk about to um there's Rosen's red roses and the uh the deputy attorney general just flew with the president on to a meeting that he had I forget what the meaning is I'll look it up\nBut nevertheless suppose that a good talk and it's as if nothing happened uh Leslie no threats about him being a\nThrown out of there for saying he's going to take the president and saying that he's going to the president is not a sit in mind apparently the president believed him when he said no I Would never say anything like that and remember\nRemember will give you might take back on why the president and Rosenstein are closing up right now while he
