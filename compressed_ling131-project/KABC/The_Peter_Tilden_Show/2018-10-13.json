if you can scores of passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money is the market's going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people playing out of the market's going somewhere either could go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it is\nMatter of your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond chart gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now imagine that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy her you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection early ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they can create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education where was your stock picking class where was how to balance a checkbook class writes a lot of the checkbook right\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that that's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to is up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a

tuning you miss Larry Jacobs director of instructor development in ... structure it online training to be really shuts of life on can just turn to the market is one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow and in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's a supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to rebuild this is the primary source of income is a great\nRide you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy\nThinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be\nJust coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAnother student says ... al ... and ... and that's something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for that had a chemical or start a that changed my life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot

if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of instructor of element and top instructor it online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of income we talked\nA little bit about passive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same that that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because ... and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing it bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we were going to break that\nKind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck when we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right naturally that point you were getting at a before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people make you think you'd do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week one of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years for another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of her students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is well I got the mortgage I've got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach your students right out of the gate\nThat if they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYeah and you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big ups in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you've got about a fifty percent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty St yep same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was\nFourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\nIt's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves instead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now the fluid at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed\nWith lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now goes down through twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat might dust off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding as whites real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said visit you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations they just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake I use these bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mind around\nIt it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or\nActions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and hey for completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal that we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really take it's really a retirement account generate more income and side of the market's really live that life the drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional inside her kid makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always liked to say and I said earlier on the shows doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags in bags loads of view of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if your coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes oh\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you say we do another giveaway

probably so and that's what he's\nWell he's probably right or the other difference though was that in the civil trial OJ was required to testify he did not testify in the criminal trial and his

Jim subject on the table today is the press and the judicial system\nYears ago I worked in news in San Francisco on the radio and I was there for several breaking stories or when they happen to them when they came across the a P wire as a matter of fact uh one was the Johnstown story the other was the Dan White story a and a as a reporter\nYou have a mix of emotions and you just incredulous\nYou are absolutely excited and galvanized a you feel the weight on your shoulder of reporting this story correctly for you the first big story that you covered was Robert if Kennedy being assassinated what was that like for you\nIt was horrible um it was a unexpected I I was in the ... bureau that night my I was very young I was just starting out as the ... and the bureau and uh my ship started at midnight him slim as much as he was yeah and he was killed at twelve o five\nAnd it was very emotional it was you know everybody who came in who had been on the road with him are reporters had been traveling with them they were all coming in and tears I mean he was very much loved but the the priority for everybody\nWants to get the facts find out who this guy was that had shot him find out where everyone was at that moment\nGet all the details I mean our report about Thomas was incredible he was practically on top of Kennedy might have happened if he'd been any closer he would have been shot and they had the presence of mind to get to a phone and call in\nAnd that's the main thing you you put everything else aside and you just go with the story\nI was a kid lawyer I was there that night uh you know I mean I I was at the ambassador\nAnd I remember them yelling out one of the reporters let's not have another Oswald\nThey were running around and to me is I think of my wife of various moments of my life than men that you'll never forget and I mean that that was definitely one of them without a doubt yeah that was extraordinary and then to see\nYou know that family what had happened over the years I mean you lose your weight and oh\nAll of the stories that I've done in the past seemed to be coming back it's like everything all the new again uh I mean I've been writing things on I wrote a story lesson\nWe're on the four days anniversary of the Manson killings and I was up to the prisons for the last parole hearing of Suze ... before she died I've been doing Polanski which is one of my old cases a Michael Jackson of course has come back with the events after his death\nUm it seems like the major cases that I've done in the past will never go away they're part of my DNA almost\nBut ah but they keep repeating not only does but similar ones right has a sense that young a young person to five years in jail the son of a major Hollywood production yesterday you know I mean\nIt's it's interesting yeah yeah ah and I don't know if the fame goes with the problems or\nWe just know about their problems who don't know about the other problems but it is it is\nYeah it was very sad that was cameras Douglas\nYeah right yeah and then he had spoken openly about anti drugs and so forth his father had yes they're they've had issues and so forth and [noise]\nBut it's a rip your heart out in the one thing is to be involved in something like that and then the next thing the thing is even worse because you see it all over the press\nRight right but you know I think that um the the public is interested in these things because they think that it could happen to them and then this instructive particularly a case like that for parents that have young young kids\nAnd you know how could someone who is the heir to such a wonderful Hollywood name and you know a fortune\nHow could he get involved in this I'm the public when you were reporting on a case what is your thought of me I Am\nI Am thinking that I Am your eyes and ears in the courtroom I\nAm there to give you every detail to try to have ice in the back of my head so I can see what's going on in the courtroom as well as what's going on the witness stand and and then the front of the well the courtroom uh I'm there as an observer I'm there as a chronic color of\nHistory because I Am ... convinced that most of the trials I Do which are very big trials\nAre mirrors of what's going on in society at the time and if you think back on things like the Manson trial which was the trial of the sixties the trial of flower power hippies celebrities Sen drugs\nUm that was one but there have been so many others that have social implications for all of us\nThe Menendez brothers' case which was really the first we had heard a of allegations of but a child sexual abuse within families\nUm the Patty Hearst case which was really the the post Vietnam Era in which young people came back disenchanted and\nDid terrible things including kidnapping her um and how she reacted in that case had so many social implications her father was forced to give away food and food give away in the streets",
