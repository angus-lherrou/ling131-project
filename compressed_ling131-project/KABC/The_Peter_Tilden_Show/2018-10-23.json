Republicans are good at saying\nNo what what's really happening here is that the Democratic math is off and Democrats are garbage and everything basically when President Trump in the second thing and then you had to have very good thing for Republicans when he's the first thing in the news it's a problem so and Democrats than weeks\nDemonstrating they don't care about the process and that they will railroaded by simply for political reasons they're the Republican when the lead headline in the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats setting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for Republican when the lead headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz at a restaurant\nAnd screaming at him and his wife very good for Republicans the best friend up Republicans right now\nIs the intensity of the Democrats and you are seeing that full scale in the polls also obviously you're seeing the effect of a very good economy on the Republican the margin by which voters trust Republicans or Democrats when the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling really say are plus Seventeen and the polish an amazing also\nI don't want to give credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good thing number one is taking proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the president of the United states does make it feel like he has he changed actor\nAnd usually in midterm elections there is an attempt to vote for change right now what the polls show is that Republicans are actually seen as the party of change well being the party in power that's really unusual usually the party out of power is seen as a party of chain but because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he is the guy who's sitting in the state\nThat is very good for Republicans but here is what the latest polls show according to the wall Street Journal voter interest in the mid term elections has surged to record within both parties helping to drive up President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democratic lead as a party most preferred to lead Congress according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News news poll\nFindings point to an energized electorate buffet in by dynamic to bring great uncertainty the outcome of an election\nJust two weeks away and what the polls kind of show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters Troy high level of interest in the election that has the highest ever recorded in a midterm election since the journal NBC poll began asking the question in two thousand six\nNow the reason for that is because largely Democrats than I Do cross we're always going to be energized vote against President Trump but now Republicans are are really mobilized vote against the Democrat I Know that my interest in voting\nPeaked significantly thanks to the Democrats behavior during the Brett Kavanaugh saga and I know that most of the Republicans\nFeel the same the once large gap between Republican voters and Democrats voters interest in the election has now been close sixty eight percent of Republican voters in Seventy two percent of Democrats\nSay they are very interested in the election that is the highest recorded for either party by the survey in a midterm election also President Trump's Trump's job approval rating has jumped to forty seven percent according to the wall Street Journal\nNBC News poll that has the highest mark he had ever had in office\nIn that poll he's no higher than President Obama's average pull approval rating before the two thousand in elections now is worth noting that President Obama got skunk and the two thousand ten election\nBut with that said President Trump has gained significant approval only forty nine percent disapproval so that's about as close to parody is Trump is ever going to get he's never going to be a fifty five percent president he's just too polarizing figure forty seven percent for President Trump\nIs a very good number and that is a reelection number if he gets up to forty seven percent public approval ratings he wins reelection and twenty twenty that's an improvement from September that's what forty four percent approved and fifty two percent disapproved of his performance and then Democrats decided it would be a great idea to shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly with and they are Fifteen\nThe freedom to go to any medical provider you want and saved thousands on your healthcare starting today license advisors are standing by to take your call but you must act now call us at eight and ...

border crisis at this at this point I'd love to hear your take on this because you reach statistics as overall illegal immigration has been as historic lows the last several years except you see images of thousands of people heading toward the United states\nAnd uh we're discussing our issues and you're going great\nMore more folks coming in except that you gotta realize a lot of these folks can be stopped at the border\nAnd a lot of these ... all of these folks are going to be detained and questioned and they're going to be seeking asylum and they're going to be processed and I think Seventy five eighty five percent are usually turned away and the Trump Administration is trying to make it even tougher to get in so it will curtail the numbers coming in\nUm immigration from Mexico by the way just as an update has been falling but from Central America because their economy is doing a little bit better\nUm but the other economies in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador Central America much higher than it was a decade ago the say based on record\nViolence political instability and those are the primary factors that are driving Central Americans to the United states the current ... is unusual in science except that there are other caravans that don't get this kind of attention and the reason that the folks traveling caravans is to protect from\nExtortion and rape and other dangerous along the journey 'em and they don't have to hire a smuggler for thousands of dollars and it's organized by certain groups that take them over the ... is the largest to date there were about twelve hundred\nThat had media coverage in the spring as you remember um many will not as I said be granted asylum it's because it's illegal to show up at a U.S port of entry and request asylum\nBut getting it you got to demonstrate a credible fear of persecution based on religion nationality political opinion or membership in\nParticular social group and as we know it can take weeks even months just to be allowed to enter the U.S ports of entry and we do know that there are some of these folks are going to rush the border or most of these going to voluntarily\nUm admits and sit down for the interview and a and B process between the two thousand twelve to thousands Seventeen immigration judges denied about Seventy five percent\nOf the newly eleven thousand asylum cases brought by Guatemalan immigrants just so you know that um and then of course there may be separation\nOr the Trump Administration with zero tolerance to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally resulted in separation which of course that triggered the outrage that came\nIn in June the government's scrap that policy but that doesn't mean family separations will necessarily and so we've got this immigration issue with huge\nUm and there are a lot of issues within this one issue they're they're the reason that immigration is so difficult\nThe questions or how should the United states treat illegal immigrants that's one of the questions especially if you brought to the country's children that's one should overall immigration levels be reduced increased or neither\nAnd how should the u._s. prioritize the various groups whether they're refugees are family members or economic migrants or skilled workers seeking to enter the country so you got a lot of levels of questions to ask not just what do we do about overall about immigration so I guess the bigger question is\nAre we doing something to actually address\nIllegal immigration or are we just using it as a wedge issue which seems to work um but we really want to want to curb illegal immigration\nAnd do what's necessary and again it's tough because it's multi level this multi tiered it's not so easy and that always brings me up to the question of e verify if you're really interested in doing\nIn curtailing immigration you got to get to the root of the problem with a gracious why people are leaving other countries and the question is are looking\nFor jobs so if you in for Steve are fine we talked about this before Ninety percent of companies are not involved in ...\nIf you made it mandatory new punished those companies it would seem to me that that would curb a lot of\nIllegal immigration and as a matter of fact some folks were here wouldn't leave if the jobs when available so you got the Democrats who rely on Latinos his constituency you you have the Republicans who rely on them for work you have of course labor farm labor\nThat lobby opposes the any kind of measure with e verify 'cause forms rely on migrant laborers\nAnd the the department of labor estimates what almost fifty percent of farm workers\nAre gotten through that that kind of labor so both sides are kind of guilty\nOf pushing the son wrote I've been talking about illegal immigration since then I got to the station in Eighteen or for so\nWe keep talking about the issue also you've talked about cutting aid to those countries okay she'll threaten those countries of Central American nations and it sounds okay yeah you should take care of your people so we're going to cut aid except that that could lead to more migration to the United states and even a a major\nHead of homeland security at one point said that it's smart it's prudent to spend money to aid those nations\nTo keep the situation from boiling over so that we won't be flooded with folks who want to escape or a bad environment and who was that person that would be John Kelly who said that\nNot more than two years ago so you're looking to get aid also if you give aid to other countries you have the ability to influence their policies are including investments like a counter narcotics operations and other operations that\nMay not be top priority for them which yields a benefit us but it sounds counterintuitive it sounds like why should punish them\nAnd that's gonna that's going to solve the problem when that may be a good investment and now you're starting to see why this is a bigger issue and it's a tough issue\nA and it's a multi tiered issue and you can't just simplistic way you look at it and go oh here's here's the thing we should do you need to do lots of different things and there's no guarantee what's going to yield the best result\nAside from the fact in this country we've always a welcome immigrants who came here legally\nUm as far as far as the aging of the ... of this country economists are saying you need more young workers to help pay into the system for all workers so those are all the things all of the issues have to juggle and when you bring up the term illegal immigration but right now it seems to be working\nFor the president focusing on this caravan um and it looks like the party is engaged because of this issue so I'd love to hear your take on it and then just laid out some of the parks to this puzzle\nBut I'd love to hear your thoughts eight hundred to two to five to two and what's going to motivate them in terms of gambling and see in the morning\n[noise] I get to tell you how much I Love your show and like every single crank language yeah I must tell you that this is an invasion\nOf people are kind of a feather this Swedish meat or trying to break into our borders we can't have that\nCountry I live what happened you\nKnow you have to have a locate I'm right with you so what do we do how do you deal with this\nWell we definitely tried and tried to opt out of the tree and the way\nThat you're OK with funding with with not cutting funding to those countries to to keep in the world are increasing\nInto their country and they were cutting off funding to your country because of that year and if you want to thank you skate Kenya you go let me see if they are for their own\nBut here's the deal when you ... if you tell us an asylum seeker that you're cutting the government funding it's not going to them anyway it's going to their government that's not going to relate nothing look the family separation didn't deter this the caravan correct\nNo it didn't and they they let a white mother let their minor child go I go up hills and travel allowed what kind of well\nAgain these are folks who are in such dire straits and I can't you can't painted with a a big rush because their individual stories but most of them\nAre will do anything to get out of the situation there in which is why you risk that kind of journey while you risk that kind of journey with babies and young adults et cetera\nIt's so horrible where they are that they're willing to do anything that said the country just can't open its its borders and say hey everybody come on and so there'll be process but what do we do to eliminate this like I said\nWhat everything I'm hearing an expert you're talking about is you want to fund those countries\nTo help to make those countries a little more livable so these people aren't going to be linked to help them with their drug problem to help them with our gang problems or they're going to show up at our borders and by the way\nI'm guessing that most of the population that's coming up here is not going to try to evade captured the border so they're going to actually surrendered when they crossed the border\nWhich is different from pre twenty fourteen when it was Mexican nationals trying to\nEvade U.S officials this is mostly folks coming your organization of aid capture turned themselves in and ask for asylum\nWe're trying to process them in time we're trying to do the right thing but again is is a political problem is is a problem that both parties need to resolve because I've been talking about illegal immigration as long as I've been at the radio station\nAnd I think we have a favorite\nThe radiology technologist nurses' aides and other patient care workers want to six percent raise you see offering half that at three percent pay hike\nAt a campaign rally last night in Texas President Trump blamed Democrats

second look vine which is why we have to see a voice so there you go back to the immigration\nIssue and the caravan and the president is using it as a wedge issue um for the midterms and use it it's funny he's very smart\nAnd understanding what at least his base and maybe even independent voters are concerned with or how to make it a concern and he realized the tax cut was not something that was going to resonate\nSo number one you said ah we're going to give another tax cut to the middle class which indicates that the other tax cut the interest of resonate as a mid term\nUm topic that would drive people out and then there's immigration the immigration debate has faced with this carbon and use brilliantly using its\nTo rally the GOP the base and maybe some independence but it may also rallying some Democrats to come out so we won't know a next time we're going to talk to some experts about what to look for in the election which is only two weeks away but first let's go to Andrew in

Republicans not enforced e verify\nThat we don't want to do it because it's going to hurt\nAnd the Democrats are doing it because they want they see the the country they stand was because they want to vote so there you go so we're going to be talking about this immigration really correcting the problem forever and just using it as an issue to motivate people on either side it either election are we going to try and actually do something humanitarian\nHelp so these folks don't have to do what they're doing and make this cross that's dangerous with their families that it's it's insane you're not going to have the same conversation years from now\n\nYeah I just think that uh these people I mean that coming across the border because they got they got side they got bad government\nWe're ... and also it seems counterintuitive studies shut out his studies show that if you help those governments which obviously they're poor and the problem is going on there that will ultimately help us a there is a cost to it but then there's a cost to not helping them you have to weigh that which is why this gets to be complex it's not that simple\nWhy don't we just cut up the plots at the airport like I said nobody talked about that anymore but it's fifty percent of our illegal\nAliens come into the air and overstay nobody's talking about that\nAnd over so well because this is an issue that has it's a visual issue it's an emotional issue or it's a divisive issue and then as I as I started you don't really want to to to look at immigration\nAs more than good or bad you ... but when you do you look at well All right what about what about the kids that are brought here you have to address that issue\nWhat do we do with the levels of immigration is a good to reduce them in Greece them neither and how do we prioritize who's coming over whether the refugees their family members economic migrants skilled workers um how do you break that down so we have good policy so I think what I'm saying and I think what you're saying is\nWe haven't chosen to address those issues realistically so we're we're in the same place we always are\nWhere we have this kind of issue it's politicized and yet we don't get to the real root causes will you do you agree with that or disagree\n[noise] well I just had to say I think we have to let it capable here already just drives a false five and I think I was a deliberate oh we have to lake table we've got to stop the ...\nWell the other part of immigration is going to be this if you are truly bringing folks who are not skilled\nThis country is moments away from losing thousands and thousands of jobs because there's going\nTo be automation is already happening whether its customer service whether if you go into the McDonald's and you use the kiosk such technology is going to is going to definitely take away a lot of jobs so if you have folks coming are not trained\nTo do jobs and they're coming for low lower wages and those jobs are slowly not even existing we're gonna have a problem not only with their own country and I see the Germany's is training their kids the next generation sixty percent of getting training tech\nWe have five percent that are getting training in touch and then you're bringing folks\nWho have no training and you're you're really going to be importing poverty and the huge way and you're not gonna have the jobs like we did in the last week with immigration with our parents when you had manufacturing jobs up towards you and you can place folks in manufacturing jobs and other jobs they those jobs don't exist and and some of the low wage jobs that we have now\nReally really soon you know self driving cars are not out of fifty years out they could be eight to ten years out but all customer service you're going to be talking to a lecture or the equivalent of a lecture and every time I say that I probably just turned on two hundred um but yeah it's different so immigration is going to be different\nThis the the the country's gonna look different with that technology and we're going to have issues with that and they're only talking just why do you keep hearing universal income\nFor our country because it's going to displace quite a few people um who are not going to be able to get jobs who are born and raised here who are trained for the wrong thing this is why when I see parents whose kids now are taking sociology I go ... ... what are you going to open a little sociology shop on Ventura board\nSo the concern is there are coming up as I said we're going to talk for a moment about Mr ... because it now it seems like a top aide to the crown prince\nActually ran the killing of ... by giving orders over you're ready for this guy\nAnd this could show the killing of apparently this gentleman was present as he has been neither are the key moments of the crown prince was administration they're saying it was virtual or any big into ... insulted ... over the phone according to our him in Turkish sources and by the way\nI should mention remember with or the one in Turkey who you're dealing with their true and how they're putting out this information to benefit\nThem that's not saying he's making stuff up\nBut they're not integrate situation when it comes to the Saudis and the fighting for dominance in the middle east so always put an asterisk next to that when you hear that uh there are no one is given the information or the Turkish sources giving the information but according to the urban Turkish sources 'cause she'll get answered the questions by this gentleman was insults of his own\nBut he was no match for the squad which included top security and intelligence operative somewhat direct links to the real court a Turkish intelligence source related at one point this gentleman tiny told his mental disposal to shrug you bring me the head of the dog the Turkish intelligence source those\nInteresting thing that I'm Mr everyone gave the announcement and the timeline but he didn't go after the prince I don't even think he mentioned the princes name because I think somebody sit back down to weaken down a notch\nAnd didn't bring up the tape that he has which was kind of odd because he's been talking about the fact that they have a tape of the killing and supposedly the audio tapes and see how you heard but there were supposedly more tapes that were deeply incriminating this is saying by the way the new report from turkey says it was definitely\nA hundred percent premeditated so uh we're going to be talking about that or we're going to give you quite a few more points on that and also I Want to focus at the top of the hour which these shepherd campaigns that are for political on what the campaigns are shaping up to be is there a blue wave\nOr if if there is why if there is not why not and as the sushi that we're talking about though is is motivating turnout also immigration issue in his help you're going to motivate on the left\nSo we'll have time for all of that and of course we'll take your calls eight hundred to two to five to two and I will do that as a matter of fact when we return next talk with your seven Ninety KBC\nAre you

time my wife I'm actually engaged now and I'm an gauge I'm finding out that the party betrayed me\nWell to to answer your first question um it's very hard to get young folks on the phone [laughter] yeah I was looking\nI happen to be be working on this I'm a story today about Virginia so I'm looking at this one poll and in northern Virginia congressional district right the New York times published where they called\nThree thousand nine hundred and twelve phone numbers that they were they according to the voter file belong to vote registered voters Eighteen to twenty nine years old and they were able of the nearly four thousand they were able to interview forty one of them\nWhile so now do they how do they waves which is\nYeah nearly you know close to a one percent success rate\nTo um that's I mean this is it it's\nBarry difficult now the other thing that's also true though is that\nYounger voters historically don't turn out in mid term elections in high numbers um especially compared to voters and other age cohorts and there are some questions this year if you look at the polls 'em and you ask people if they intend to vote or more people basically across\nThe board by demographics say they intend to vote but there is a particularly notable increase among younger voters and it's not just\nThe typical oh more younger voters say they're going to vote and will do it is more younger voters say they're going to vote this time than in previous mid term elections a you know and twenty fourteen if fifty percent of ... of young voters that they were going to vote and thirty did this time it's Seventy five say they're going to vote so how many are going to do is it going to be thirty again\nRight probably not it's probably going to be an increase but but to what degree and I think that's that's driving a lot of the uncertainty we have right now\nDo they have I read about the president's war room where he is pretty download the staff I assume\nThey're all over this and when he you know I read that he surprised his own party by coming out saying I'm going to do a tax cut for the middle class and people were shocked and not prepared for that\nWhere does he get his I mean he's got a good got about what resonates with his base a where does he get his analytics and he's also got Kellyanne Conway who ran analytics firm who's working\nWell yeah the the RMC um does a lot of polling that's presented to ah the president and members of his political staff or including Kellyanne Conway they\nThe president is also an avid consumer of um television news and so he gets a lot of information from there um as you may have heard and I think he has latched onto the narrative\nThat I'm Republicans aren't necessarily winning the messaging war around the tax bill they passed last year and the Democrats attempt to to convince voters that most of the benefits as\nThey actually do most of the benefits of the law go to wealthier Americans or to corporations um has prompted this call for a middle class an additional middle class tax cuts and I'm obviously\nYou know he says Congress is going to introduce that next week Congress is not going to be here next week right um they won't be back until after\nThe elections nothing is going to happen until\nAfter the elections and the odds of something happening in a lame duck Congress ah except for what Congress ... absolutely has to do is just on the ferment are kind of slim however\nUm I think it's an it's an ... it's a recognition of the fact that um they haven't necessarily won the messaging war around the tax bill that passed last year and that maybe he would want to do things a little bit differently moving forward\nSo if that's the case in the prison sensing that he sees the hum Caribbean can be something that can motivate during the midterms the Democrats have been\nKind of silences for silence or an answer back to that and what do you see across the country in different races is their messaging is there a unified message are they using healthcare are they using you're going to you're going to lose your pre existing conditions are not going to be covered or what what are there other messages that are going up\nSo I think in most of those districts that is a health care you know voter say up there with the economy those are issues number one and two in either order um this is a an opening that that that might we saw all throughout last year in the healthcare debate that\nBoth the Affordable CARE Act and certain provisions as it became more popular as Republicans were inching toward repealing the law and a Democrats are using that as an opening to particularly since ... almost all Republicans voted in the house to repeal it and move to build up the Senate\nThey're using this as a\nUm as an attack line or in almost every race across the country I Do think also some some Democrats particularly in some of the uh suburban seats where that turned against Donald Trump and Republicans and twenty sixteen are using the idea of being a check and balance on the administration\nA as a a a selling point as for the caravan um this is interesting I I'm not sure Democrats have decided on a a response I'm not sure that all Democrats feel like they need one\nUm it seems given the way that the president has sought to uh talk about this selling it at the same time as a democratic conspiracy to have these folks\nWork their way up from Central America in October of an election year if it's such an asset for him to talk about it that's why we're Democrats somehow or\nGoing to have the exact come nowadays you know it it makes little logical sense when you think about it that way\nUm and there's obviously absolutely no evidence that this is some sort of democratic conspiracy uh but I Do think there are some folks who think they should talk about it and try to talk about the ways in which I'm the president has lived up to some of his promises on immigration I think there are others who think that a lot of the immigration\nLanguage and the campaign trail is sort of baked in and that it behooves democratic candidates to stick to their core messaging which is which has been health care like\nI said you know as you bring that up and talking to Steve Shepherd campaign editor for political ... it's interesting with the garbage and get a caller last hour who said hey wait a minute there probably is not the pregnancy and a lot of the judge ships governorships the house and Senate fix it while you're telling us it's somebody else's fault fix it you said when you get in office you're fixing\nThe debt marching the Democrats and they try to fight\nTrump on his own terms and attack Elizabeth Warren ... going to score points by proving that she was one one millions or whatever that was and it failed miserably how are they going to attack back\nIn in this type of cycle are you seeing on these um these grassroots campaigns in different states are they fighting back or they'd be coming in many trumped\nIn other words being defiant and it's been doubling down or is it not working I mean with with Warren obviously didn't work\nUm [noise] I I don't know that you're necessarily seeing it a lot in some of these midterm campaigns but where I'm going to be looking for the stylistic\nDifferences is once we get past November six and start to look at the emerging democratic presidential field right um\nI think that um [noise] you know\nThere is there's going to be a contrast between some of the candidates and how they intend to quote unquote take the fight\nRight President Trump and I think some of them are going to be Elizabeth Warren has been pretty aggressive [noise]\nUm I think there are other Democrats who are going to want to be a calmer voice um and that's going to be an interesting contrast obviously the field is going to be so large there are just going to be two camps here uh and everyone's going to try to find a way to distinguish themselves\nUm in such a crowded field but that is one thing that I'm going to be watching closely\nYeah who who takes the other thing too that must be interesting from you and for you it's interesting for me watching it in campaigns with just twenty four hour news cycle\nWhere something seems seems like it's going to be a huge event\nAnd it's going to motivate people and people are gonna care and it's going to resonate it drifts off after one day and you you look back and go do that even did that even was that a a bump does that help anybody hurt anybody we're moving so fast and furious\nThat to try and land on something as a campaign issue that resonates for more than a minute and a half must be really tough\nAnd the things that have been enduring\nUm when you look at the survey data have been health care and the economy uh those have been the most enduring issues over the last two years\nSince the twenty sixteen election and um I think that is what when we look back at a what happened on November six those are going to be there to a big issues and and the reasons why either\nUm Democrats made major gains Republicans limited their losses or somewhere in between are going to be health care and the economy obviously healthcare is an issue where a voters favor Democrats by wide margins the economy is an issue that tilts toward Republicans given um the continued\nEconomic growth uh since President Trump was inaugurated in January twenty Seventeen so so I I think that the rest of these are have mostly been blitz on the writer\nBefore it goes the many surprises that you're seeing looking at all these different races because you look you're looking much deeper into the most people do\nWell look there are going to be lots of surprises on the site of November six there always are um there are a couple of um [noise]\nNow a high ranking GOP congressman who represents northern the LA county part of Kern County uh searching for answers after his office was vandalized house\nMajority leader Kevin McCarthy took Instagram last night saying someone talks to Boulder through the window of his Bakersfield often you

don't want to turkey and again it is kind of interesting sort of get his microphone and talking about a journalist who was killed in all of this um this outrage about journalism ... which by the way there should be that a journalist who's trying to expose corruption\nIn the country gets killed by the country but you are to one if you check into ... ...\nUh in Turkey leaving the journalist so great either they disappear they have accidents they get killed so you want to process this through a prism where you realize that there is an intense from um his administration in Turkey\nTo present this in a way that is a is it makes it look as bad as possible okay not to these events didn't happen not that it's not horrendous not that journalists all over the world now are having a worse it's a worse time and we need journalist to expose\nThe stories they're working on a and keep governments in check so it's concerning for that reason but again you're when you're dealing with\nA turkey Mm great uh and how much can you trust them so just just realize what that what that the what are the one is trying to do here too but supposedly according to him the day before the sugars killed a team of three Saudis arrived in Istanbul\nOn a charter flight and settled into a hotel or a team from the consulate carried out a reconnaissance mission and do good and uh the low over forest where they allege you may have been ...\n... did they show that he was killed twelve more Saudis arrived in this than bone and two groups one of three and another nine and a larger group included generals or before the show he's arrival at the constantly on October second the security cameras in the building where just connected\n... hence are the ones saying this was a premeditated murder\nThe Saudis deploy a body doubles which we heard about yesterday and CNN and some other networks were running the footage\nOf Africa show get various locations around Istanbul which would also um be premeditated you can't just say oh wow guy looked like him just happen to show show up that day and changed close with him um the report is that the body double left the conflict by the ... or about Ninety minutes after her sugar arrived\nAfter Saudi Arabia admitted its involvement in the killing and again remember the story has changed and changed and change and they're quite a few questions that can be asked like who gave them the orders\nThey mentioned is local collaborator who took the body where is that the changing stories why but after they admitted their involvement in the killing ... are the ones that Eighteen people had been arrested in Saudi Arabia\nThe Fifteen previous you identified as having flown in and the three other constantly staff\nAre Irwin said an independent investigation could not be held in Saudi Arabia and demanded that suspects be tried in Turkey\nHe added that the Vienna Convention offering diplomatic immunity was a matter of debate in the case my other my other point about this about not only whereas the body who gave the order et cetera\nWhen you have a crime scene that has not been scan for or weaker to how good is that crime scene you we watch CSI so the crime scene has been compromised when they by the time they let turkey and the check the crime scene a whole lot of time has gone by\nUm the weird thing is that other one didn't mention anything about the recordings that allegedly exist that supposedly RCA has heard didn't come up\nGiven didn't give details as time about her contribute died except that he said it was ferocious I'm a Turkish official told the new times at one of the Saudis arrived with a bone so we've been hearing that and he didn't mention crown prince Mohammed bin Salman by name referring only to the Saudi king\nSo it's interesting what he didn't say in his address and interesting what he did say in the address and where this is going to go a according to\nThe Washington Post today a top aide to the crown prince supposedly ran the killing but giving orders over Skype which some new information and that this guy was beamed into the room with the Saudi constantly via Skype insulting to show to show you insulted him back\nAnd then the squad that was there which included top security and intelligence operatives some was\nAllegedly direct links to the real court um were involved in this guy was giving orders names Khatami told his men to dispose of the show gate and said bring me the head of the dog according to Turkish intelligence sources so the story is changed and changed and changed", "show_name":
