Americans is actually the dwelling on the bin Laden began\nTo think what I'm about to shell proactive step had gone to the case in the day before\nI associated with diverse individual targeted day we went out to all kinds of elected official\nMedia outlets are television on back round the clock at Rutgers covered here in the mail rehab NYPD personnel present showing them what we look like and what to be on the lookout [noise]\nSo uh [noise] at this point are we are talking with\nOther FBI field offices the J ... about other incidents that are unfolding and other places but suffice it to say here is\nThat an individual for individual sends out multiple similar packages\nOr we have been working with corporate partners and the private sector we're prepared a product to the NYPD shield program\nWhich goes to [noise]\nPractically twenty thousand of our private security partners are instructing them on what to look for what the characteristics are and a renewed tips on on Hamlin was\nAt this point or at a very early stages investigation\nThis is being led by the joint terrorism task force here in New York City or the FBI the NYPD we've had it just didn't see a movie or state police were part of that as far as I Am but this is from a bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms or it's a big group on\nThe incident here today or wants to package was discovered emergency service was notified\nThey called the bomb squad [noise] Saddam's squad was able to safely removed a device contained in that ...\nUsing the total containment vessel PCB or in simple terms the bomb truck that has gone through a range of Rodman ... where FBI\nSpecial agent bomb technicians will work with are people on how to get it to the ... which should be the FBI lab so all of this evidence can be damaging to gather\nThere is an additional issue\nWhich is being worked on now\nWhich is within the package that can handy suspects the device\nA some kind of powder\nThat's being tested now downstairs so the mail room area there'll be contained while we go through\nThe various steps to um\nSets that are on a field test\nPackage it upsets me for removal I'm envious on that area and anybody who came into contact\nFirst new safeguards keeping modern ...\nWhich still aren't going\nTo take some questions it's not going to be able to go to the bachelor\nCan be outed by the way that the bomb has been constructed so um it it's interesting the other thing about this in in watching it this morning watching it unfold\nThe actual addressing CNN was not the actual mailing address for CNN or the other thing is that John Bolton was package was not a he's just not working at sea any words at MSNBC so they're saying there was a ... the level of sophistication\nWas not very hard however they are saying that all of these devices could work these were not devices that um we're in operative there put together in a way that they said that they they were actually active and could work in the fear now is to if there were other devices in the mail other devices being sent\nThat are innocent civilians people working in the mail business delivering meals cetera\nCould be a at risk here so the time one of the center huge building by the way it's two towers and I think they're fifty five story towers\nAre evacuated they're mixed use as much as the CNN was in there\nIt's that they were a commercial and residential\nWith shops with restaurants with grocery stores etc a job where we reaching out to ... to ... okay okay I'm just curious if we're getting a oh God oh he's coming on that one got 'em in any way so within forty eight hours this thing started and went from shore is George George says residents\nTo know midtown Manhattan in Florida I understand she tests and bomb\nThe b._b._c. news contributor is live from New York ... right there at the CNN do the more the morning how are you doing say\n...\nYou know you're you're dealing with a coyote now stand together yes I Am fine I can hear you so it's it looks like a lot of activity around there and we just heard I'm In ... say that the there was a bomb that was sent to his office so that was new information ... film was in and tell us what we need to know right now\nOr one of the interesting things about this is the NYPD had personnel in the mail room at the time Warner center or they were a teaching employees there what to look for in the wake of the packages that were sent to George Soros Hillary Clinton and Brock Obama\nWhen this package that was the address to former CIA ... CIA director John Brennan was discovered in that mail room so they were there at the time when it happened uh the alarm went off in the building we heard it live on the air as hobby Harlow and Jim shoot over on CNN anchoring the news reporting about the packages sent\nA intercepted uh that were sent to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama um my my colleagues who work at CNN uh we're all evacuated from the bureau I used to work there you know for seven years we used to routinely have these drills where that alarm would go off and we'd all evacuating\nOr one of the reasons we were doing that was for the possibility that the bureau could be targeted in some sort of attack it wasn't just a fire drill was all sorts of a scenario that we were prepared for and\nTo have it actually come to be realized a it is a real uh awakening moment for the people who work\nThere in Europe that are crowded area I mean you're in midtown Manhattan and as you as you hear Andrew Cuomo say a\nPackage was sent to me um at one point there saying New Yorkers should go about their day of course ... yet we're\nFinding out there are more and more packages that may be in a related I mean it looks like what you look for is commonality and right now the commonality is Democrats' progressive news organization because that's where you start where are they were they looking right now where they were they being deployed\nWell right now they're just comparing the similarities between\nThese different packages that were sent it started with one that was a sense of George Soros just a few days ago\nAnd his state in the hamlet of Bedford in Westchester which is about a forty miles give or take a few uh north of of New York city and then Hillary Clinton's home by the Clintons home or in chapel costs just ten miles away from Bedford so other they're pretty busy up there as well trying to trace the roots of these packages\nAnd also to see what they can find it that is common between the devices all of them out to see if that can lead them to one individual or or put them in one direction you know they want to look at what the devices were made of how they were put together what materials for used and possibly how they those materials were acquired and that could\nPotentially lead them down the road towards finding out who was responsible for this\nAt this point Steve were most of the packages male because if they were delivered you're looking maybe more than one individual\nIt it's not clear ah to to me whether they were all male through the U.S postal service or if there were some other sort of delivery service that was used\nWhether it was a career or UPS or you or or Federal Express the a package that was sent to Soros they said\nWas not sent through the U.S postal service but it was dropped off by an individual and put in the mailbox and they were following up on that but they didn't elaborate a they weren't able to say whether it was you know a different um delivery service or or a lone individual who did that\nThe other thing Steve that's that's intriguing if these were all sent two high profile individuals who all have security details this was not I mean George Soros I'm sure heavily protected uh cameras in detail Hillary and Bill Clinton or anybody on this list\nOf like I said high visibility the potential to for the bombs to be discovered is very high in that situation so you're looking at it and thinking maybe this is just to instill fear rather than the intent is actually to harm somebody even though they're active bombs\nAnd none of those bombs exploded none of them detonated a when they were discovered so uh that that's one thing to take notice as well and security at the time Warner center is extremely tight you have to pass through a a checkpoint at the front entrance and your packages has to be your bags or packages have to be get screened\nAnd you cannot go up inside the wrong if you haven't been pre approved so by someone who works there so and there's very very tight security there as well and the individuals who were targeted hear clearly they don't retrieve their own mail from their mailboxes and and as we learned\nOr their mail is screened by the secret service so that's how the packages were were discovered talking about Hillary Clinton of rock Obama George Soros is package was discovered by an employee after it had been placed in the mailbox outside his gated property [noise] also\nHoward these bombs be detonated were they would they be by shaking would they be was is there a detonating devices inside\nWe don't we don't have any information about the technical aspects of these bombs other than that they looked like pipe bombs that's all we know at this point\nAnd where do they removed and they get them out of the center of Manhattan because of the population base or were they take them to dismantle them and started doing the analysis\nThere's an NYPD range in the Bronx where they often take suspicious packages to a and safely detonate them or at a great distance and and we've seen this happen that we we've even seen them do demonstrations for us over the years\nAnd what does the noticed is going out to other high profile individuals who may be targeted because like I said the ... there's does seem to be initially a commonality um what's what's the structure there\nIs ... these are all people who were routinely vilified by people on the right to either by the president or supporters of the president for a number of reasons and uh that that's the commonality so far amongst all of these people who are targeted now\nThat's all we can say we don't know who did this we don't know what the motivation was we don't know what type of a person or persons this might have\nCome from we just know what that commonality is\nAnd the white Asian the white powder do we know what that was we don't yet know wild so and I guess you have all these coordinating forces look New Yorkers prepared for this on a daily basis of you've been to New York\nBecause of the city the weights laid out in because nine eleven um they put in practices since then and since the anthrax scare 'em to better better determine and better also segregate this away from the public correct and they've got new techniques since the anthrax scare on how to how to handle this and what the procedures\nYeah I mean do you remember after nine eleven or there were envelopes filled with anthrax sent to different newsrooms and some people died after opening those those letters are so they did um you know\nI asked these news outlets to take certain measures to protect their employees or through better uh facilities through better practices in their mail rooms\nTo uh you know take precautions against this sort of thing so um yeah there definitely is still an awareness of that in those types of institutions\nSo I didn't even if he was a Time Warner centers as it open or the ugly allowing people to go back and they are they doing the total sleep 'cause it's\nToo they are ours from what I can tell my or my colleagues at CNN are still out on the street I'm I just saw some of them are tweeting if they were still out on ninth avenue which is down the block\nAnd a this is not unusual that you know the uh the new practice for this they would occasionally do um uh drills where they would set up a bureau outside of the building they would use satellite trucks to prepare for a situation just like this so they can continue broadcasting until they're allowed back inside the building\nGod why thank you for the report on or will will calling me of course for updates you raised there and\nAgain during the press conference run a ... ... ... said that he received a package and I'm guessing we're going to be hearing more updates as we go on others who have been threatened or got packages are that are similar and then when push comes on the map the only one out of state so far I'm In New York was Florida at this point\nThat I'm aware of that yes it's been hard to keep up with all this news it's been unfolding very quickly but the the Debbie Wasserman Schultz offices are having been close is the only other incident that I'm I'm aware of their maybe others out there I don't know\nSteve thanks for the report and being in right there in the midst of it um of course his Twitter is at esque cost and mom a CBC newsgroups we're live right there in ...\nCity or at the scene so thank you for coming on was a ... if you want to comment on this uh eight hundred to two to five to two again we're just trying to Wade through this right now it's unsettling\nA and then figure out what to what to do next but right now you're trying to avoid speculating too soon the only reason we're bringing up the commonality is 'cause\nThat's what the task force ... we're going I'm an expert on next hour to talk about how you go about this is associate director of homeland security operational announces on your senior policy researcher uh Henry willows can give us some sense of how they go about this now and how to go about figuring out\nThe commonality here in

Obama and Hillary Clinton I'm Andrew Cuomo or colder George Soros\nOr if you're a director John Brennan uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz I think those are the ones that we know so far the concern is that it it keeps increasing and we just had a report of another one in the in the center and mail center in Maryland or Rob in Santa Monica good morning\nYeah I'm so a quick comment about Hillary Clinton before I get into the bombing she couldn't get two sentences and it allows destroying without being divisive\nShe starts saying we shouldn't be divisive and she goes right into being divisive the second thing is this week's of anti thought George Soros this is not some guy ended up on this is a well\nOr at least it question how do you know that right when when people I'm always fascinated by well you know not going to wait a minute I'm going to talk and you're going to wait a minute how do you know that when people\nCall and say then you have a view that other people don't necessarily disagree or agree with okay and there are people on the other side of issues\nWhen people call of a sudden and they have definitive information about something the FBI is investigating we're still in the midst of this people are in danger of their evacuating their city and you already know who this is that's pretty\nSilly like well no you said you said this is what it is\nIt leaks of this is a

well that's great I Wish you could do the investigation started and find out who you know what\nThe ... it's funny I said let's avoid speculating too soon and we're ten thirty nine on the day where they're still trying to to determine if there are other packages\nWho's at risk and he said the Hillary was divisive\nHere's somebody calling radio station to say this is what it is and it's a plot and as a left wing plot and let's now here goes hatred and venom and hatred and why do we wait to see what it is\nAnd who it is and who established that and maybe open our minds up a little regardless of which side of the all you're on to say let's get to how stupid is is let's just get the details and then of course then you have to be open to trust the details in today's politicized world\nAnd then you have to accept the details and move forward and make some judgments about it so I didn't see what Hillary Clinton said but I guess what the president will still be campaigning tonight\nAnd and yes people will use this to from for raising money because politics is really ugly and we have a midterm coming up in a couple of weeks but you know what at ten forty ... is still unfolding\nThe lack of objectivity is rare on on both sides of the aisle and everybody's got this bias blind spot and a lack of self awareness we can't stand back and go\nFor maybe I Am wrong or maybe I'm over the top on this or maybe I Am being too judgmental and maybe I should recalibrate how we're going to get the country to do that I don't know and look you look back you can look back to the the the first presidential campaigns it was it's always been ugly and the accusations and name calling\nBut it feels right now like it's gotten to a point where because of the Internet because you can find you can go into that echo chamber and be supported whatever and you know and feel so sure that you're right and the other guy is wrong that he's not just wrong\nHe should pay for being wrong he doesn't understand he's wrong and you're a hundred percent dug and so that's that's the difference I think that social media has played I'm a huge part in this uh used to be we're a little bit more\nWilling willing to say wow wow maybe maybe I Need some correction your course correction now anybody can find anything on the Internet to support them and there you go there on the one on good morning\nThis

national key word and Ninety five eight one\nOr your shot guns dollars\nHow much more\nOn ABC Los Angeles county cumulus station [noise]\nABC News live and local at eleven o'clock I'm Jeff will and the secret service has its intercepted\nPackages containing possible explosive devices that were sent to several high profile Democrats including former president rock Obama former secretary of State Hillary Clinton Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz New York governor Andrew Cuomo\nOr there might be ... like you said of the tracking of the package do they all come from the same place or not\nIt was also the mind of the investigators now they want to get into the mind of the person who sent it but of course they don't have much to go on so I guess you have to keep a really open mind and not closed parameters at all when you're looking at those correct\nYeah that's absolutely right going back to what we said earlier you you can't speculate ah and there is it do you want to not shut down any potential advantage are suspects and hopefully maybe some tips will come in and that's that's something that\nIs that generally is that generally happening again the Unabomber different example took quite some time butter tips usually where these things unfold\n[noise] ah ... we've done some work here at Iran to look at when attacks are foiled or one case the salt water the factors that proceed into it and chips eat at a law enforcement or through such suspicious activity reports are a\nVery productive way of giving law enforcement information and it comes back to the things like to see something say something campaign which which can be useful in and filing attacks\nAlso these devices are they immediately ... they they take them out of a population center of course I Want to get them away from folks are or were they can do the most damage or they immediately dismantled to see how they were built in trying to discern if\nThere's a bomb maker that whose fingerprint is on this and I don't mean little little little fingerprints\n[noise] yeah I I uh have to tell you I'm not certain of the actual tradecraft and tactics it will be used on that show that I had I Do understand that a law enforcement will look for clues but I Can't comment on the specifics of how they'll do that\nBecause it's such a ... I Know the president's going to make a copy commenting on this in the moment we're going to ... when that happens I'm gonna break away to that and they put you on hold for men so I wanted to let you what you know that that's coming out of so anything else that you see and I know not specifically on this Henry\nBut patterns when something like this happens I guess the biggest fear now is we got to find out who else these packages potentially were sent to how do you coordinate that\nWell that is a big question that pops into people's mind is is this an isolated event how what is the\nThe broad scale in nature and and can you figure that out without causing his little disruption as possible we we are seeing that officers are being in different places are being evacuated and\nAh there probably are are questions being asked about how safe is very different male routes are are going\nOr is it possible way no more it's difficult to say what we should do and no one has too much destruction\nSkip the Florida it's possible with any of these people who were targeted actually know the person who's sending it\nYou know\nIf if again keep all all pop options open a ... in the other events that has been one of them but you know this is a pretty broad group of people and uh you know people who would know sorrow send a bomb a high and et cetera and also want to send bombs to them is\nTo that point ... we we see that they're calling pipe bombs and want to ask you about the sophistication about as low level of sophistication\nHigh level on a pipe bomb um the timing that we're going into a midterm election as I said high profile people who would be protected um and again there's there's a scene here there's so many called up earlier and so this could be a ... that you're trying to mess with our election muscled our heads and that and so division\nUm is it harder to find that out in tracking if it is a foreign agent\n[noise] you know\nIt again you got to keep your mind open as to what the opportunities that what the\nMotivations and actors could be it's way too early to uh either roll out our specify what it is but perhaps when we see the devices it'll it could potentially give some clues based on the sophistication of the methods used\nAnd were set a pipe bomb is that a low level sophisticated type of bomb or you'd have to see it because a pipe bomb can be put together a number of ways\nYeah I I don't know enough of the details about what these devices are to be able to speculate as to if it says something about how sophisticated as in training you'd need in order to do that just haven't seen those details\nNow talking to Henry Louis associate director of homeland security operational now says center so as a layman I look at this of course it's upsetting it's confusing it's frightening um you don't have it be paralyzing as a professional who's been down this road this is what you do\nWhat when you saw this was when when you run up and you thought emotionally or how do you feel and where where does your head go\n[noise] well you know I think you've hit on an important point yeah if the motivation of this turns out to be terrorism we don't know yet right it the main the main uh an objective a terrorist is to cause fear and get attention\nAnd had a different whether that happens whether they're successful dependent on a number of things that the symbolic significance of ah\nWho they're attacking it seems like these are high profile and that that's why for example the world Trade Center was repeatedly targeting kind of it's symbolic significance how it plays out sometimes ... on a significant places but if innocence are targeting San Bernardino can really cost fear and and motivate people\nBut sometimes they don't have a little facts I think of the recent ah rice and letters that were set out and I don't think they caused big upswing of the right\nRight exactly right ... ... you're looking at this and and as I as I look at it so I ask you what your gut felt about this thing is I'm looking at it you wonder how paralyzing is going to be I mean the government got up and said you know we'll go about our business will keep doing what we do\nBut there's a cumulative effect of this for citizens who wins is repeated and threats are repeated\nUm it gets in your psyche and then and you start making judgments about stuff and it does close you down like ... ... group that caller's rules where they have an answer already they know what this is\nAn you've seen that proven wrong time and time again something looks exactly like\nThis and it turns out to be something completely different\nI think that's why it is really important to to not jump to conclusions my my first question that I look for is\nI Wonder who's doing this and why as I step through I I realize that\nThere are many reasons and it's sometimes more often than not it's it's one of those races in combination with something like mental illness I mean think about John Hinckley right who who are part of it you wanted to get Jodie Foster's attention\nAnd we would have never known that were if if if if for some reason that wasn't the determine because we couldn't couldn't find the guy and he got away whatever you would never know the correct\nAnd it would look like a political going it's interesting because I just flashing the fact that Osama bin Laden\nUm was it was always his intent or what what I heard was his intent was to so so much discord over here and and basically try and bankrupt the United states\nOr in into trying to prevent for another attack that we would go through such gymnastics and jump through so many hoops ... it could basically break the country financially\nAnd because of that of course all the screenings on airlines and and and metal detectors and colleges and speakers bureaus et cetera so use connecting or he was connected can monitor at least try to destroy the country\nBut he wasn't secret about that yeah let's see let that be known and that was part of the terrorists and plan that he was laying out so we will be looking for that maybe there'll be messages maybe it'll be groups maybe some of this will get laid out or not\nAnd how things changed today with social media ... different from before we we don't know how to reverse engineering of this because we're not looking at somebody specific social media um accounts because we don't know who that person is but his social media already entering\nA it already in one way if you've those of us have been paying attention have noticed um announcements on ... I Know what\nI got in ... a member going whole quickly and we'll come back and that's okay with you because of president about this big headline yeah and I want to hear what you have to say so I'm going to put you on hold for a minute\nUm and of course I'll take your calls and we'll give you updates were going to Henry roast associate director of homeland security operational now says center and senior policy researcher and professor party ran graduate school\nWho is working with homeland security of course uh the first lady speaking in the president's ... standing right by some uh will take it\nI'm even thinking about their family ... we cannot do those kind of the attacks and I strongly condemn or\nPut suicidal I'm grateful for the survey I said I had a law enforcement for oh they do on a daily basis to keep the faith\nAnd encourage people across the country it's just kind of over ... [noise] I Want to arrive come you could have I have a slap on the path they're defending Jason has made tackling oh the ...\nAnd more importantly to look ahead of the work steel to be done [noise]\nWe're here to talk about the continued to action that taking to combat the oh the I took the dynamic which my husband will talk about in a few minutes [noise] I must say I'm proud of our president and the where the being done in the White House and across so many agency so how\nEvan Bayh\nABC talk or your ... ABC of course we can keep you posted this morning and throughout the day as we get new information on these suspicious package some ... they're saying a pipe bombs that were sent to different locations locations are\nA couple of New York city the Clintons George Soros or Obama in Washington CNN in New York City Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida we no one went to a congressional a postal center in Maryland I'm and as this is this is playing out we don't have tons of information are credible information yet\nBecause this task force is a is right now getting into it with all the other parties as you heard the president's ... behind it\nOn and on top of this uh trying to discern more devices who else could be receiving these devices to keep them safe keep people delivering the devices in the mail because most of the male safe and also trying to figure out the commonality and trying to reverse engineer this as quickly as they can to figure out\nWho could have done this or what people could have done this or foreign entity um you know an American empty somebody with mental illness and agenda so there's a lot to go through as just as an act of active investigation right now because it's playing out so we keep you posted you want to talk about it happy to talk about an eight hundred to two to\nFive to to to do that right after the news talk\nRates among [noise] 'kay
