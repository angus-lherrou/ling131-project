{"content": "Yeah exactly so those are the those are the kinds of concerns that people need to take into account before they come forward with an accent and I think\nYou're right and the women we talk to and from low wage jobs are concerned about keeping their job right and they are under a certain kind of strange so\nVery often it takes them a while to even find a legal voice that will listen and keep them protected in their jobs very hard now there are so women's legal Defense Fund that was created as a reaction in part to the winds gene efforts\nWe've talked to with those folks about how women can't get access to those fines\nThey they have over twenty million dollars and they had had over three thousand women filed complaints and called with issues that they wanted to bring forward and that was in July of two thousand Eighteen or so I can imagine I mean it's close to doubled by the end of this calendar year and what's happened is they get assigned and attorney\nEvent at three attorneys have to get your interview they choose one\nAny attorney can file for the fees\nIs the uh uh California Women's Law center and involved at all and helping those women to protect them\nYeah we are actually and it's the time's up movement right and then the that that um effort we yes we are involved um the national news Law Center although we sort of share name we are not directly related to them but we are related in\nIn God and purpose most definitely so yeah we're we're again that women's community in in the United states and in California is very strong and we've had to get much stronger over the last two years I'll tell you that\nSo much talk about what the Women's Law center dies can a low income wage earner who has an assault issue come forward she folks get representation\nYes we support center which means we don't do direct services but we can help people in litigation and we do do legislation\nComing out of any particular situation so I'm for example like two years ago we were the co sponsor a and took the elimination of the national and patients on rape and California\nTo Cannae Leyva she did get that bill passed um and so we will like it is it it's a low wage earner comes to it yes we will absolutely help them some of our ah attorneys on our board will do pro bono cases and or there are other organizations that will help them so anyone can come to us and whether we can take the case or not\nWe will let you know that we will certainly help you find 'em and interested party who can help\nPeople get in touch with a Women's Law center and we can give us a phone number in a Web site\nSure sure um our phone number is three two three nine five one one zero for one and our website is the W. L. C. dot org and the cat when it was last on our website you can you can go on online we don't we don't do like um\n[noise] you know some organizations have fill out a form of we don't do that just ... or email me I'm happy to help\nOh that's great a bad seed tell me again your email address just that people have at home and they can hear it on the air\nYes mine is Betsy dot butler so it's the ATF why stop butler beauty Eli are at C. W. O. C. dot org\nGreat that's really a terrific that say thank you for all the work that you do how do you like this versus being in the assembly tell us a tell me about the differences and what you prefer [laughter]\nWhere do you know it's very different um when you come up with your own bills as opposed to stopping certain ideas that you have so\nUm fortunately I have gone to senator labor for a lot of the work that we've done 'em and we were a co sponsor on um\nThe standard act we were working with her over the last two years to get that bill I'm into law so so it's really nice that we have a number of people to work with but\nYou know it would be fun if I was still up there doing my own bills but I Know I Know you're pushing\nThe hopefully hopefully we'll see you back there again we'll see what happens you know the other the other center than I Am a very fond of and appreciate all the hard work is Holly Mitchell I got a chance to see her a couple of weeks ago on a friday at her office and she was telling me\nMen's caucuses chess match and of course all these women that you're mentioning ... part of that had a best Jackson any and all our free minutes cetera\nAnd I think they are galvanized hate for a strong activity or next year when the new governor in place and also looking for a key issue so they probably will pick up the issue that you just mentioned about the extension of the statute of limitations or any are you in need to move forward as well [noise]\nOh yes most definitely and in fact there were two other bills that the governor vetoed that were very frustrating that I Know I'm the office will bring back again and actually one of the center live is billed as the three twenty which was asking for abortion medication use either the at you and then also the governor vetoed\nI'm as be fourteen forty nine which was mandating rape kit processing so within a hundred and twenty days so right now we have over Thirteen thousand almost fourteen thousand\nKids in the state of California that have not been process so I'm not really sure why the governor vetoed either the cells of well he he did it for you to let her but um I Know that they'll both come back ah with with our new administration in our new governor\nAnd we'll just say you know we need to be constantly vigilant and it's good to have organizations as well as I Am individuals like yourself\nBut I Know the California Women's Law center is really a strong advocate for women\nAnd I think also the people should consider if there's something you feel it needs to be ... built into legislation or something you have is a concern and there's an opportunity to bring it forward to the Law Center I knew in the case of SP twenty six he was really a conversation with ...\nAnd I and I know the highly Mitchell Center and there was also interested show those of us who have concerns I have to say frankly at ... and I were not confident that SP twenty six would make it through and sailed through but\nIt was worth a try and it is historic and I think people have to understand women in particular that if we don't use our voices for these issues will never get those things even in the dialogue or conversation and I he's just pointed out sometimes it takes more than ... try to get legislation through\nHis take on that on how long it typically takes a bill to make it through and to get accepted\nYou know it's it's hard to say because take\nThe ... limitations on rape that bill was done in part or an old nine times oh they were it actually went through sometimes things have to be done incrementally over a couple of years which is exactly what's going to happen here I mean you know we could talk about equal pay to for a long time yet needs\nTo happen right with that is also an incremental is also\nAn incremental I'm a process because we're nowhere near you know getting people paid 'em what they desert women getting paid what they deserve men are still you know has such a higher percentage of a\nPay than women and and you know equal pay act went into effect in in Nineteen sixty three two and then women really get a bite women only getting paid fifty nine cents it out well we've got up to eighty cents white women ... that's right um women ...\nYear and the sixty eight to Seventy percent so it's a serious damage to write a play what\nTina's Latinas have to work till November second this year to make what a white man a did last\nYear right clearly chop liquids on the job right\nLess yes yes and Latinas you know with the ... in California the poorest people in this country so anyway we have a lot of work to do on a lot of these issues and um but I guess the capping them about center is is happy to talk about a possibility to help make\nLives for women and girls in California even better than than than they are now and how we can do that we're happy to to help\nThank you said this has been a great conversation with Betsy Butler the checking of director of the California Women's Law center\nTelling us about the new laws that have just been passed in California that will help women with discrimination and sexual harassment claims thank you for spending time with us on that just siders you could hear our podcast anytime on our website\nOn that the designers dot com and we'll be back next week here on the designers with Renee Frasier [noise]\nThis show furnish by raise your communication\nCountry's gotta get out and vote on election day to day November\nShapiro encouraging you even right here in California\nVotes [noise] sure is a way to get government right\nBoth [noise] common\nSense you shouldn't have to be seen Los Angeles orange cones cumulus station\n\nA B C\nO just listen to him [laughter]\nI was at a hundred maybe see anything but [noise] I\nHaven't hanging first of two vigils were staged in Pittsburgh tonight to mourn the victims of this morning's deadly attack of the baby naming ceremony\nI'm so unconsciously uncomfortable with how I feel\nThat I have to just spit it out of me and place it into someone else and guess what that other person has what we call a valence for that feeling and and they own all of our stuff and their stuff to they carry it around for us\nWhich is what we see happening in a lot of his finger pointing going back and forth society whether we're talking about\nPeople who exhibit criminal behavior or addictive behavior\nThere are a lot of people who get very self righteous and say well you know that person's bad or that person is a piece of you know what but the reality is we all have the ability to go dark right and to feel negative things and to act out in a way that is not in accordance with how we might like to envision ourselves\nOne of the things I like to do personally when someone has really bothering me are triggering some really strong negative feelings\nYou know you we've all heard kind of saying you spot it you got it yeah though I always think it's really worth going deep and exploring\nWhat is it that is making me feel so passionate about this and what is it in me that maybe I'm not conscious up or I'm trying to adamantly deny\nAnd again like you said people like answers I think people are afraid of their own like subconscious drives and so when they see it and someone else they have to make it bad outside of them ...\nHi it's a safeguard against our own shame right because if we have to acknowledge that we have shadowy parts or dark spots or or green stripes or whatever it is we don't like and then we have to get into reality about what we want to do about\nThat right we can continue to live with our green stripes and just being acceptance of that or we can say you know what I don't want green stripes maybe I Want purple spots instead and work toward making that happen but the reality is\nWe're so subjective as humans that my excellent might be your worst nightmare and vice versa right right and rain we go about the world pointing fingers at people and saying well that's good or that's bad\nAnd what we're really doing I said I spoke about this a few weeks ago on the show is engaging a very primitive part of our development that's trying to assess where do I belong\nRight am I how do I stay safe and when we form allegiances or alliances and cast out things that feel bad or threatening that's a way that we're trying to stay safe and collected and ensure our survival\nRight I was just thinking about that too is the fact that\nA lot of times people don't even have all the information and men are just quick to get on our Hi Morris and judge and I think part of that is just jumping on the bandwagon so that they can feel part of it not as part of our human nature as wanting to belong to the group not a survival mechanism as as well and it's very primitive\nIt is it is and and it's not just shame people for having which is a very natural human reaction we all we all do and we all do it um I think what what we're inviting listeners to consider is\nHow might I be jumping to conclusions and nice black and white areas and not making room for people's gross or redemption race and that's really what I think about when we are going to be talking to our gas coming up in the next segment is\nHow do we navigate as a culture of this idea of redemption and people learning and growing and stepping into the past that for them is most meaningful and is most contributory for society when in fact they have some blemishes in their history\nRight I think that is such an important topic right now with everything that's going on in the media I Know a lot of my male clients it's been a really hard time for them because you know throughout their early you know twenties or their late teens or just earlier in their life they've done things that\nThey're horrified by and they've changed their lives a monthly and\nThey're so afraid of being crucified because of everything that's going on and that's a conversation we've been having as you know how do you make amends right how do you make amends for what you've done so that you can feel like you have a clean slate fear not carrying around that shame anymore\nRight and can we make room for that of society exactly and I think a lot of people feel like if they give breath to their shame then it becomes their current reality and they're going to receive this sort of\nA posthumous stoning right you know that they didn't get when they when they and their minds deserved it but now they're living more can grew in me\nUm but one of the things that we'll talk about when we come back is what happens when our systems to help people in their process of redemption don't work right away that they are intended\nTo and we'll be bringing on a very special guest today Eric Fredrickson and Eric is joining us from\nA law firm in Atlanta and we'll be talking with him about\nA very interesting case that he's working on so

about mental health care in the prison systems with Eric Frederick sent from the harm in law group\nIs a ... group or harm in law firm in Atlanta from law from\nHarvard law firm okay thank you Eric thanks again for being here with us\nAnd just before we took a break we were talking about all the different wrongful death cases that you work on as part of your specialty area and I know you're recently brought to the department of corrections that case about a young man named Jimmy like Sarah how is that something you can talk about with us on air today\nYeah you bet so this is a a a very sad case Jimmy was a Nineteen year old who was sentenced to two years in prison for property theft\nAnd shortly after starting just served his sentence he uh started losing weight rapidly and quickly became a start suffering from depressive Catalonia\nOkay ooh that progress to a point where he was not speaking out moving not eating or drinking\nOr he wouldn't even we sell the shower he wouldn't even get up to to use the bathroom so he's soil and themselves now\nAnd and he was taken to a medical prison here in Georgia a word that in huge and kill he he eventually became unconscious and was taken to a local hospital\nA died from ... it's actually caused by the\nSevere dehydration so basically\nThis Nineteen year old kid was slow to starve to death prisons here in Georgia\nWell that is not a fast process no it's not\nWell no it it took place over about six months yeah that sounds incredibly painful well so what compels you to take this case forward\nI'm as that fact pattern I mean that kind of those kinds of conditions just cannot be tolerated mhm\nThey know modern civilized society I mean if not that it shouldn't be any different but just for an example we know that Guantanamo Bay for example accused mass murders would go on hunger strikes and and the staff there use feeding tubes\nTo make sure they didn't die right oh right my ... year old kid who he just stole\nA car can't get that level of care is it's just not acceptable\nRight exactly that's that's so alarming I mean what from your perspective you know what happened\nThat people were not recognizing the severity of his symptoms\nYou know that's a really good question and I usually have a better answer\nOr is that about most of my cases and in this one I just I don't know what the explanation is and it's early in the litigation process so no one has formally you know made an effort to defend themselves yet which they will\nNot so bad I I honestly I Wish I had a better answer for you but I just don't know it's a well documented especially that last month when he's in the medical prison it's well documented that he's not eating seeking south of phages they\nThey write it down what's going on and then move on I guess to the next ... and nothing was done about it\nWell I'm guessing that you would know better than I because you work with people that have been incarcerated but\nFor her listeners what are some of the things that they could do to help someone that's a point\nWell uh [noise] certainly it there was a point long before it became deadly that he should have just been taken to a hospital\nHospital ...\nUm but before that there are protocols and procedures that correctional systems in criminal correctional departments have for a for actually hunger strikes for example I mean ... on a hunger strike it was a mental illness yeah they have protocols and\nProcedures to deal with in mates who are not eating or drinking so that they don't start to suffer from malnutrition and if you have to you can certainly use a feeding tube uh if if it gets to that point but there's political ... certainly they can use to prevent it from getting even that far\nYet when I worked in the prison systems we often had inmates who would attempt to get certain needs matter or get certain wants match and use a hunger strike manipulate his knee\nAnd oftentimes you know that the system was very quick and nipping not in the butt to keep me safe and make sure that their house did not deteriorate to the point of danger because when someone's\nNot eating it very quickly impacts their brain functioning company limited more impulsive less clear in their thought process and that can present a large danger to themselves or to people around them\nAnd I'm also thinking about human just the sanitary conditions you know if he wasn't able to even come out of the cause of Tony how to use the bathroom and I mean typically people have a soul mate as well\nI Wonder did did this individual how to sell me\nNo I don't believe so ... in the medical prison um but but you're absolutely right I mean it's an sanitary conditions a day that we used to use in if ... meals in the facility so\nDo you know are they treating him with at least with medication or anything prior to this now wow\nNow they were not to Jimmy have a history of mental illness or depression or what do you think prompted such a rapid escalation and his symptoms\nNo it's in hindsight it may have been related to schizophrenia\n... about that age where it may manifest\nIf if it's ever going to ... um but it was it was something that came on you know for the first time an expected Lee\nYeah cut a tone is definitely a psychotic symptom of schizophrenia and also schizophrenia\nCoupled with not age or a predisposition coupled with that edge coupled with a severe trauma and I can imagine you know being in prison with experience does extremely traumatic and probably more than his psyche could handle mhm\nThat's often when we see psychotic breaks happened when there was a really big stressor and right around that window of Jimmy Page he was Nineteen you said when he was brought into the department of corrections right yeah so what are your thoughts on you know how the how a jury will perceive this case\nIf you're listening or anybody knows him tell him I says you\nKnow welcome to a retirement I don't know that he'll like that but he's a real smart guy and a very young guy being Leland lying going into retirement after working so hard with the California however troll for many many years okay one uh maybe\nLet me go back to the phones and speak to Bob real quick I got one thing I wanted to ask him hey Bob joined if I run a joke by you I've been sort of slack up on the jokes\nAbsolutely okay what do you get if you cross an apple with a shellfish\nNot a clue a crab apple love it a couple of jokes\nAbout all that that's pretty fast anyway I can I help you\nLay on I got I got to talk about if you have time\nFor was the most important to me it's fifty six Chevy I had built in the ground up I put an Ellis one in it and of course I drove it every day so it's it's fine dependable runs great go

I got an external view pop or an internal you'd probably get an external\nIts internal in that field tanks into fuel tank then you may have that is a problem and then also a fuel filter comes into my mind as well and then I'm sure you've probably got maybe one or two fuel filters and that vehicle\nYeah OK okay\nJak those sent to run it while because about prominent do you have a separate switch for the fuel pump\nNo no I just turn the key to the is it OK started yeah five four or five times were great I like to buy that car from me I Can't sell it I Love it too much\nFive hundred I got a

up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track ... consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the markets are going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how about\nFirst of vacation as far as different directional vehicles go well you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets\nThe Martin he's going somewhere either going to gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here is it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond chart gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shorting the market now imagine that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy for you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you can wait till a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ally ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the market to go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we\nThere's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know this the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out for it I just dated myself victory over there but\nIt is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals truly guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and they say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's\nWhat they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to is up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nAnd it it just puts us behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a

[noise]\nWe'll come back and if you're just using the humans Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development and topics structure it on line three and a heavy really shuts of life on can just turn to the market is one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come I learned a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income that's a great\nRight you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy\nThinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you\nThat he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work and he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that\nTo be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nFor Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different I needed my time in my life\nAnother student says ...\nAl ... and trying to get something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for that particular call or start that changed my

structured online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of income we talked a little bit about passive income\nWe talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spent a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can regenerate and I love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill it just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now and unfortunately it ends up being that same ... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nReally when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's payday and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside ran that's really that point you were getting at a before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in Iraq lately and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is what I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call 'em crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at them how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that yet about fifty percent dropped Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh\nYeah we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight or you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was if somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and\nThey lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through it'd be a catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to another half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed\nWith lessons from some of our top instructors\nTo professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to stayed on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars that the classes were you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there\nThen my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets that might dust off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination
