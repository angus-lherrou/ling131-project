{"content": "Mhm so what should we be doing to Memphis in the bud before this becomes a major problem\nWell you know I I think credibly frustrated so what we're doing right now is the first part is we're calling for a countywide type is prevention and response plan and you mentioned Pasadena and it's also in Long Beach as you said um they have their own public health departments out in the county of LA runs the public health for the rest of the county\nSo we want to get together and come up with an overall plan that's that's number one\nBut number two we've got to look at the root cause of what's going on and you're absolutely right I talked to drew six months ago and he said I'm telling you that this was in response to ... a crisis he said type fish and then the plague and when I talked to a public health about the play they said there's no way well guess what\nHe's put it to the typist and it's telling me that something's gotta give here as it relates to what's going on with the homeless population\nUm and uh you know so I'm looking at what options we have to address is needed on Skid Row third world country\nAnd I'm Glad the guy you gave the pumpkin or a mountain today was nice I talked to one today who told me to get out of his face which I'm when we did because I realized she meant it\nBut um you know we've got a population downtown um that is far different than what I Believe I'm Twenty years ago which it relates to the homeless population and a lot of it comes back to a mental health a mental health and something has got to give\nYeah you're a hundred percent right and I'll tell you there's another part of the story that needs to be addressed you know one in Sacramento wants to hear it because it goes politically against what they're trying to do right now\nI spoke to Lucile ... who's a city councilwoman in Anaheim who was dealing with skid river down there when that was a big problem before they claim that out\nAnd she said that when she would go down there and talk to these guys\nThey were very frequently a prop forty seven or ... fifty seven or eight one oh nine early release prisoner these are people that belong in prison they were sentenced by a judge in a jury\nTo a particular sentence and we let them out early and people aren't hiring them in some cases they're not even looking for work and so they end up on the streets and if you're letting people out of prison early at a at a very fast rate than you're homeless population is just going to explode along with it\nSo you know I I look at it for a look at it from the standpoint of 'em are the people that say you know they they did their time we should get never pretend to be I completely agree with that but I Believe we had set them all up for failure\nBecause when you look at each one individually ab one oh nine ... forty seven ... fifty seven which by the way I don't think the legislature had the stomach to do an A. B. fifty seven because they got slammed on eighty one oh nine\nBut it's a perfect storm it is a perfect storm you have actually set up failure\nMany of those that were transferred down to LA county I'm from the state prisons um had serious mental health addiction problems and they they were they were not\nFlagged as as meeting this and the money was not provided to us to eat and provide them with the services that they needed so we set them up for failure\nYou look at any big disease in the United states that killed a bunch of people\nAnd you go back and you look at when you when when the disease first started and the epidemic first began and governments or health departments whatever failed to take the proper acts and that could have prevented lots of pain lots of suffering lots of adapt in some cases\nAnd they say we should learn from is we should never allow this to happen again yet people continue to make the same mistakes over and over and over again and from your perspective it's just got to be frustrating to look good but it seems to be screaming about it you know in the newspaper and on the radio and I'm sure your colleagues and to the bureaucrats that work\nFor the county and and to to not have the the action that you're looking for it would it's got to be frustrating\nWell you know it's frustrating and and I and not to not get graphic but last week I start on Monday I was coming down a Los Angeles and turning right on temple or a woman who is clearly mentally ill walked up to the curb pulled out are passing proceeded to death okay right\nThere at home I ... what does the ...\nSame fight friday same same street a guy just doing his business right there on the sidewalk and people walk by drive by don't even think twice about it are you kidding me I mean ... what kind of country\nLive and where we allow this to happen what about the dignity I mean I was not angry when I saw that I was I was actually very\nUnhappy and very sad but now I'm angry because we are enabling the homeless population to create a public health epidemic that is impacting not only the homeless population but but people throughout I mean Pasadena roost son got it uh hiking in the royal\nUm you know something has got to give here\nAnd so I Am angry and frustrated but I'm not going to give up because I Do believe that we have to address mental health law's up in Sacramento we were close we didn't get over the finish line but I can guarantee you I'm not going the way on that issue I think it's a measure H A are homeless a calculated that if we don't address\nThe mentally ill on the streets people would have to like they got ripped off by this tax in eight years\nAlright supervisor Catherine ...

beforehand which is a smart idea but it the air force base itself is completely destroyed they're gonna have to redo the whole thing\nIncredible will thanks again David thanks for your report yesterday um and thanks for following up\nToday I'm Glad that you're safe not not\nLots of all there's not as I was lucky as you and we were given I'm sure there'll be disaster relief of as lines and you know is that we'll be able to send out him since sources that we can raise some money and help the folks that on there is going to be a while a while like you said first they got to do the cleanup send in the first responders and then through the process of rebuilding\nYeah I'll get in touch with you because we're starting to in fact we are studying the goal right now locally here does need to raise a million dollars you got it on both with it but that was so I'll I'll be in touch\nFear keep in touch absolutely David thanks like you're\nTo take it easy she heard the devastation down there it's amazing you're up here where\nThousands of miles away you see it and forget about it that these people are going to be digging out for years trying to get their businesses in their lives back together um while I just saw an image of Kanye West and the White House sitting in the oval office joking around with the president [laughter] as far as taking that I'm\nInto a press conference in the event against Steve would have to he's sitting with his finger on the dump button because who knows Kanye every year every once in a mall let's fly something that you shouldn't we also there was news that can rocking chair and Jim Brown is there\nSo that's that's a Hollywood Squares that I haven't seen before jump around the block with tiny it was a kid rock who\nSo has them I Know kid rock also a tendency to want to go go off script quite a bit so they're they're discussing I don't know what I don't ... it might not know what he's discussing but I Can't wait to see a transcript from that thing or get some tape from that meanwhile the big ag that\nThe president is dealing with now and I'd love to get your take on this eight hundred to two to five to two\nIs a new crown prince Mohammed bin Salman came to power and twenty seven twenty Seventeen and he was supposed to be the liberal reformer 'em by stomping on clerics and he helps them concerts and he did this big lobbying blitz for the United states it it's a form of friendlier sweeter\nA Saudi a meanwhile the deal over there is he's just seems to be as ruthless dictator as as he needed to be he's arrested he had folks killed um Iraq he rounded up as as being the successor as being the next king he was consolidating his power\nErupted eleven princes in a foreign ministers and dozens of businessmen and billionaires\nAnd the problem is that the president has been banking on the relationship with the Saudis to help\nA squelch a Iran's um growth any growth from Iran and to help us with Israeli peace et cetera plus they buy arms from us the problem is now a he may have ordered the butchering of a high profile us resident and journalist\nSo Congress I mean Lindsey Graham went crazy he went back blank are saying if this is the case we're just going to be hell to pay and they're looking at sanctions is after the president has been much more tentative again he knows the guy supposedly Jared Kushner's very friendly with him and he had been talking to him about\nMiddle East peace and its alleged that even had some\nPhone conversation that didn't go through the normal channels so there's not a real record of that of of what they talked about and um that again it's a really close tight relationship plus you add to that\nThat the president has business interests over there and um you know people in singles is protecting his business interests as a conflict of interest that uh he sided with Saudi Arabia when they went after cut her instantly because cutter did not\nBuild a Trump Hotels et cetera and the but the the European the uh the the the ... the Saudis did and I'm trying to remember which rather I said oh the image that too so he's got the Emirates and he's got the Saudis where he's got real estate actually\nCut her he didn't and people saying well wait a minute does that have to do with any kind of business interests so there's a lot of layers to this and the president's been more tentative than Congress now he gave a forty six minute an interview to Fox and here are some of the things he said\nIt would be a very sad thing and we will probably know a very short future we have certainly incredible people and incredible talent working on it we don't like it I don't like it you know good\nEnded they said ... again they don't know where he is it's not a hundred percent that he's dead but supposedly what happened the Saudis it's been reported sending to just loads\nOf Saudis Fifteen in each jets and they were seen as one report has ever seen taking pieces ... pieces in boxers out or in other words that they had basically\nSnuck 'em out of this symbol and gotten back into Saudi so I'm Saudi Arabia and again\nThe what what he did wrong he wrote about the regime over there\nAnd it wasn't flattering that's it uh when asked about on Fox he said this\nIs very very seriously I don't like it at all now you know you don't have American citizens but\nThat in this case doesn't matter I don't like it I don't like it with respect to reporters it's a\nTerrible terrible precedent we can't let it happen and being very tough and we have investigators over there and working\nWith turkey and frankly we're working with Saudi Arabia we want to find out what happened and it doesn't look like it came out it certainly doesn't look like it around\nAnd again the Saudis give us a lot of business we saw a lot of arms to the Saudis but he needs a you know he needs the Saudis to help us like I said with Iran a but it's no secret that the Iranian backed militias on the ground fighting ISIS with Iran has a great influence in Baghdad so um he's\nJust going to play out this could be very very ugly I'm sure the administration would just like to go away to just like a lump off into the sunset but it's not going to because like I said a bipartisan Congress is of really upset about this and here's how he talked about the Saudis in our relationship\nI wouldn't say they're excellent I've told they've got to pay for that military Saudi Arabia has a\nIt's a very rich country and for years and years it would be no Saudi Arabia if it wasn't the United states because we protected them and we don't get paid for this\nProtection we should we pay we spend billions and billions of dollars here protecting Saudi Arabia and king king Solomon ...\nSorry you got to pay and I've said that\nThe ... are they going to kill that you can't you can't be killing everything is yet right now ...\nWhat happened when I Do and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out what happened\nSo that was Fox News pressing him saying you just can't come on American journalists the Washington Post journalist and get away with it there have to be repercussions so\nFox is pushing back a Turkish officials are publicly accusing the Saudis are not cooperating with the investigation and again the wall Street Journal poured into two gulfstream jets\nFerried Fifteen men in and out of this stumble to belong to a company controlled by Saudi crown prince a not a good thing\nI'm political reports that it was actually the crown prince\nWho asked the caller questioner and Michael Bolton after a top us official the embassy asked him directly about the case early in the week in a apparently he did have a phone call with ... and bolt and\nAh and then Tuesday evening a group of foreign policy figures attended a dinner with some senior White house officials with responsibility for the middle east because this could heat up\nInto a much much bigger problem\nUm and also the public and chairman and democratic ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee moved to force the president on sanctions they sent a letter to the president\nUm triggering the global Magnitsky Act which gives the president a hundred and twenty eight hundred twenty days decide whether to impose sanctions on any foreign person he determines sponsored was involved in the disappearance of ... so they're doing that and like I said Lindsey Graham went crazy he said there'll be hell to pay\nIf the Saudis killed his show ... Rand Paul called for cutting off slowly military and sugars return and as I said now you have the president's sitting there with a relationship with the prince his son and daughter have a relationship with the\nFriends their business interests in Saudi Arabia um and\nAnd they're our ally in helping us while Iran and help with the middle east\nSo it's developing into a diplomatic big time mess if you'd like to talk about that eight hundred to two to five to two two there are a lot of moving parts to that but uh uh in the sun feel that the they're kind of taunting Trump because they know that his hands are tied and he may not\nHe may not to fire back quite the way a Congress wants him to which is why Congress\nIs getting very vocal about this so right before the midterms we have this situation with the Washington Post journalist who was killed them by the way on his eve you're supposed to getting married\nSo bad bad bad timing bad situation um and again we've we use these countries as gas stations for a long time a ... he was an enemy than he was our gas station and her friend and then he was no longer or friend or Saudi the number one\nAh oil exporter in the world less relevant for world today than they were years ago because we're less beholden but it's still an important ally and like I said Trump as a personal relationship so we'll see how he handles the situation\nBut it's going to be daunting for him\nSo if you'd like to participate eight hundred to two to\nFive to two two he was also a ... he's gets pushback to for being at a rally um and he addressed that if you while the hurricane was going on in Florida and he said that he went because there are thousands of people who expected them to come and he didn't want to disappoint them also he

Weinstein but what we're hearing now is there may be an issue with the case and there could be a discovery of exculpatory evidence and what happened here is now the\nThe case is based on allegations from three different women but they're saying now a written account from one of the women\nAre gives the impression that her experience may have been consensual um according to the New York post one of Lucia Evans former employers\nHanded over a written account from an office computer\nThat could tell a different story from what she told the grand jury or she accused Weinstein of forcing you to perform oral sex on him in two thousand and four and what this source has told the post is that the writings indicate that it was consensual and friendly\nUh which has caused basically\nAn upheaval in the da's office because they believe some in India's office believe the charges should be drop 'em and that there's a problem with the complaint but they decided to move forward\nOr the judge will announce expected announce whether it's going to dismiss the count related to the ovens allegations and this comes after apparently another step back in the form of allegations that lead\nOn the case may have coached a witness before she appeared before the grand jury so um and they're more allegations obviously in addition to the street or he has a sexual harassment assault from dozens and dozens

accused her of sexually assaulting him\nWhen he was a minor um she was giving her speech at times denouncing the festival calling at Harvey Weinstein's hunting ground\nOr after she was alleged to have been paid paid Bennett three hundred eighty thousand dollars for assignments\nSo last week she goes on and try and talk show to ask in public for her job back she said Italy wants to me and I've done nothing that I've been accused of a which is kind of fascinating and the host actually got the audience to applaud um the interviewer remarked that Bennett didn't look traumatized\nDrug set in photos that he saw can you imagine seeing photos of a female who looks happy after day after watching going well apparently he's your choppy so I guess that didn't happen\nSo again she initially denied that you have a sexual relationship with Bennett and then she now claims she was raped by him so during this interview on this on the show\nShe compared the teenager timeline steam and asked how can you sexually assaulted actors that how can you sexually assault a man\nSo we went to a new chapter for this um and she had to fight with rose McGowan so this is pretty interesting um where the ... me too

um\nGeniuses made a ton of money running production studio some ended up running studios and I heard all the stories I Can't be sure but the behavior was different when I got to hear an eighty something\nPeople were doing more drugs at businesses the ... it's it's like the friends lawsuit when the intern said that she was offended by what was going on in the friends writer's room and they said the environment and the writers' room\nYou're allowed to go we need to go to find comedy well in Hollywood at that time\nYou know in our movie sets and stuff I saw then would not happen now nearly nearly to the extent of the den and Harvey was a powerful gone\nSo people hey look the other way be I don't think they knew the extent of what he did because others weren't in the room when it happened but when you're a powerful guy and you're the guy is getting people movies and winning Oscars for them and writers people are willing to go oh well I what\nHe's doing can't be so bad so that was the whole point of the me too movement as a matter of fact that the the challenges that the male driven system that protected you know men at the expense of vulnerable women or however and now

Reagan the books bigger than your head\nAnd he spent five years and he had access to a previously unavailable documents interviews\nComing up stuff you didn't know about Reagan on the day that they're doing his uh his three D. hologram at the Reagan Library so we'll talk about that next with him and then we'll take your calls eight hundred to two to five to two when Peter ... continues right after

Jillian and John\nLos Angeles Orange County cumulus station [noise]\nThe mob or almost like fifty years of readers digest articles um he loved folksy stories and and a lot of these stories were apocryphal you know they they they were that true but he took them to heart and he turned them into policy in some cases\nAnd that reached middle America it resonated\nIt really did yes I mean it was the middle American voice and of course that's where he came from so it was no great surprise that uh that Reagan wound up doing what he did I mean this he was a he came from the our lab\nAnd by the way sports broadcaster did he get his negotiating did you learn much negotiating from the sag presidency I mean there have been tough\nNo no it wasn't tough actually I was lucky enough to get to uh get into their files and the archivist it at the Screen Actors guild said oh you know you might see this or this file it has all of Reagan's a handwritten speeches there wow wow what an eye opener\nThey were on yellow paper written now on cat I'm ... and you can really see see his political beginnings right they're very thoughtful and and actually surprising to me because I had just been to his college beforehand eureka college\nIn eureka Illinois and you know Reagan got\nMostly season ... on his report card so by the time he gets to Hollywood he's grown up a little\nAnd he really becomes quite thoughtful and and has a poll or a real political under parties that I'm allowed him to be the president of the Screen Actors guild at one of the the darkest moments in Hollywood history\nI write talking about spits author of of Reagan which is amazing to see this book an American journey how detailed it is Nancy I hit a lot of people who advised him and some that you listen to something you didn't listen to Nancy was such a big part\nOf his life and I got an insight into Nancy that I didn't have before because I always looked at her kind of an ice queen just protected him\nOr not that big a sense of humor except that I was finally really finding costs with Joan Rivers and John used to tell me that she Nancy and I think is best he Bloomingdale used to have a standing lunch every couple of months and Nancy love more than the gossip and talk dirt about behind the scenes and people and had a great sense of humor\nThat's true you know it's funny bitter but when I when I began to park I thought well I I I Know who Nancy is because I had I had a great experience with the Beatles\nNancy was the yoke Ohio\nCharacter in the Reagan story about\nBoy was I wrong I was completely wrong because we had an image of as you said ... square right and and she was not accessible to the press she didn't deal with them she had a tough time dealing with some people are thinking that they were perhaps beneath or\nBought on the other hand she was the ... she was the power behind the throne with Reagan and she did something really extraordinary\nHer one goal was that Ronald Reagan would have a great legacy she wanted to preserve that like I say and she wanted it to be of a man of peace and so it was Nancy who really from the beginning urged him\nTo make peace with the Soviet Union she pushed him to have the Geneva summit with Gorbachev and meet Gorbachev and I think without Nancy Reagan we would not have had that remarkable and ah of the Cold War that Reagan help bring about\nAnd it's great that you got to see that insight to 'cause it blew me away too after seeing her image and hearing your talk and seeing it for years and years to misunderstand who she was kind of stunning\nShe also kept him out of the abortion debate even though he was completely against abortion\nOr Nancy realized that women have a strong voice she was in favor of it and so he could be against it you could tell a the the pro life um people that he was with them but he never appeared with them in public any of their offense because Nancy really directed\nHim well and also Hollywood folks understand optics just like Trump understands aka these as these guys get what to do and how to appear although much like this White House there was jealousy and infighting in administration to Nancy um was it was in control of some of that also correct\nOr she was absolutely the control or you didn't really operate in the White House without the uh the improvement or they have to read um his chief of staff was connected to our certainly might\nDeaver who was a one of the ah they're important people were raised in a spoke to her four or five times a day and she had a hotline to ah the chief of staff when Don Regan which which is such that she would watch CNN all day long up in the residence\nAnd she would call Don Regan I Would say why as Romney saying this why are they saying honey how to change it by the way it is funny\nIt comes full circle watching TV saying the the the result of what something we've just said and doing instantaneous self polling to decide which way to go next\nAbsolutely it was it was almost like you know instant messaging America that is\nPretty amazing and enemies almost got ... pedaling you point out that they were coming it was ready to go to hammer was ready to come down on him\nOr it it really was they found out that ah he had given a some sweetheart deals to ah to import business man and the evidence was\nPretty strong but they could never really uh bring a case against him and at least was the one guy who hung around a it Reagan circle and his aura from the time Reagan was governor all the way through we his presidency\nAnd unfortunately\nWe spent about a hundred hours what may detailing almost every aspect of Reagan's ... a political career\nWhich is studying the access you got you know in this me too movement or they started pointing out a couple of months ago there was a well hey Reagan was a womanizer too and maybe even dress that issue because you do talk about a love before Nancy and that he did he did date a lot of when he was out here and he's an actor all the way up to when he got married\nHe he didn't date a lot of people like to to say it was a womanizer\nBut you know in between
