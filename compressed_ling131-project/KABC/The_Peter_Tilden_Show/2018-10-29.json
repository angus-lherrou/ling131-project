{"content": "And number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they've blown up the money that they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey've realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is being done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that desire\nAbsolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the stuff that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these the season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake I use these bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal that we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do there is to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life that you're after and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the shows doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of view of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're going to start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you think we do know that give away yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here All right right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big enough you will find a how and how is out at the half day class now just to say you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you're driving now is

retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there Larry thanks for joining me always great to hear Ryan

Los Angeles Orange County\n\n[noise]\nThis you know and I mean let me let me stop you for a second 'cause I Want to run a point an arrow to that so people understand that\nThere is a portion of the Republican Party conservatives who felt for years and so for years that they've been besieged by the media because if you spoke out about ... immigration will ... oh my gosh you are you are definitely um you know phobic and\nYou're you're the person that I teach thirty would've kept juice all coming in from the Holocaust\nAnd if you speak out about said anything about the president they felt like well you're a racist in his ... if you if if you spoke on certain issues you demonize anyway\nAnd when I talked to folks that's what people on the left don't understand that those folks focus east for so long by the media and you feel that he has even if Trump wasn't there whoever's there\nWho's going to take it into shorts no matter what and be demonized on those issues as your bad people so and it's hard to look at it from the perspective but I think it's an important conversation to have\n... until you feel and understand why the anger is there you don't understand it and if you have to deal with\nIt but I I watch CNN and Fox and it was to go back and forth because if I back on the journalism\nAnd I'm starting to see different America as honest I'm stationed at the same job for example you'll see treasure Trump talking somewhere she turned Fox News and they carry it live she ended up now in in my day you'll always carry depressing it live on CNN no matter what\nBut again in the new normal the presence on continuously and would eat up the entire news cycle\nBut this'll be it a thing where were you know he's giving a speech stuff or giving it a public reaction to something that they will always breakaway where she always break break away and Fox they will so I'm just think it's different realities of of of of America or you know Fox has to tilt toward Trump's but CNN is all day long for antitrust angle no matter what the news\nAs well and it's money but his money and it's you know at this point nobody just reporting stories anymore hardly anybody just reporting stories anymore the money you make is by having a controversy and again\nSo you come out and you see parts of Lou Dobbs jobs the bombs are fake like Munoz 'cause he's done an investigation and sing and does he come back and say I apologize when I put it out there was wrong they got the guy and his wrong\nToday I read report that said all of those uh stickers on the guys when they're not faded so it's also forced because they must have been put on newly and sending this guy out so that story now that this guy really didn't produce pickers up and wasn't pro Trump and this is the Democratic plot so people put that stuff out\nBut you see the same thing like you see many conservatives I think rightly so worrying\nThat the people who run Facebook to run for all these things are going to start censoring things and and when they censor do censor rules are criteria parameters are going to reflect political bias and so for example just because somebody\nLet's say it ah is is a devout Christian and questions the idea of same sex marriage\nDoes me there could have had committed violence against gays just because somebody is strongly against abortion doesn't mean they're going to\nKnow how they got a guy\nThat just because somebody harshly criticized the Trump doesn't mean they're going to try to do some violence against the president\nThey got they got their hands or [laughter] you got your job cut out for them was trying to figure out\nWhat he lets the Holocaust in Ireland and I remember he made a comment about the ... and\n... I I had tremendous numbers of relatives who cares virtually during the Holocaust I Believe everybody has a right to say the whole the cost to denied the Holocaust I think it's reprehensible view it's factually wrong it's awful usually that kind of a person is a bigger delays Jews\nBut in Germany is illegal the United states I think it should be a legal for people to say things that are of a deeply offensive and prejudicial and bigoted all the rest\nBut that's my view this classic standpoint of freaks me now from a practical standpoint I have to tell you for for most of them from the standpoint of trying to prevent tragedies prevent violence is so this idea of of private companies following the lead a political correctness and censoring things mean you're going to drive that nut cases\nThat potential ground underground yeah I think that's bad\nWell I think it's been two months on continuing on his route you also have members of the me too movement who are supporting Louis Farrakhan and if I read your the list and stuff that Louis Farrakhan says you go oh my God it's totally represent forever\nYears we had all these prominent a liberal say that it's very to associate him with Clinton or associate him with with Obama you'd have the wonderful a futile already to greater wreath at Franklin and then not and it is an\nInvited to the audience or someone who just showed up at on the stage a few feet away they'll put it's fair to end the everybody acknowledges a is a big it\nWoman I'm no I'm kidding yet yet different rules they're right which which are reprehensible so\nWhen I look at the hatred and we have this conversation about hatred is very very complicated about how people are processing um ... what\nWhat the rhetoric means when the other side says it why they process of the way they do so it it's fascinating to see I Hope we can move the ball a little bit more using social media\nThey're just trying to figure out now that's in the wild west what to do with hate speech on social media now we've come to a place where you're looking at Brazil\nWhere do you think about the new president and he was ... if if people weren't familiar with him and he's having a female child is a weakness\nYou said I Would not review because you're not worthy of it too to a former lawmaker he said I'd rather have a son dying to ... them be gay um torture you advocate advocates and he said I'm a former who on the same day or if he would shut down Congress if he were president zero\nBut some of the editors at the house it how you described him which are stored nearly deplorable as things change society these things change and they will change there now and you get into other things that are specific public policy\nIt's it's it's it's different but you know this whole idea of hate speech I find very Orwellian where someone decides what hate speech is because there's a thin line between\nWhat some people regard as is bitterly awful hatred and just a difference of opinion remind you that very thing was twilight zone episode of duties knives hold there were all these people this woman is undergoing surgery and she comes out beautiful they're all saying God look at how ugly she is and you look at them and they're ugly by our standards\nAnd so I'm not justifying the speech I'm simply saying we treading on dangerous ground\nI understand or know what I think everybody got what you're saying there but now you're going to Brazil those are pretty amazing comments now they have insane violence ... violence in Brazil they got their economy is in crisis they got corruption scandals so this guy looks to be their senior\nWhat right and and and they've been frustrated for years I was in Brazil when suddenly\nAmazon the amount of drugs coming in to the Amazon was unbelievable\nAnd Brazil is the number one source out of the ... okay it's going downhill\nI ... was with a fellow from our embassy there he said he was from San Diego moving back his wife's case that's what gets you stand there you have a nice place and say oh yeah the guy ... nice place like she walks a dog and a two different occasions there have been dead people on the street there and they just stood there for days to govern picked him up\nThere and point now where they're willing to embrace this guy he's rhetoric because they feel he's there he's he's playing talking and he's going to save the country\nRight and and uh we've had this before but we have to hold if it's not some sort of you know third right side of the guys that go on but just to sort of temporary a reaction against an essential failure government to provide the basic functions of civil protection\nSo that Brazil shifting to that direction an angle and Merkel big announcement that she's not going to seek reelection again she's she's saying she's in the German version of I Want to spend more time with my family\nYeah look Angela Merkel started out of East German origin\nReaction against communism she was in many ways the perfect leader for you to find like east and West Germany and all the rest there but she is so over compensated\nFor a ... Germany the Nazi regime going back to another ... era there that there was a feeling of of having some sort of restraints on immigration was somehow an expression of an age old bigotry of ... and the guilt thing there\nAnd I think as a public policy it has failed Germany has failed to to assimilate this vast number of new immigrants into their society\nAnd before we go we only got ... weapons when you're talking about these joint in your shoes on and kind of moving quickly through them but a story that kind of limped off for now for the second is democracy what's what's going to happen was that standoff with the rest of the world of ... the Saudis turkey I mean I\nI think the president has made it a great mistake by keep talking about a hundred and ten million dollars and make it sound like it's a money issue even though frankly you can't ignore the ... the reality is ...\nIs an ally their strategic ally they're doing all sorts of things\nAre known or are there to help in the in the in the Mid East and we have to find a way to make clear that what was done was unacceptable and if this is the triple crown prince I I think he said I don't think he can continue on their even know\nOddly this is a man who was working for the same kinds of reforms that many liberals do this is the kind of a guy who said women can drive it sounds so preposterous to be listening to your show that that it is something that you know dynamic\nAnd again having been to Saudi Arabia I Would never expected women to drive in my lifetime\nBut but again he's a limited performer and it's still arresting filming it\nJust as he said were former or their style which is just ... oil family still controls everything I remember this is the guy who was the other thing if you go back and and and look he called and a bunch of the rich people for a conference lock them up and the four seasons hotel they didn't do it\nThey couldn't have been more yeah the scandal\nOf dollars to the government because they were like corrupt they really work\n...

theater in Hollywood center AMA dome one person was hit by gunfire but police have not released any details about the person who was shot including their gender age or condition and there's no word on what prompted police to open fire\nThe beginning twenty fourteen I also he's two hundred fifty million dollar contract\nThat has base salary is thirty two million for twenty Nineteen and thirty three million in twenty twenty and according to our website that the monitors professional sports contracts\nSo I don't hear him saying I Love it here I Love the players are we got three days and I hope we can work it out but he is saying things like ah I'm going to look at the ... it's nothing about hey I Love it here like I said I I don't I don't see him going somewhere else\nYou the truth I see him signing a new deal\nUm where the current two years left\nOr somehow restructured and what they do in these big money deals as they usually the first some of the payment and then the guarantee of in later years so he'll get like a long term contracts with a lower\nAnnual salary so then you might get a free agent but then he also doesn't have to go out there he becomes part of the Dodgers and their marketing and their legacy and he's honored here and it becomes a bigger\nThe good thing to these lifetime Dodger so I think that's worthwhile to him although he may just go for the money or he may not like management here I have no idea I haven't talked to the guy ever in my life but it just seems like there's something missing there that spark\nOf a cohesive team that like I said is dying\nDying and do and doing anything for the manager management and it's not something that's necessarily that you can see 'cause I guess they played hard except from outer who doesn't run and doesn't hustle um the other thing is and Doug you said this in the morning and Doug is more of a [noise] a fan of\nBaseball in the sense defended the history of baseball on strategy or baseball he said the Dodgers seem to be swinging for the teachers I mean every every play their swing for the home run instead of\nPunching the ball in a home and getting ... or ... or single or double or moving movement around looting the bases and nobody's going for the hero play they just want to get get on base and let the wind up through the student's job a dying Mondale mornings any of that makes sense or am I on in my mind\nI think you're so dead on a citizen American tire might have to take a backseat to you\nKnow are dug a historian when it comes to that but I just watch the guy when a manager who's supposed to rally the troops doesn't have the support in higher ups how's the teams to rally\nI completely agree I don't see a lot of what the team and I'm thinking all of this I play it and I watch it I'm a Dodger fan\nYou've got your best player sitting on the bench and if this whole thing is done by saving metrics the rest of the players are going to be happy what do we got a desk guys on the bench that will just the fastest guy to not playing there's Nazi with thirty five years but they're still interested in\nIn stats and this is merely a pop it might have some problems but your analysis any closer to the truth on his first shot\nBefore we're done I like to see him do a lot of fuel for when they got ... always injured and actually you know what I didn't give you what I was supposed to be giving you money for that or whatever you're doing\nThe show has got to be frustrated as the rest of the players on the bench in my opinion\nI Would think and I do see curse and again I may have not seen it I may have missed that D.C crush on saying things like I Would I Hope we work this out because I really love to stay here or LA is my home I Love the dodge organization I Love Roberts I Love the any of that\nIs probably a slow straighter anybody he's a competitor but here again he was one guy but he has faltered in the playoffs after you know no question he's a walk in favor of the play offs but he's got no support it can be frustrating as everybody else\nAlso when players are not happy and they don't feel like the guy who's calling the shots is really calling the shots so I Can't talk to them about anything 'cause he's not really the guy anyway and he doesn't have the authority to do it it's like a virus in the in the in the in the clubhouse there's this that's like the elephant in the room that nobody is talking about or maybe they're all talking about it\nOn on how to navigate this remembered they didn't they do this with Donny with mounting to they didn't sign is contract they didn't extend it and he was playing and he was angry I remember a press conference where he was actually really angry\nOver this straight on it was some other people think that your your analysis is dead on\nWill cause players are complicated folks they don't just train to hit and run and do all of that there that it's a head game too if you sit and look in the dugout the most fascinating thing when you're the cursor coming after pitching\nHe's not even watching what's going on the field because it doesn't matter what's going on in the field he's figuring out in his head what he's got to throw the next inning when he's up who he's throwing against and he's he's got to focus\nSo he's in his had a lot of those players are in their head when you're missing when you're just slightly off or the team is slightly off as far as that rhythm it can affect play in a big way so again I'm not an expert at this point I wanted to wanted to get some folks who kind of connected to watch baseball a lot in the strategy\nTo see what they thought so thank you for your input or a guide like to have somebody who doesn't agree or give me another perspective on this because it's it's kinda sad and I don't know\nIf they're going to do your firearm if you let him go\nBecause they got into the the World Series but they didn't win it two years in a row is that enough of an accomplishment that you give the guy the next contract or or the is he going to be\nOn the way out so encouraged ... kind of you know he's at the age now he's ... he doesn't have to fast but what has happened with the thirty year old guy\nAnd the things ... thirty or thirty one year olds during the off season when you can't throw like you used to do all kinds of workarounds you've got to figure out what to do with my ... what do I do with my slider you gotta you gotta do other stuff\nBecause you're not throw in like that guy of all the or whatever his name was the other thing was throwing a hundred miles an hour ball and placing them like rockets are crucial doesn't have that anymore he's into a Ninety One mile an hour fastball so he's got to do or work around I think they would like to keep them because of who he is and what you can still do and you can still do a lot of damage\nBut it sure doesn't sound like he he's he's going to bat and wants to be here no matter what so if you want to comment on that really would love to hear your take eight hundred to two to five to to to a moving on however until we talk about that or maybe we won't anymore really\nInteresting piece that was in the daily news right Susan Shelley with voting coming up in midterms it it's really interesting she points out\nThe word funding when you see a bill that says funding um what that means is that it is and tax in debt those words when you hear funding\nYou forget about tax and that\nIt's a nice warm word you're funding this you're funding that your funding Girl Scout drips your funding in front of your funding puppies so when funding is on the ballot\nShe points out and she's right it means higher taxes or usually existing tax revenue to pay higher debt that is what funding means either you're gonna it's higher taxes\nOr you're gonna pay and fund higher debt prop one authorizes bonds to fund specified housing assistance programs prop to authorize as pawns to fund existing\nHousing programs prop three authorizes bonds to fund the projects for water supply ... authorizes bonds funding construction as hospitals so\nBonds happened to be deaths\nAnd they don't mention that its debt because it adds to the accumulation of our debt obligations so if they said\nYour funding is really debt obligations and we're now adding to more and more and more debt and you're gonna have to you and your children off at that for the ... the thirty years' fifty years the rest of your life who would vote for that so she also points out if you read her all the way to the end of each of those some reason the four propositions\nMilk costs one of a hundred and Seventy no another hundred and forty million another four hundred and thirty mill another eighty mill\nEvery year for the next thirty five to forty years\nSo that you should know also enters into the fact that we have to pay that debt first debt payments were made first anything left over funds what we needed to find some bonds have the first call on state revenue even of taxes have to be raised to pay for everything else\nThey have the first call on state revenues um props six she does point out that repeals the twenty Seventeen tax increase on gasoline diesel vehicle risks evening you know I feel about that we've talked about that many times\nInstead of saying the prop six is a gas tax repeal what you'll see when you go to vote is eliminate certain road repair and transportation funding that's what you read instead of\nIs the gas tax repeal so remember funding is tax increase so gas tax repeal\nIt is not there and um the balance is your includes funding in a lot and a lot of places I'm like the funding is going to be paid by property owners of the partial tax\nIt's an extra charge and at the property tax okay a school district bond is going to be repaid with attacks of five cents for a hundred dollars of assessed value will increase the property taxes on the six hundred thousand are owned by three hundred dollars per year so\nYou're not seeing tax increases you're not seeing that you're seeing funding and when they say funding they mean\nThe ... general purposes which requires only a simple majority and does not have to go to anything specific so if you've seen sales tax increase to pay for police and fire services ambulances and its general funding as soon as you see in general you know that it doesn't have to go\nSpecifically to what they're asking for sure if you see general funding on the ballot\nIt's not clear what prompted officers to open fire and
