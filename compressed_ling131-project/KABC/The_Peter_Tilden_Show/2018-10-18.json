I'm waiting for my job are you bringing my shot I think Joe producer Joe oh you got it and you got your shot so we'll do that in a minute I'm I'm going to get to some calls to\nAlso you know let's jump into some stuff that the emails that are written that I Want to get an answer to a David I'm Alzheimer's I got a really interesting email\nAbout Alzheimer's and somebody wanted to know if they read an article about psychiatric symptoms may be an early sign sway dug up this this article that just came out of the study the depression and anxiety maybe signs of early stage Alzheimer's how do you know how can you isolate that\nIn the kinds of studies suggest their study of paper which has now featured in the journal of Alzheimer's disease psychiatric symptoms enough to cause more likely early indicators have you heard that that that there are things stand for weight early\nIt's absolutely true and it's not a question of how to you isolated it's it's being aware of the health care provider that people that come in in that age group and that demographic that are now experiencing new onset psychiatric issues you have to consider that and your differential\nAnd you you look at appetite changes sleep disruption depression agitation anxiety does that's stuff that come when someone comes in and says it's been a personality change in my spouse that's when you notice\nIt's all of those things feeder and remember we're dealing with a population an aging population so aging itself creates some anxiety and some depression and some of these symptoms are generic to just getting older so you have to be you you have to be a detention\nSleep with a let's go on to talk to Louis in Sherman Oaks we come back on TALK staying with dementia ... another email was about what are the the best drugs for treatment of agitation in in ... how do you deal with that person a Luis in Sherman Oaks good morning what's your question\nOf of course with a doctor or think of a great show by the way like all of\nYour um my question was that I have a fourteen month old boy have four and a half year old girl or my wife and I and we're considering a flu shot ... forces now going I was actually my wife and I had a couple of weeks so\nThat we're actually somewhat scary because of the things that are being set out there and the effects of a sure what it's all\nSo the question is for ... is it too early or you can sort of the entire family\nMy apologies ... is it squarely\nAt fourteen months I'm and I'm assuming that my ... and I wonder what the doctor thought about\nLouis ... these are these are common and good questions and you're fourteen month old is fine anything after six months is appropriate or I should say anybody not anything but but any any child beyond six months is appropriate for the vaccine and the older the better the more immuno compromised\nOr a a number of different illnesses chronic illnesses that people have they're really good candidates everybody is a good candidate and remember this is a highly contagious\nVirus so that around the end of the year when people are traveling when people are stressed from all the other issues going on around the end of the year it's really important to try to maintain your health and people die from the flu man this is another thing that people overlook\nAnd the risk benefit is a far on the side of the benefit but yes I Would encourage a you your wife your kids to get the shot a there won't be a residual from this they do work and I think you're doing a as a dad I think you're doing the right thing for your family\nI'm curious Luis before you go is your wife on the same page\n[noise] ah my my family has and um we and and now we've got a cool place just like we should do it but still with like a reservation I mean what new at this point and so\nI understand that's what I say the the tough thing with new parents especially for still new parents is if\nIt's uh dissension between the two of you which causes tension if that's why I ask you if the whites on St paint or not because if she's not you get all the stress of that number one and number two if you feel they should because you've been convinced and she feels not that becomes a problem\nAnd that was an issue at one point and that we just talk to and I think now she's coming to conclusion that was like we should and I\nThat's one of the reasons why I called and when her doctors on I was like ... and it's I just say hey by the way you know I spoke to adopt a set age old say we should be offered a final should go ahead because these are some of that list that are about to say oh\nYeah there is too great and look they've been doing this for a long long time and and that's why I gave those stats you're not alone in questioning it and with the Internet people go search and they can find something that supports their thesis you know what I mean I'm ... but but as as David said the research shows it's valuable\nUm it helps and you're at risk I mean people do die and kids do die or in their head of\nThe social responsibility Louise let's say that you take your family to visit your parents um or anyone else it might be in from\nYour now imposing a significant risk on their health and you're going to be in shopping malls for people who are going to be an airplane so that the the uh ability for you to help minimize that risk or in the general population is another is another important responsibility\nSo I'm curious when you go talk to your wife have you have an issue call us back next week I'd love to hear but but yeah as Dr Cooper said it's a smart thing to do it's prudent it's not it shouldn't even be a choice but then again in today's world\nI'm with the the bubbling up of

I mean look ... ten has so many flaws and poorly conceived whenever you go to the ballot box to ah to make policy you're always going to end up with a with unintended consequences and I think Peter you've identified one of them\nLook a lot of Democrats out there remember the passage of three strikes and they remember there's a problem is that it was gonna make our community safer but then there was some unintended consequences right you had people going to prison for stealing a slice of pizza Republicans out there remember all these other ballot initiatives ones that promise tax hikes will be temporary but of course they ended up being permanent\nThis is a poorly conceived industry with many flaws you identified which is having a rent board having to tell you and by the way there is nothing in ... that protects what were they just said\nThose rent words could state this is the amount of rent you can charge this is the maximum you can charge for a one bedroom apartment is the maximum you can charge for renting your pool house it doesn't matter if it's ten thousand square feet or when thousands were ... they absolutely how this power and the ...\nLet me is is okay with you guys are going to take a call and I'll let you reach answer but let's go to the question first Randy in San Bernardino morning what's your question\nYeah I've been a property five years old enough to retire at ... property\nFor my retirement as I have no retirement I tell all book in fact if they were part of what they can read it down by the late ... back to the same thing that they say I'll do it\n... that much money\nAs you say my L. or the eight hundred thousand dollar [noise] what do you want me to celebrate\nBecause you're concerned you're right at the at that moment or it I'm going to let them answer you know what a ... if you want to ask you first of all\nJust in response to that Randy I'm once again there would not be it would actually be illegal for a local rent or to then say you have to reduce the rent because again you have a constitutional rights to a fair rate of return\nProposition ... in fact is the first time that that fair rate of return for a landlord has been codified in law prior to this we had case law in the courts that had basically said look rent control is perfectly legal as long as the landlord makes a fair rate of return but there was no specific law that said that top ten actually does that\nBut specifically to the to the concern that rent bored with telling you that you can't have a the rent at a at a certain price to begin with and would force you to lower rent that is not something that ... ten would do and again it wouldn't be able to do that because if you are actually losing money on your rental housing investment\nYou wouldn't be able to apply for an adjustment I in fact above\nThe rent control price or for your unit we already can do that in ... in Los Angeles in every single jurisdiction in California nothing changes on that Mike\nRandy thank you for your call and you raise a very very deep concern with prop time which I think is valid or you know this idea of a fair rate of return I mean who determines what's fair well it's these five hundred thirty nine you rental boards that could be created under prop ten I Will venture a\nYou know I don't know exactly what city is whether it's Santa Monica or West Hollywood or if it's Berkeley but the executive director of the use of rent control boards makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year paid for by the taxpayer\nAnd to add this bureaucracy to a guy like Randy who just wants to retire and enjoys retirement and help them fill out ten forms in triplicate twenty pages long to say gee I Want to get one percent which is a fair rate of return 'cause you know savings accounts for giving me zero point one percent\nThat is too much ... is a poorly conceived initiative with too many flaws and that's a big one of them and you've identified as\nWe only have a couple of moments you know it's like some more calls but I'm going for a big question and trying to accomplish okay so you've got all of a lot of mom and pops ... this is a story throughout California mom and pops who bought property rental property and the concern you could hear in his voice was a bit angry\nThe since the end when you read both sides of the prop you go well a lot of people are saying I'm going to throw in I'm not going to rent or I Would have bothering them getting convert all my units into ... and then I don't have to bother so now what you've done is you're just picking out a rental property so renting\nThe fewer properties the price goes up for the remaining property so if he is frustrated with that and decides to convert\nTo condos or is it kind of defeats in why wouldn't somebody do that or if you take the incentive away from a developer 'em and they're not making as much profit they may not take good care of the properties and I've been reading that as a as one of the\nThe ... the potential things that could happen where people just throw in so how do you answer that and again we only have about two three minutes I maybe\nI can show that well I mean I I mean I wanted to address a couple of things very quickly though\nBut so in terms of mom and pop landlords let's be very very clear about what the ... campaign is doing here and claiming it claims that it's in support of mom and pop landlords in fact the folks who are funding this campaign the vast majority of the enormous war chest that they've built\nAs a result of donations from private equity firms the biggest landlords not only in the state of California but in the country in fact we have been donating to the new one ten campaign\nThey've been pretending as or acting as though they're acting in the interests of mom and pop landlords\nMy mom is a mom and pop landlord my mum rents her own room but she knows I Know that my mother's single family room that she is renting out to to someone from her single family home is never going to be regulated under rent control in fact that's the question I Would throw to Mike in fact\nAt what point you know it's fine we talk about mom and pop landlords we're probably not going to regulate people like Randy I have a couple of single family homes at what point do do we start saying it's not acceptable for I don't know corporate landlords of a hundred single family homes\nThousands single family homes not to be regulated at all\nOr am I could get about two minutes so first of all that type of demagoguery is not going to cover up propped tens laws\nPeters not demagoguery gets the actual actually even look at who's funding the no on top ten campaign Peters crush route but your your entire campaign is funded by an eccentric millionaire who put in twenty five million we're also getting funding from the ... the California budget association might if you will end up you know you're not ... ... and\nDevelopers are not in this for charity there are certain immutable facts out there that everybody listening understands do you think\nThe developer for all the people listening do you think any developer is going to build the housing when you are they going to build a new apartments that will drive down rents are they going to put the supply in the market that will affect the demand\nIf their rate of return is controlled absolutely not they are not charities uh this this was the precise reason why this ... going to make the housing crisis far far worse because Peter indicated there is not one developer out

to address the bit about what the economists say recently mental pet store at USC released a study a actually showing that or or making the point that for a long time economists at a very simplistic model about how minimum wages worked for example\nAnd we've seen with the evidence over time that that's not you know minimum wages are actually positive at the at the very least for those who are making the minimum wage it's often it has no actual or very little impact on the on the broader labor market on on you know\nOn the economy as a whole right and so rent control policy should be understood in exactly the same way right we know from the evidence now that we're in control work several overworked staff to keeps people in their homes it also by the way as another study from UC Berkeley the ... Institute\nShowed rent control does not actually impact much on construction or on a you know on on the construction of new homes\nIn fact the law that we're trying to repeal right now ... via prop ten\nThey promised us at the time that suddenly by ... by passing this law there would be a flurry of new construction at the housing crisis in California would be solved\nI asked folks right now to ask themselves\nHow you know twenty three years after that law was passed was did that actually happened and we would say no it did not what it ended up doing was just incentivized\nLike bad behavior at best and the influx of corporate money into housing so they again there are simplistic models that slowly but surely the research is showing our old and outdated and don't account for the kind of moderate rent control policies that we have now\nHer to mark I asked about the economists and I also asked about cities for instance like San Francisco where rent control exist\nSo I'll tell you something about a KBC seven Ninety listeners are not stupid a these are by and large educated folks who understand things and ah one thing that you know I hear a lot of Democrats say is uh we're pro science I hear a lot of educated Republicans say the same thing\nStudy after study after study Harvard Stanford Berkeley insert your favorite ... university here\nThey have all come to the same conclusion that rent control does not work it's something that we all into it in our footing the fiber of our being you look at the cities with rent control right now a San Francisco highest rent from the state West Hollywood Beverley hills Los Angeles these are places are very high rent because they dry it drives the supply down\nIt also makes ... raise the rent when they get an opportunity because they think well gee I might have faced this rental board that that is going to affect my housing prices\nThis proposition ... proposition ten is going to uh you know I mean you don't really need those studies to understand\nThe basic concept that people will not construct housing and the ... fleet of business they will take their housing off the market they will sell it that will reduce the amount of rental units that are available to people\nOr the other fact that you know because it allows rank and file for single family residences you might even have people who are you know don't choose to retire here and she was a free to state these are not good things these are things that I don't think are byproducts that anybody wants to see but production would unfortunately put in place\nOkay when are you want to dress in going to take a call\nRight people are already fleeing the state might in fact something like a hundred and thirty thousand Californians left the state in the last year and they did so because if the cost of housing one shave them if you hire rent regularly in fact high rents once again the reason why we have the rental crisis that we have in woman in California is precisely because of rent control has been limited for twenty some odd years", "show_name": "The Peter Tilden Show", "station": "KABC", "day": "18", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
