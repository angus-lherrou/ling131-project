Shapiro show today we're going to talk about how feminism makes your hateful\nWhy is Donald Trump looking so confident\nHow the left uses language to follow us\nBut first I got to ask is the case against Brett Kavanaugh falling apart the New York times a former newspaper and used to be a newspaper but now what it is it is the talking point of the left that is the place where the left goes to find out what the planet like a little single you know they send up smoke signals from the New York times\nAnd they left regional New York times and then they know what the new strategy is\nSo today they announced that there is a shift in strategy for the left story by Cheryl ... is talking to the left what we're doing now\nA new front in the cabin all wars temperament and honesty democratic efforts to highlight sexual assault charges that are more than Thirty years old had been dismissed by supporters of judge Brett Kavanaugh as the dredging an ancient history but\nThe judges response to those accusations has raised new issues that go to the court of who President Trump's Supreme Court nominee is right now is truthful this partisanship and his temperament so pay attention to what they said all lives right\nSome people have said this is ancient history but a lot of people are just saying it's not true and that of course is what they're worried about it now got what they wanted they demanded an FBI investigation and they got it and now I have this feeling they're getting that they have a lot of sources the times on the FBI the FBI has been licking them forever I'm sure they're getting that they cannot\nDo the show we're shipping it to his temperament now what does that mean means a means they got nothing\nSo they're going to talk about his anger and and this is directed mostly to women because women get very frightened by mail anger I don't blame them men are bigger and they can be violent when men get angry women have this natural reaction when a lot of women saw Brett Kavanaugh\nProtesting his innocence in this angry voice\nThey have that reaction they got they said oh no no no no I did that I don't like at all\nBut let me talk about this for just a minute a judge who is an angry at the Lynch mob but it's coming after this man does not deserve to be a judge which actually isn't angry\nAt the site of a Lynch mob like what the leftist become and this story does not deserve to be a judge a lawyer who was ... at the site of moral panic\nOverriding due process of law should lose his license to practice law in goon man who loves justice and is not Paul beyond words what the Democrats the press and the left wing activists are doing right now today\nWould not be a good man and would not be a man who loves justice you want to know that just happened to those\nQualities and his his qualification to be a judge they've got three hundred plus decisions that he wrote that they can sit there and read instead of doing what they're doing is they're screaming and people in ... in elevators instead of\nTowering somebody's reputation sort of tell people what park on the supported uncorroborated accusations they could read his decisions and decide whether he has the temperament to do this\nIf Kavanaugh is a judge he shouldn't be enraged beyond all measure a lot of times you will hear me say\nThat anger is the devils cocaine and the reason I say that is because while some anger is righteous anger is not the same thing as righteousness but this is righteous anger he\nShould be angry from self you should be angry first family but more than anything else should be angry for the left to after left for stirring up the mob against due process and the rule of law so\nLet's look at the mob today in New York Times they're big big breaking story Kavanaugh was involved in a bar altercation at Yale okay here's the story as an undergraduate student at Yale red Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a local bar during which he was accused of throwing ice\nOn another patron according to a police report I called Batman right 'cause ... and\nDr ... was a guy name Arnold Schwarzenegger play them and Mr Freeze thank you very much Mr Freeze to obviously but I think we reveal the New York times and got them\nBrett Kavanaugh is Mr Freeze it was just that he was just Arnold Schwarzenegger pretending to be Brett Kavanaugh on the Internet which occurred in September Nineteen eighty five during Mr Kavanaugh's junior year resulted Mr cabinet and four other men being questioned by the New Haven police department by the way\nI my son went to Yale I'm sure these kind of push now there's a lot essentially what they're saying\nIs they're accusing Brett Kavanaugh of drinking in college which is like accusing him of having temper tantrums and he was two years old\nAnd really as if the New York times ran a front page story\nPolice reports show that Brett Kavanaugh's a two year old was throwing blocks and crying loudly and ... mothers rushed to the scene of is angry ranch ways are still ... is this kind of temperament you want and it's like he was never supposed to be young he was never supposed to do things in India we shouldn't do\nWhat you want to stand before that judge I mean isn't that amazing would you want to stand before a judge would never done anything wrong couldn't understand what people were and what you know how they act in when they were young and had no compassion unbelievable unbelievable story it is just the ... just about the fact\nThat the real charges the chargers didn't matter\nAre falling apart MSNBC this isn't just an amazing piece of video I got to play for you they had Julie sweating it on like she's a woman who said that there were these gang rape parties like ten of them and I went to ten of them [laughter]\nYou know stop you know it's like Julie stopped going to the gang rape parties you know when you get the invitation that says please come to my gang rape already\nKnow don't don't totally gang rape party stay home watch TV you know Netflix and she'll you know like do not go to the but Kate Snow within an NBC reporter and I I I really feel for her because as a journalist she's interviewing women and she can tell this woman\nStory is unraveling so she starts to ask her about discrepancies\nYou did she really mean in her statement that she made to the committee did she mean these things so she starts off by asking her\nA sweat and it said that she saw Kavanaugh's bike the punch so he could get women drunk to prepare them for the satanic a date right I think there's a de Raymond Newman sacrifices that would ... you know the usual thing that happens at least part I mean are we going to hold him accountable and\nListen to even watch on screen as their story falls apart\nAgency Brett Kavanaugh you know spiking of pine should put in my life I I saw him getting red solo cups teen girls during that time frame and they're ... as parties and I would not take one of those classes from bark half of them in fact catalog excuse me [noise]\nI saw him around the punch I won't say malls or the punch containers\n[noise]\nNine fifty talk radio seven Ninety cages the pills in at ten [noise] ladies and gentleman so ah [noise]\nJust face host the emperor of Amazon\nAnnounced yesterday that he was raising the wages of all Amazon and whole foods workers to a minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd this includes a\nThe two hundred and fifty thousand Amazon employees plus one hundred thousand seasonal work [noise]\nAnd it begins November first\nAnd this applies to whole foods employees do their Amazon employees\nI did just say that by the way I Know you're listening to handle but I did just say that ah nonetheless uh you're so that was for me [laughter]\nAnyway ladies and gentlemen and listen to handle there's nothing you can do it but you can't listen to bowl shows at the same time\nUh but uh\nThis comes after he a base has taken a lot of heat from Bernie Sanders and others but specifically Bernie Sanders ... wasted no time to give props to ... pesos\nAnd to encourage more companies to follow suit and you may see more companies or follow suit you may see for instance Walmart which raised their minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nYou may see them respond as well because part of what we've got going on right now is sort of a wage war for seasonal employees especially with the holidays coming up\nIs a lot of jobs that have to be filled and this is what you want to see happen this is what happens with supply and demand in a booming economy the advantage goes to the workers and this move certainly is good news for\nYou know a lot of people by the way it's very expensive\nUh the Fifteen dollars the current minimum wage of seven twenty five federally\nSo this is more than doubling in a lot of location you know they got big facilities in Kentucky and places like that that don't have California wages so it's a big big salary hike\nFor the Amazon workers and then it's significantly more in Costa Amazon because the wages are only part of the costs and you've got FICA contributions and all of that stuff\nSo a ... it's a it's a great expense now we're not going to have to have a bake sale to bailout Jeff Bass so they can afford it he wouldn't be making this move if you didn't think it was in the interest of his company's bottom line and now by the way having gotten out in front on this issue\n... is using this quote unquote moral authority uh that's my word that his but he's using that a street cred that he's got now on the issue to lobby for a an increase in the federal minimum wage which I mentioned to seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour now\nWe've discussed this many times the minimum wage is not ever intended to support families than put people through college but uh it is kind of hard to imagine\nMaking seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour modern day America anyway I don't care you can go to Idaho you go to some low cost place to live gas is still what it is and so as a purchasing a car and so is insurance and so of groceries et cetera\nWell ideally it would be for you know teenagers who still live at home but are making a little money on the side of the problem is when the recession if you're in a lot of people the only jobs they could find for minimum wage job right\nThat's not so much the case anymore and that's one of the reasons why we're starting to see the wages increase companies increase those wages because if they're going to fill those positions\nThey need to attract workers especially as I mentioned with the holidays coming up that hiring is going on now if you've been to the stores you know they already got the Christmas

Orange County cumulus station [noise] they'd\nStaff has been trained and we'll be able to identify complaint that could trigger the ordinance the garbage discrimination complaints against city elected officials\nUnder city law the personnel department most informed the mayor or the council president when receives a complaint of discrimination or sexual harassment against an LA elected official and then the panel most convened to examine the allegations he said the delay occurred because agencies staffers\nDidn't recognize that the complaint targeted an elected official really okay it was a very broad complaint that made it difficult to identify specific charge in addition he told the times yesterday aired last month when he said we use our complaint dealt with allegations of discrimination harassment and retaliation\nHe said now it's only discrimination so that's the story changed he's here comes the BS or why it took so long what was in the charges a he said I take this matter seriously and denied discriminate against any current or former staff members and I look for for full transparent expeditious resolution\nOr the department's changing stories and the delay um make you start to wonder about my voice LA ah and then if something is done to you by a city or a specially somebody high ranking\nOr just how you're going to be treated so guards said he said he wasn't wasn't been formed it hadn't been informed of away and he said it's fun to\nThe pointing but it shouldn't be used for any complaint not being handled promptly\nSo by the way if you're an employer California\nYou are required to address allegations of workplace harassment and discrimination properly if you fail to do so what happens is the worker can expect to be exposed to it and continuing behavior and being discriminated against so it's it's more of an opportunity for harm\nSo here over the last few weeks they offer different explanations explanation hey he said the department staff failed to identify that we use our complaint because the website was in testing mode and like a formal system for tracking complaints\nReally so what you put it up and you got complaints but you had no way to track them brilliant you also said no work at the done on the complaint during the nearly three months have passed between the day was followed the day what's in was informed of his existence that\nSeveral days later he said his previous explanation was incorrect and that each complaint received by my voice LA including the one targeting who use art\n... was review the week it was filed how do you know so it went from beta testing where they had enough you to review them to oh no it was ... it was reviewed um\nThey found a complaint one day after it was received seven began processing it reaching out to the accuser still he said the complete should have been forward it to us so much sooner than\nThe department staffed inform us in the complaint on September thirteenth and that's when he gave the instructions to form the committee or the special committee on investigator oversight now must decide whether complaint Syrian us seriously enough to want the hiring of an independent investigator\nSo and remember um west and the last time that result was closed\nThe sexual harassment and a job discrimination et cetera ... western base will be called him my best friend because I was right when he was running for his next time so you\nGot you got Jose we use our\nWho had an a sexual harassment case against him by a former I'm assistant and this assistant said that he retaliate against her when she refused to provide them with sexual favors\nHe said they're fake he said it was an extramarital affair however he never asked for sexual favors and never hurt her as far as your job if he\nIs the city had paid a settlement to her in that case I guess what would've happened we would have known about it because I had to be public so privately they settled so now here's the message you got\nHey if we use or does anything because they we use our I'm guessing any other city council members and you follow the complaint on the hotline and like my voice LA you're going to get be stories back again to alternating stories about how the Tamil number two you can sit there after this claim and make a private settlement\nSo nothing gets out and you can continue to run because we don't have any transparency ... year like the city council and we and we have no idea what happened even though the woman who worked for you had her annual salary grow from forty seven thousand two hundred and thirty two thousand we can't ask why\nDid she all of a sudden get better or what you're doing four times the work or was it because she knew seven positions that your wife doesn't know that she got the extra money is that a wink wink nod nod could that be it\nShe did things to you oh my God that she did she did a hundred and five hundred thirty thousand dollars worth of things to you that we paid for we have no idea but and we will never know\n'cause it was paid it was paid privately so I guess you can do that um she said she was denied promotions forcing her to transfer um she got another job at the city by\nThe way and are there you go so you can so if you're him and there's a claim against you if you're if you're Jose we use our you can subtle one claim you can have another one that is be asked and bounced around with different answers and then I talk about on the radio yesterday and all of a sudden and I'm not saying that because all of a sudden\nThe discrimination plane was mishandled and they came out with this story a late yesterday early this morning it's pretty pretty wild and that's part of this it's it's how how men are accused of something or treated 'em and\nWhat is the rule when something like this happens I guess on city council if you have power you get to keep your power and now not only do you get to keep your power but as a gift you know you give your wife and actually your seats you actually hand over your seat and with name recognition she may actually who knows if you win a ...\nA pretty pretty stunning that my voice LA the website we know nothing about that we think they initiated it to help people men and women who were sexually accosted who had problems want to do this and they trust the city to do it in already\nYou find out that it's tainted and it's got to stick to it already the department just keeps changing changing the stories\nI Love it I Love when the story that they change it to a has nothing to do with a B it's not even linear it's not we weren't testing and we couldn't track oh that was wrong how did he get that information so if you'd like to comment on that on how we use are just continues to take the salary who's going to get his pension\nYou're able to settle privately it doesn't come out or when you're sitting in a job that should have transparency and now they're claiming here with this like my voice LA that will be transparency and I guess we should trust them because it's so if you want to come on that\nA comment on that eight hundred to two to five to two troops also does tie in to the president going after Christine Blasey Ford last night or during his rally which is ... interesting because like I said it offended many than most Lindsey Graham not so much and not tell you what he said but I guarantee there's a group out there are ... a big group\nSpecifically men who say you know what I'm Glad he's pushing back I'm Glad his son's pushing back\nBecause this movement it's unfair unfair and I'm sure you want to comment on that eight hundred to two to five to to to uh and it is interesting to the cropped up yesterday from the sun\nAnd then from the father and for about four days it was really gentle remember the president has said that after seeing her testimony he said it was compelling and it was credible so what changed my question to you is is this going to hurt in the midterms with women voters not come out because of this or will democratic women voters\nBe motivated will it's which anybody's mind I'm a or B will it actually embolden a GOP voters to come out because they feel that a seminar got a raw deal and there's also some new cabinet and there was a I'll be giving you every day we get\nSome new allegations new information I'm In new pieces to this puzzle about what happened thirty six years ago between\nA cabin on in his accuser so Jeff Flake right now one of the swing vote I mean with the president doing this\nAnd coming out and I'm going after her last night you realize you got only one vote you can afford to lose a in this thing's in ... in trouble in the house so in the Senate so\nIs this ... did that appealed to what he did last night that I did that appeal to a Murkowski or Collins or flake or even a Joe mansion and the Democrats in red state in West Virginia\nDid that change their mind or did that paint them they tried to get a take on college this morning when she was going to to work um she said she was unhappy about what he said but did not commit to whether she would vote or not so if\nYou want to comment on a on what the president said last night why he attacked her and what the outcome will be from his attack directly abroad side right right on the victim um what is the outcome of that going to be isn't going to pack in impact the midterms and also\nI like city councilman claim was made sat there for three months now are getting BS stories about it paid off an accuser will be able to retire from the seat get his pension and I guess in his ... certain people you're in a position where you don't have to pay you don't have to pay if you did something that you can write a check\nAnd it'll go away and then you you keep your seat another claim comes in there may be run the clock on that one\nYou get your pension and maybe your wife goes in so she can then get her pension what an amazing what an amazing an amazing opportunity you have in the city councilman and what do you think about that ... lack of transparency not only for what he did but for my voice LA for the website\nWhere he got this complaint I Love that they messed up what the complaint was they messed up when it came in they messed up how it was handled and they messed up the explanations

that's worth reading a lot of men out I'm not that she's not credible not that she doesn't believe the story happen not the story may have happened um and spin it directly the way she says or some

McConnell\nAbout that the Senate will vote this week on the show called the majority leader or and so on one hand you know there is a a lot of pressure to get this done really really quickly on the

or may not have spoken with and that what they need to do is take the time to get this right and so they are under a lot of doing pressures and ultimately\nUm they are going to have it for finding of some kind of we don't know yet whether I'm you know how is that what form that report will pay cool we'll be able to see it but you're right there's going to be a lot of pressure I think from a lot of different sides for this report\nTo be hard on can you imagine Michael ... who has been the annoying to a lot of people on both sides he has some accusers and they've turned their not credible from what we're hearing right now can you imagine if the confirmation is rushed and some of these people turn out to be credible and do have\nAre corroborating evidence wants the seat and nominated and the Democrats will be in charge you know what the Russians ... they didn't want to hear they didn't want to know and now you can do just continue to attack that can be a total mess\nAnd the real key really is and as we talked about earlier it goes back to whether\nJeff Flake Lisa Murkowski into the column believe that the FBI investigation was Thoreau enough\nFor them to be satisfied with\nUh what the FBI did or didn't find that's what I was going to come back to because on both sides of the senators who have the\nMajority of Democrats who are going to oppose cabinet and you have the majority of Republicans who are going to support him so the key question when this report because that is not just the finding but also will just lay it will ... will Lisa Murkowski say you know what we're satisfied with the number of interviews they did with how deep they got\nInto some of these allegations or are they going to say well hold on a second this is not the investigation we envision this is not a the debt that we thought that this would go into that does happen then that's going to stop trouble for Republican leaders because if they lose a you know two out of those three Republicans that I just mention\nIs she right on it and then they will be able to get that they won't be able to do for a cabinet shop Democrat stick together so it's a ... it's a really you know

front of me but when he was four years old he got two hundred thousand bucks when he was seven years old he got a millionaire and he kept growing and growing and growing because they wanted to shield the wall so it's not taxable\nThe key points were ... dad died they avoided five hundred million dollars in taxes basically by skirting around it a legal we and then they're putting themselves out there with their lawyers and fact checking thing and fraudulent and the and this number one and that\nTrump lied about his wealth and that is a successful businessman is all created is it's all fraud is all fake\nNo on cracking up when I see this because I thought really people didn't leave he said he got one million dollar loan and and he paid them back and I always said because I'm from the east coast are known of Trump's used to come on the show\nUh what did they think happened to his dad's wells his dad was one of the wealthiest men in America they saw when he died he did what was the money of course it went to the ... I'm shocked that people did not know the terms father left him in the mountains it was around four hundred and forty million dollars\nOr so is this a huge bombshell is this going to change anybody's mind about anything\n[noise] well we'll see I mean with the election coming up a\nAbout a month from now we'll see if there is an issue that affects about what we do know now that it is I'm drawing more scrutiny to Trump's a\nFinancial background and in fact the New York ... is actually getting a probe or in the wake of this report so we might get more of an investigation into this but um you know this is another story that focuses on the president and um his personal background his family's\nFinancial background so you know ... again when you look at the midterms um this is the kind of thing that in really conservative areas might anger and galvanized conservative voters and say you know have president on ... you know is being used for a life that\nWe don't agree with that we want to get out support him but on the other hand you talked about some of these\nSuburban swing areas particularly in the battle for the house this could be a another reason that gives voters paws for voting for Republican candidates Trump's party out with\nYou but this is even going to national it was a big piece but he's even going to resonate because it seems to be a ... a story that overshadows another story so with this confirmation going on is this story even have legs the New York times bigger was that\nThat's the protests will question when it comes to any development Trump because as you know I mean we've seen this time and again\nOver the last two years when you have really really significant revelations are developments about law often times uh\nSigned another development on a totally different front\nYou know one or two days later or a week later and so you know after a couple of weeks things you know that that were very very significant or sometimes forgotten um\nGiven everything else that has transpired and we're in a week right now where there's a lot going on however that Kavanaugh's nomination gets resolved is certainly going to be a top of mind issue for a lot of voters around the country it's been getting nonstop news coverage everywhere uh\nYou look and so um you know I think a lot of a lot of Americans are focused on that right now that\nI'm that he may you know pick up a lot of their attention as they prepare to the polls\nIn November ... before I let you go I'm curious the Democrats who is the front runner number one number two what's the messaging

who's leading the charge at this point who's a leading voice I mean you've got ... show all over the place and so kind of murky and I don't know what the message has yet\nIt is very very unsettled at this point because you have a what is expected to be a historically large field of Democrats potentially running for president in twenty twenty you don't have a situation like you did in two thousand sixteen where from the outset it was clear that Hillary Clinton was the front runner and\nWithout you know a clear leader right now there is a battle of the Democratic party to define the future of the party not just in terms of the ideas that the party embraces the also the tone right that it takes on one hand\nYou have a lot of candidates who believe that the future of the party should be rooted in policy arguments for things like Medicare\nFor all free college tuition on the other hand you have you know some potential candidates who embrace the opportunity to go toe to toe with Trump take him on and a very ... very personal way and then you'll have candidates who you know have ties to the task potential Joe Biden is seen as somebody who might\nRun for president but you also have a\nYou know in New emerging field of candidates who haven't been er at the highest levels national office before people like Elizabeth Warren and the Senate correct right or you know\nI'm ... and some governors as well so we could see you know dozens potentially doesn't mean a democratic candidate it's you know I Am ready that goes on\nAnd on and on and you're right in a while that's happening
