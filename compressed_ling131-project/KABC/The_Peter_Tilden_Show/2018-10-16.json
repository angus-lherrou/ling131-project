series\nAnd the Dodgers cannot afford to lose tonight's game you can't go down three games to one\nOr two a team as good as Milwaukee with that kind of pitching so it really is going to be I think all hands on deck for the Dodgers tonight uh they they need to win tonight and ideally both uh tonight and tomorrow afternoon game\nSo that they can go back to Milwaukee up three to a and only need to win one on the road or to go back to the world series but this ah Milwaukee team is powerful and you're pitching is much better than we were led to believe their starting pitching yesterday was sensational\nUh and the Dodgers like the New York Yankees have often said spilled on walks and homers and it's not it doesn't do a lot of small ball and last night was a perfect example of what the risks are with an ... that is constructed like that because they are they were fourteen strike outs and pretend with runners and storing position\nThat he can't win when your score zero at the end of

they need to sanction [noise]\nUm it really depends what the administration wants what did you want to do is it looking for a similar way we dress any\nPolitically inconvenient Wayne make this thing go away do they want to punish the Saudis severely is the president indicated a day or so ago I did live you know alter the fundamental character their relationship to ensure that\nI'm more of a surprise city in it and then our ally not our ally our security partner simply cannot go around behaving the way that they've been behaving over the last year I Would I Would not put my money on that one this is where I think we should do because we we do have a stake in upholding our values and our interests\nI think they'll find try to find some way to demonstrate they're upset and then ah quickly if they can return just relationship to as much of a business as usual proposition as quickly as possible\nHow about the rest of the world [noise] well the rest of the world I mean look the international community is not terribly courageous and heroic and I would put ourselves at the top of the list here too\nSo in responding violations of human rights I mean after all think about it since the beginning of the of the Yemeni civil war and twenty fifteenth thousands of Yemen these powers including hundreds of children had been killed\nUsing a American supplied a fueled\nA Saudi ... aircraft\nAnd you know your mom's a friend of mine and I you know I'd every life is he's Supreme value and I'm I mourn his passing but you also have to consider that reality the Obama administration and the Trump Administration\nHave enabled the Saudis to continue to prosecute this insane war without in show and what has anybody done in respect to do with respect to the terrible humanitarian tragedy of Yemen complete with cholera cholera outbreaks and famine\nSo um you know I don't think the international\nCommunity you know see serious to see any of the large scale mass killings or injure imprisonment of ... by the Chinese I mean not only the Trump Administration I responded very few people have been able to respond effectively so I'm not imagining much\n[noise] you know I agree with that is it's interesting though I read an article that said that um some of the\nThere was anxiety among you were a surprise when they learned that foreign officials and at least four countries that properly discussed ways to manipulate yard crush or by taking advantage of his business dealings financial difficulties and the lack of foreign policy experience according\nTo current informing U.S officials familiar with the intelligence about the discussions and one of the countries the United Arab Emirates see Saudi\nAlly so how are we\nAre we being played what is what are the Saudis look at American policy as how much can we get away with\nA because they need us a there was also kind of an interesting thing in that a piece an opinion piece was panned by the guy who owns or heads the state owned a news network or bio I guess what's called her a BA Libya where he openly talked about using all as a weapon that the President Trump's anger about eighty dollar\nRail nobody should rule out the jumping to a hundred dollars and two hundred dollars a barrel which is unprecedented um because they can bring the world to the news with or production of reserves\nSo there's all the moving parts of your so what do you think about than I ever the of those doing the negotiations and Jared Kushner although I understand he's reported everything and he's always with partners who have experience\nWell they're the reality is that we have a lot are hopes for Saudi Arabia and had been so non to exceed expectations we were only charged him is some sort of a progressive democratic reform or even though it that's not how he describes himself\nAnd he has a negotiated at least two very important to\nInitiatives one is women driving even while he jails um those leading women activists who started this movement in he's curtailed to a large degree the behavior and functions of the religious police in Saudi Arabia and ...\nThat's all very important but we have allowed that to mask the reality of his ruthlessness and its authority Teri and I'm proclivities\nSo I Do I Believe we are being used and abused by a Saudi Arabia you bet ya I Do which is why as I mentioned we don't have to aggregate your relationship there are clear national interest for having ties and maybe even close ties with us but we have to recalibrate\nWe have to make it an mistake really clear that you cannot kill\nA dissidents or journalists abroad if you want to support you cannot to temporarily came the prime minister of Lebanon and basically forced him to do a hostage video you cannot continue and we will not support you\nIn Yemen unless you commit yourself and the Iranians and who the who are also responsible\nFor large measure this tragic situation\nNeed to do their part but if in fact you drawn no restraints no constraint you impose a no limits\nThan you know what happens leaders begin to think rightly\nThat taken basically you get away with just about anything and while I'm not trying any causality the killing disappearance and presume killing of your most of the show she is on Saudi Arabia is not on the Trump Administration\nBut the reality is if you enable you empower you allow a an ally or an adversary to\nContinue to be have without constraint or limitation then they assume literally they can get away with anything\nIncluding talking Aaron David Miller vice president for new initiatives and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars\nAaron you have negotiated in the middle East I'm in State Department for both sides and you're in an advisor an Arab Israeli negotiations um you were there attempting to deal with Israel Jordan Syria the Palestinians what is Mike Pompeo than\nSaying to the crown prince ... when when when people things over there and he's going to say on the we're not going to take this what do you actually say in those negotiations what does that like because we saw the smiling\nToday the objects that they were smiling with each other but somebody knows one player said yeah that's the kind of guys and Midwest guy and you're on camera you smiling Hi how are you\nBehind closed doors he's going to hit this this crown prince hard what does that meal\nLet's presume I worked for Jim Baker or right I just tweeted out now more than an hour ago the ... you know there there isn't that the body language of appeals me with the king in fact he praised the size for comprehensive through untimely investigation let's hope that's just\nTo create a degree of political space\nAnd at the message both for the king and mom and been so non was much tougher\nBut frankly in my view the days when Jim Baker was slamming notebooks and telling a Israeli prime ministership near the late President Assad of Syria and even the Palestinians that in essence a you know unless you wise up\nIs going to be a long time since ... before I come back here I mean I was in meetings with Becker when he said that that would do my palm pay oh he's a tough guy smart guy\nIs that what he's saying to mom and been so mine that you better we we need to know exactly what happened and\nWhat you will role in this was in the future of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia\nIs at stake Bush forty one backed up your back\nIs Donald Trump than a backup Mike bump pale\nA we have no idea what transpired in those conversations but I I Would I Would be very surprised and they may have been tough question becomes what are we going to do to follow up our words with the\nWell and I'm looking at Congress looks like right now Lindsey Graham is saying never deal with them yeah nothing happens in Saudi Arabia on M. B. us knowing it he's on the bedrock I can never do business again until this behind us and he actually said he had just gotten murdered expect me to ... I feel used and abused\nHe's toxic he can never be a world leader on the road state\nThat's well that that's Marco Rubio you kind of same kind of language so Congress angry making moves kinda these kinds of threats mean anything\nWell it could if in fact you get Congress to impose sanctions if they vote as they can to suspend arms sales if they ah create a situation where a there are so concerned about Saturday behavior in Yemen\nAnd the killing of civilians that they essentially you impose restrictions on the administration's capacity\nIt's the worst boss you are trying to think of the worst boss I ever had we can talk about that when we get back uh eight hundred to two to five to two to Peter to in the tank continues right after the next [noise]\nThe band the local that ten thirty I'm Rob marine go Kevin daily own says ... is gaining a democratic incumbent\nDianne Feinstein and the race to represent California in the Senate\nSays he has come from relative that's scary through the primaries and now we're faced Feinstein in the November election\nAll the coal has decided to let them points to another one as a single digits that it quite so are are were trending nicely\nHe said he proposes three debates about let down by Feinstein tomorrow he will have a conversation with his opponent that will be streamed online but not broadcast\nWish it was a debate form or where you can actually debates on the values of the fish in your ... let's California but to it's lighter\nKevin daily I'm with the gas mcentire in the morning ...
