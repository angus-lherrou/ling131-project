to today Megan Kelly now being put on the outs by NBC for ridiculous reasons we'll get to that but we begin today with all of the updates on the suspected attempted bombing attacks\nOn Democrats across the country the latest with regard to the state of quote unquote attempted male bonding is that it is possible that the bombs themselves are not actually structured to detonate\nSo olive hunted over at hot air right judging by some by social media Glenn and a piece story and thought it was claimed the explosive powder inside the bomb was harmless not sell\nA package and CNN and pain to pipe bomb and in love with a mystery powder inside it's mystery pattern it's harmless\nThe bombs themselves are supposedly workable and functional if crude although there are other report\nThat suggests that the bombs lack a detonator and so this was either a test run or a hoax or something else like that we're still waiting more information and that is today awaiting more information yesterday I thought there were a bunch of folks who jumped to the false flag explanation now I'm not claiming\nThat you're not allowed to speculate inside your own head as to who you think of this or that you're not allowed to wonder whether there's enough information to get on one side of the other what I'm saying is if you are one hundred percent sure this is a false flag you went right there like right away he just went to this is probably the Democrats helping themselves\nThat's not good okay you shouldn't be using confirmation bias and substitute for evidence and this is true in so many cases in our politics I Can't even tell you I've been saying for years I mean I remember when with Michael Brown case Michael Brown black guy shot by a cop and\nEnormous lots of ... the entire law basically said this is the case of police racism in retaliation which man was shot in the back because he was black\nAnd I said well let's wait for more evidence and then the evidence came out and it turns out that wasn't the story at all oh here if you're jumping through either this is Democrats' helping themselves or this is Donald Trump planting bombs in the mailbox you'll rent CNN let me suggest you that you're totally\nOf crap you know I Know you don't know yet because no one knows yet\nI don't know yet you don't know yet the press don't know yet and anybody suggesting they know who did this or why it was done or what the connection is to any particular political party is wind to you they don't have the information yet now there's some indicators that\nSomething weird is going on around me and what did this the\nPerson who should be put in jail forever and the person who is doing this has now sent one of these packages to Robert Deniro I guess and then on to Maxine Waters and a picture of the of one of the bombs in and bureau appears to have a parody of an ISIS flag taken from a mean that was circulating on right wing corners and the Internet than twenty fourteen\nAccording to NBC News the print that appears to show a parody flag there are places Arabic characters with a silhouette of three women in high heels in the middle inscription reading get her done which is a catch phrase of Larry the cable guy\nDaily Beast Laughlin marquee for ... the image that appeared inside the explosion package sent the CNN time or a building an address to running or striking similarity the black and white flag of the terror group\nAnd then they confirmed this was in fact in ISIS flag parity so this is leading people on the left to suggest that really what is is is a a right wing host and people on the right just as the left wing hopes and again again you don't know\nI don't know nobody knows but here's what I Do know I don't really believe that this is a person who sits up night thinking President Trump is telling me to go bomb people I think this person is a crazy person I think this person if he loomed bad who wants to pursue violence how do I know that because they're sending bombs from Robert De Niro\nRobert De Niro this ... this is not somebody who's smacks of I'm a I'm a sophisticated domestic terrorists with a serious political agenda deeply intertwined with the workings of modern politics and here's where it gets dangerous I said yesterday people who are immediately jumping to Trump's rhetoric caused this or the media's rhetoric cause that\nThose people are undermining the first amendment because the first amendment basic guarantee is it if I Am not inciting violence in my incitement to violence I mean saying go bomb someone\nThan I Am not responsible for your violent actions you know who's responsible for the ...\nThe guy who put together bombs and mailed them to people that's the guy responsible not President Trump not TNN that any of these folks justice Bernie Sanders was not responsible for a Bernie Sanders supporter going and attempting to shoot up a congressional baseball game and justice Brock Obama was not responsible for eight apparent fan of rock Obama trying to shoot up police officers in Dallas\nPresident Trump is not responsible for this to me they're not responsible for this and I don't have to wait for the outcome to know that you know why because the sort of rhetoric that President Trump's you had to have you as much as I dislike it as much light ripped it on this program for years he has never once said go mail bombs to my political opponents\nAnd shouting lock her up is not the same thing and saying mail her a bomb it may in fact lead people to condemn each other at higher rate we talked about that yesterday but it is not in fact incitement to violence the center for incitement to violence is extraordinarily high end or American law as well it should be\nPresident Trump reacted to all of

I'm\nSeeing a report that came up on 'em media I and I'm trying to always want to give the clarity to see where it came from the city's origin Republican was arrested in two thousand two for making a bomb threat is that also what you're hearing\nUh that that's one of the things I've read yes\nI got it but we have no more and they're not giving out much information out Jeff Sessions is going to do a A R D O G is going to do a press conference and give us all these I'm assuming at eleven thirty our time and I'm guessing the FBI is going to be there in New York police was going to be there and all the agencies that were involved they are going to have representatives there to answer questions\nYeah I don't know if this is including the NYPD or if this is truly D.C based on that one hundred percent sure if if I'm New York's police commissioner will be involved in this\nNot in anything else about the van 'cause I was ... you know the question is why are they covering with the ... they want the public not to see the stickers and my understanding is\nWhenever they do interest like this they try and protect the integrity of the van 'cause it's a crime it's basically crimes and exactly and we can take off hair it could if there's rain or whether you could compromise the van\nAnd anytime there there has been a I'm a terror investigation that that I've reported on and it evolved vehicle that the vehicle when it was that the U.S has been covered like that presumably to preserve evidence so yes\nAnd do we know married with children job was the job they keep saying he was a it was ... they got him at the auto zone and they were waiting there were actually following them gifts to do it in a way that wouldn't um the least amount of possibility for something to go wrong or civilian to be heard does he work at that autism is that his job\nI don't know yet again I've been um a quite busy reporting on this guy so I haven't had a chance to read the guy that I Know we're uh we're in lying out there right now yeah to a fast paced yeah well I thank\nYou for that or you know it is flying fast and furious and thank you for a given this report Steve ... a month I must be news contributor as casting bomb and thanks they've always got always you're always appreciated\nUm so that's what we know let me see if there's anything else I could add to that again we don't know if he's the only person if he's the primary person if he's an accomplice if there are complex as if there are other bombs out there\nUm so we don't know the details of the reason for the rest of the New York connection which I've been hearing all morning trying to get clarity on what that means we jokingly said\nEverybody has that the van they're going to use for\nDNA hear evidence to see if there's a bomb parts in there that look like the other bomb they're also going to be looked at it and see if there are surveillance video now that they depend on to find the van anywhere\nOr that they can linked to purchasing of items of are going to someone's home from George Soros et cetera um and as I said the department of justice will carry it live\nIs going to do in a press conference at eleven thirty were I'm sure they'll give us more clarity we don't know if they're new more packages out there yet um we don't know again if these would have gone off if they are capable of going off and this was just to instill fear\nOr if they were just poorly designed and he was in that because he's never done it before although in two thousand two according to the reports\nUm he was he was arrested for making a bomb threat then um we actually have a gentleman on the line where we will and just in a second Tom Fiore a with the west Broward community management manager who ran over there I think he was across\nThe street at the time and give us some more insight hopefully on this Tom good morning thanks for coming on hey good morning how are you good man so you work right across the street from the on his own\nThat is correct and we are right across the street\nSo what did you see let me get some background to you first of all your former detective who served in memory or Marines right okay I got my ... your arm by the way when you ran over there\nAre no no I was not\nEr so what did you see what what what's gone on your radar all of a sudden this morning\nCourage show or one of my co workers had report it to me that there was this suspicious white SUV sitting on the side of the building\nUm and ah it appeared that the individual binoculars so I decided that I Would feel the best um as I went outside I noticed that it was a white Ford Expedition and uh you know as a single white fail at it and I noticed some ...\nSo it kind of struck me as a possibility that it could be a law enforcement covered show one of the employees came in um through our backdoor where that's where he was parked and asked you know who is this person so I ... I went to question the end of it individual um as I approached his vehicle\nI'm off to my eyes hurt and then saw a very a loud bang and a flash up like a it is what appear to that it's flashback which is typically are regularly years that law enforcement um which was used to uh\nYou know it's it's used to\nDisoriented right or to distract\nAnd distract exact show [noise] um I saw that that had occurred I immediately started to run towards the the bank um and the individual that was part and the SUV next to me turned on his lights and took off to block off the street so obviously he was an undercover\nUm during that time as I started to run torch\nUm the auto zone is separated by a very large a major highway a stateless Adams so I ran up to the\nSide of the highway at which time that I observed a probably close to fifty law enforcement officers from all different jurisdictions um I did notice FBI and I also noticed ah folks from up and like pd\nUm once I saw the NYPD I immediately put you on that you are together believed that it was the bombing suspect after watching the commissioner on the TV [noise]\nWell ... ... and did they try and move you out of the anybody approach you to get out of the way beyond human jeopardy\nYes um show there were several like we'll call them civilians are bystanders that were in the area or on the several unmarked officers you know told everybody to get back\nOn that area wasn't safe\nShow um you know we of course did backup lever later advised by the local city all of the city of plantation police implement that\nUm that come over and advised that we needed to vacate the building because of the possibility of a threat to the bottom [noise] um we my boss argued\nSt network customer service to us and we've got to get some work done um so we have um you know I mean we're wearing a safe building I feel we're in a safe distance so he stayed and I continue to watch you know as as things progressed as I'm sure you can see on the television made them watching everything live right\nHere you know we didn't see the apprehension we didn't see if it was via a violin take down we didn't see how they took them to you know trying to solve their war no\nThere were no um yeah there was no media here when they take down happened um it appeared to be rather\nA quick and I'm very well planned um\nAnd plus he wouldn't say you defensive was the fighter was there any kind of a fight or any kind of resistance when they tried to take them in\nReal life so you know it it's kinda hard to comment on the situation like that because you know I mean an officer would play a flash bang for a couple of\nDifferent reasons sure so you know I don't even want to check it outside on that the only thing that I can tell you is that um you know I did not see any physical ... ... you know out\nExcessive by any means type of force from the suspect or for law enforcement\nAre made up here to go down relatively easy a\nThey're suspect had kind of a demeanor of looks like they got me\nJohn I'm done resigned resigned to the fact that he was caught 'em and what we did appear\nKeep seeing them covering the van to keep the integrity of the van and uh and put the tarp on and so they can take it away or we is there anything else that maybe we're not seeing\nOr is in in relation to the van we see all the stickers all over the band was anything strike jumped out at you\nWe're all there because you know what is what's gonna happen next\nUm the the um the narrative we'll begin with very little information or him for the information and people start claiming things again just like to do with the false flag no they'll take the next piece of information and run with it and and they could fit their box\nSo that it it applies to to their their tribe so we're getting more information we'll see the one piece of information\nBecause I just heard was that the DNA in on the least one package was linked to the suspect um and I'm just guessing they'd been following him for quite a bit but didn't necessarily put it out there so we'll keep you posted we're going to do a little bit of baseball talk for a moment if you want to participate in that\nEight hundred to two to five to ... to ...

mean I'm In the strategic you do this all the time Mr Roberts neighbors a\nDoes he ever contract for next year they waiting for this to see\nAll right just the fact that we're talking about a contract situation for a man\nWhen three years with the Dodgers was won three straight division titles and it's got to the Dodgers to back to back World Series and itself tells you everything you need to know about how precarious state Robert situation is with the Dodgers the fact is he does not have a contract for next year in fact he did have an option for next year that was not\nExercising go by the Dodgers now the reports are they've been negotiating a contract extension but let's go back to when they won the national league championship series against the brewers after\nThe game interviews are being done stand cast and was there Andrew Freedman other Dodger officials were there Dave Roberts obviously was standing there as well\nAnd is there interviewing these Dodger officials about you know getting to back to back World Series for the first time in forty years none of them mentioned Dave Roberts\nIt's interesting as soon as the reason I asked that as a start\nWas here's a guy who's like you said got him to the series\nIt does get into your head that you don't have a contract no matter what anybody says and the other question the second question was going to ask was how much of the decisions that we're seeing made or day Roberts and how many are coming in from Friedman or ... his boss where are his saber metrics guys and they get sent down he\nDoesn't but the public thinks while Robert sent this guy in Robert tomato pitching decision we're coming from do we know\nWell we do know this\nThat David Roberts who by the way makes one million dollars which sounds like a lot of money for all of us but to put that in perspective he gets paid the same as Andy Green the Padres manager who is got to his team to three consecutive Ninety last season so he's making the same amount of money part of the reason David Roberts\nGot the job is that have agreed that he would play the game of the saber metrics in other words here's this script followed the ... we see him with his flip cards in certain situation right what is it that management wants me to do in that situation but here's the problem and I\nWas talking to mark Martinez he's the baseball coach at San Diego state he's

won't allow political violence\nLet me see us all to anything I can to stop it now and the ... the FBI he applauded the department of justice et cetera but all the different agencies and he said America must unify and I ask you eight hundred to two to five to two\nWhen they finally describe what went on hearing again we don't know if this is the sole suspect we don't know if he's an accomplished we don't we don't know his motives um uh we\nDid see that the truck appears to be plastered boy how many stickers you point out what if I had that many stickers on a vehicle isn't it
