dinosaurs\n\nOr hey is it six nine new injury here the national key word and testing nine five one\nGuns in dollars\nThere's\nBeen bumps and by the pickup\nI mean the city has Paul corrects really really and the counting is going to have who are on oversight for all the ... and by the way this thing has no sunset clause\nSo theoretically if they point out the problem and they fixed it you can you're going to keep paying even after they structure because there is no ending to this and that's how they write into just open ended and I guess they hope that you don't know how to read or that you don't know how to ask a question\nBut there is no real plan if anybody can tell me what that plan is I'd love to know I don't see any projects propose that are specific\nI don't see any timelines for how they're going to execute and what the benchmarks are um by the way this is high speed rail its best okay they just keep going and they just keep spending money and I don't see and then they just keep moving any kind of fake benchmarks down so if\nYou don't have any measurable goal how do you know when you've achieved that goal if you didn't set it and you didn't tell us what was going to accomplish but it's not even clear\nYou're going to pay which each owners and have to pay 'cause you know they're going to do they're going to use aerial satellite photography\nTo decide how much your roof how many square for your roof is your ... your driveway any concrete do you have the gym permeable that doesn't absorb water okay what runs off\nSo they're going to do it from the sky and then you're going to get a bill and then how are you going to contest that bill do you have to hire somebody to prove to them that the square footage that they said we're and by way how's that going to go wrong that that could not be a problem I think they're going to do it from the air and decide on uh how\nThen you're going to fight it and how often do you have to come back and prove to them that they're wrong and what if I have done something last year\nOr to make the runoff better I took him like how do I is it retroactive kind of who they don't answer questions they just say write us a check please just write us attract and we keep taking a bigger and bigger hit and man\nI'll pay for stuff if it's valid I'll pay for stuff if you tell me what is going to pay for stuff if you show me that there's transparency and they're experts who knows what they're doing but to just hand keep spending more money over to politicians\nWho claim they're going to do something and have no ability to do it is totally insane as a matter of fact there's also a a couple of lawsuits out there Glenn Dora would be required to shell out two hundred and thirty three million dollars over Twenty years\nFor about eleven point seven million a year or so they sued and they said wait a minute and there's something with some other municipalities\nThat this is wrong that uh the cost of the city and also the media is suing to\nOr if they win their lawsuit about compliance and they're saying the compliance was impossible because of the cause and because of these very things I don't know what we're paying into I don't know what the end result is going to be I don't know how we quantify this if they win the lawsuit we're already signed on to send checks\nTo the government for this what do we do for the counting for this then what do you do then you're up the creek without a paddle so there's too many moving parts on this but the big point is\nThey think were fools they just think we're idiots ... according to supervise are going to two point five\nCent tax to ... percent tax for every square foot of land shutting water and that's the end permeable areas like your roof your sidewalk et cetera and if it's going to raise supposedly three hundred million dollars a year and continue to raise three hundred million dollars a year so if you want to give them three hundred million dollars a year but you don't care that they can answer the hard questions like\nWhat are the projects how you're going to do it when's it gonna end who's going to have oversight which are really reasonable questions when you ask us for money repeatedly and I think we've got to start holding their feet to the fire but again they write these things in such a language that they scared though the lights on people\nAnd they figure we're not going to have any water and I'm going to feel guilty so what the heck is is two and a half cents per square foot you know how much that's going to be on your house you know how much that it has any idea\nSo I Know they probably have a site where they give you some kind of a calculation but what if it's off how do you fight it how much is going to cost a fighter who do you fight with and when is the end they for this thing what's it going to accomplish Rick in about ... you in for the uh the string mortar attacks good idea\nEight or God Bless you for setting up the way you did this is that the definition of insanity ticketing politicians money and expecting at different outcomes\nAnd they don't they don't tell you what they're they're they they tell you enough but they're not specific how are you not specific\nWell because they're not businessmen politicians you ask a businessman had to raise money he says you know what I got to come up with a product or service and manage my coffee in a good way\nTo show some kind of profit or at least break even for me to get money those dishes don't need to do that how politicians get money they tax you that's all they have no clue how to run the government which is basically running a business they haven't a clue\nAnd this is what you get and unfortunately you asking people are going to keep doing is they keep doing it my wife and I after after elections you know ... shake our heads legal that people understand what they're doing in most cases they do\nAnd you know it's a shame work some cases their right to be asking for money in some cases it's a prudent probably smart thing to do but they cry wolf so often\nAnd they don't do due diligence they don't do the least is expected of them if they're asking for money because they have a history of not having to\nDo vote 'em again I go back to the to de ... de W ... trust that we were not allowed to know it's our money and we weren't allowed to know what's in them and and and every year we give\nMoney from the general onto the GW pie and you go okay that's the backdoor tax I mean we just we're sheep you go okay All right just take more money and then you complain and you say look the services aren't they are well guess what would this storm order tax\nYeah we have dropped out here we have severe whether you believe in climate change yeah it's going to get tougher we need more water\nCan you captured and clean it great show me how you're going to do it show me how you're going to figure out the real dollar value to that and the end date to that and some benchmarks that you have to hit the continuing than none of that it's not even one oh one for business it's the dumbest thing I've ever read and I really did due diligence dug down\nAnd ... there there is a no no sunset clause or dust critic tax so it's in perpetuity so if their problem is addressed\nThe tax remains does this make sense anybody\nWell Peter I I I go back to my late ... thank you for your due diligence which fortunately most voters don't do but like I say if it was a private company they came to you every two years or every four years and said you know what we're broke we need more money what would you do your\nOnly the only I'm only dumb like that when it comes to my children who keep saying I'm going to say what's your plan and they leave their money and by the way that doesn't work out so well either because they don't have a plan\nOr in in their ... or is it close to home well thank you for\nFor the for noticing and I hope a lot of people are hurting because I don't want to just rant and rave if it's not warranted\nBut this is ... agrees it's horrible it's a stupid thing that they say give us all this money and it's billions of dollars billions and a lot of his borrowed money so then you're paying constantly constantly you're paying down the money your kids don't have it a shot at it and really what they need to do is do pension reform\nAnd look at the ... the bloating of the uh you know the the\nThe um the administration in in Sacramento and plans and transparency but they won't they won't because that takes [noise] being responsible you just want to write it in a way that's confusing and often scary enough that people go\nOh storm would attacks we do need more water I'm just gonna sign on not knowing that there is NO PLAN and that even most of the money they don't have to target for this so they cover their but well thank you ... or ... I Hope I'm Glad you heard it and Tom and I'm Out in the morning\nA theater hey you know I I don't know if you've noticed some of the commercials now for prop six\nYou know it's just a pure scare tactics you know all the rules are going to fall apart bridges are going to fall and you know prior to January when the new gas tax and the registration fees went up what are we paying so I Know we're paying we're still paying higher gas tax or that we're still paying registration what were they use that money for\nWhat they want to increase all these these these costs and the thing is the biggest thing is that ... doesn't pass it's just going to give the uh the tax or the legislation the ability to just raised taxes willy nilly without any uh\nAny regard for us because you know we've all we all are fighting back it up without willing you know if that doesn't pass though people are going to be cut tires that you know what we thought we lost ... there's no point\nIn ... and also as Tom if they keep losing and ... maybe maybe at some point they go you know what\nI guess people need some fiscal accountability for us to put something else up for a vote that maybe we do need to show them where these taxes going you know one of the reports showed that only twenty percent of the existing gifts like funds go to road\nThat's right so they encounter ... and a half a million bucks on staffing I don't know the breakdown they're just saying give us more so we give you more in three years the roads are exactly the same and we've accomplished what you and I have less money\nFor Roger further because they can't afford to live in the city who're compromise because they can't afford the rents here we're driving for the hardest so people with less money or hit the hardest and somehow they just expect this to continue and it can't continue it said that and you know what\nI wrote a song to make my point are you ready for this please everybody I ...

the new village people the cowboy the rapper in any way so they were there and\nWas it good optics does it change anything does it help them with midterms I mean the president's pretty calculated about how to drive votes and he stays on point what was the net gain a net loss of him visiting the White House it reminded me of Nixon\nAnd Elvis Elvis went there because he wanted to be I think he wanted to be um at the age and get a badge remember\nAnd he I think he could convince Nixon that he knew every drug because they were all in his body when he died he seeking all doing on the road will die lauded I remember the list when the corner was reading about I've never heard of him for those drugs\nI'm so tiny and when he was doing I mean my take on this again you can weigh in eight hundred

suggested that a majority of Americans disapproved of the confirmation of cabinet and that among women at this was\nEven more sharp the disapproval rates so you know on the whole nationally there are indications that cabin as deeply unpopular and that the actions of the Senate were deeply unpopular but I think the real nuance here comes first\nIn the swing states ... states where there are ... Senate elections that are contested were Democrats are trying to defend their seats and in those states I think the polling was heavily in favor of cabinet rather than against them as places like Wisconsin North Dakota Missouri set of red leaning conservative states that have those blue senators\nAnd the other thing to know is that in general\nPeople tend to view the cabin are sharing along with their tribe the red tribe will view in favor of cabin on the blue tribal view and flavor of Dr Christie and Bob before and that doesn't necessarily translate to who is actually going to show up in November and and pull those buttons and\nPull those those handled in favor of one candidate or another so\nThe you know it could go either way I think those rationales really both make a lot of

several years talking to people about\nHow they think about how the country is doing and what he found was overwhelmingly people tend to be optimistic about their communities about what's happening locally they see a way to make change and overwhelmingly people tend to find those national politics to be alienating frustrating\nTotally don't trust the institutions that guide national politics and I think we see a little bit of that contrast when people are thinking about their guy in Congress for Congress as a whole\nA good point you brought a right to have to ... was it because it's too big

but\nBeyond the way the identities of the two parties have been solidified as just coming\nFrom radically opposite tribes people who can't even understand\nThe world view as somebody who identifies
