mean by user generated by people love setting in those photos which is great\nYeah exactly no they they're excited and what we've seen a lot of people who you know ask us you know based on a post oh where can I get that and then they'll buy it and then they'll share it after they've bought it which is really satisfying\nWonderful you know it's like you've got a whole group of friends out there now how many followers this young with Louis Howe now on Instagram\nUm you know collectively with all their channels I Believe it's like twenty six thousand something like that\nVery nice very nice a lot of engagement which is great in lots of ... let's let's switch now to another subject or we do the uh uh a messaging for first five California\nAnd that's a state wide effort that's paid for through tobacco taxes that was developed in Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand the initiative\nAnd as a result of that campaign we've developed a out of the brain science has told us how important the first three years are to the development of the brain first five years in total\nBut in those but there's there's three years there's so much development that's occurring and it's truly stimulated by talking reading and singing children's hearing the words of their parents and the uh holding and cuddling actually the people engage in when they're reading to their kids to play with them and talking to them\nAnd in this day and age and technology people put up the phone and talk you know look on the phone and go to Andrew cramped pinch setter right at the center of this is Sara Lee spending as much time with their kids\nShould we try to get the ... and we've been using social media for first five to do that as well\nUm can you give me some examples I Know we're still strong on Facebook there and his show absolutely\nYeah you know I Will say that you know that user generated comments I made earlier it it really holds true here too for first five California\nYou know a lot of people are posting their content with hashtags talk read saying and when we read post that content with their permission we noticed that that tends to trigger the most engagement because it's real parents doing things that\nAre real I mean you know really authentic activities with their children when we post you know a picture of a child with his grandmother smuggled up on the couch reading a book that gets a lot of response and it also triggered more response more photos via comment\nFrom other users I Love it to us is such a big\nWin are there any kind of unusual or on pictures that you've got that you feel are at a different that are good at Apple's\nYou know I we get all kinds of things that I remember one time we got oppose from a mother who sends a photo of um [noise]\nIt was basically a flower pot with three rocks in it and the rocks\nWe're in kid kid writing it said talk read things so her little daughter\nHad taken these rocks that had written and talk read singing it and put it in a flower pot oh adorable but strange thing but it just goes to show now that our message is definitely being heard not just by parents but by kids with our catchy song you know talk read saying I mean people are really\nUh you know hearing it and taking action\nAbsolutely you know we just can't you talked about sixty parents up and down the state in focus groups and people could actually sing the song which was amazing and and and they um they talked about their children getting up in front of the television and dancing to it\nOr they loved it I it was great to hear that and we know that are based on a UCLA study across the state eighty seven percent of the parents you know the song and the campaign\nI'm not surprised on your ... and I don't want to end it\nRight just wonderful with the birds ... talking and cigna now we also we also pay some influence or to help us develop non chance of the ... for one and it talked\nA little bit about that ... what that entails 'cause that was kind\nOf course well for the ... the family so in case in case the listeners aren't sure who they are so they're one of the top YouTube water families they have over Fifteen million come by subscribers while they have over two billion\nSo we're talking big time you're these are these are big big YouTube celebrities um [noise] so we worked with them\nYou know uh about a year or so ago to do campaign they wanted to leverage of course there you know their celebrity and try to infuse the importance of talk read saying in into their content that challenge with type ... thing here is we're not necessarily selling anything that's tangible we're trying to\n... more of these ... here at home with your kids and when you're out rapidly\nSo how can we do that because more you know most influential programs tend to be with some kind of tangible things so we actually work with them and had them bring up old baby videos from you know they have two kids a boy and a girl and they had all these baby videos of them like\nYou know reading and singing together so they basically did like a showcase peace where it was going back\nIn time and sharing with their followers all these unseen videos all this unseen footage of them talking reading and singing and really leading up to how that helped you know what the kids you know success today\nSo it made for a really compelling and interesting story their viewers were engaged\nNever a hundred thousand dollars right on yeah hundreds of thousands of people who visit videos\nOh it was four point six million of use\nLight light yet except\nI remember that day that it launched we had a huge spike in traffic which showed that people not only watch the video but also clicked on our link which was provided and in the you know and the comments section of the Youtube videos\nSo it really took an action I check it out and they went to the website and sign up for point five point nine million or ... today that was pretty impressive and ... yeah and\nA relatively modest investment so we're very very place that we've been able to get so many families engaged in the region we use influence or is this particular case we use up Mario Lopez we've had you message as\nA A R Halley on Univision we've used a lot of individuals across the state who are celebrities but what is real people people feel it authentically are sharing the measures it goes a step further and convince people to try and do the behavior\nExactly you know one of one of the ones that we also works with what do say candy she is actually a beauty blogger which doesn't sound like it would make sense but a lot of our target does does consumer content so that was another way to effectively reach them and we did some some sponsored content with her as well\nYou know what is that what people should understand there are ways when we do this kind of industry grabbed you push the message out by using the influence or you can actually pay to get it pushed down even further sponsored it and and that's what we do as as part of the game plan in the marketing efforts Frasier communications\nSo we're really a company that understands how to use social media effectively just straight in your brand how to generate leads how to make the connection for sales as we do for Jonathan Lewis this huge sleep Melissa\nBut also people do engage in behavior change and change their behavior and sustain it over time which is so important mhm well thank you unless you know I'm going to close with a quick question about how do you measure the impact of social media\n[noise] you know there's a lot of different ways we can we can look at that um we call him KP I Wonder if that would be a you know overall website traffic you know is there an uptick in traffic uh you know following an influence or activity\nSocial media growth is another one I'm not just talking about numbers but also engagement\nConversation and also inquiries for products so sometimes you'll notice an uptick in direct messages on Instagram private messages on Facebook or overall post comments that you know these are all areas that we've seen growth and across across the board\nPerfect are big enough errors\nYeah and for conversations that also includes you know other users you know posting content like for for five you know here's here's what I'm doing for talk read things so really showing you know that they're all being actively involved\n... in the conversation and and the actual behavior\nWell thank you this has been a great conversation with Melissa Miller who's the social media strategist Frasier communications and she shared with us the value of social media today and the importance of working with him so insurers hand selected and crafting those relationships thank you for spending time with us on the decider as\nWith chips insights and inspiring stories you could hear our podcast anytime on our website at the decider dot com we'll be back next week here on the designers with Renee Frasier [noise]\nThis show furnished bi racial communication\nFor three years the national key word and tested nine five eight or\nOne thousand dollars\nJust to\nLong horn cumulus station\nWhen I was caught\nOn this vote the hours were fifty the news or forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nAnd so sometimes they're not seeking more because that is getting fulfilled for them\nWhen then their partner not that they can't have skin to skin contact with their children but often um in terms of traditional gender roles there's not as much you know that a physical contact and ... and being produced so they're kind of left out to dry [laughter] yeah\nWell it's so interesting you know I when I think about working with couples who are starting a family inevitably we talk about how do you want to cure right situation so that you're both feeling supported how do you talk to your partner about your fears about your needs and so often I think both men and women\nFall prey to this idea that they have to be strong for their partner and they have to protect their partner from understanding what's going through their minds when in fact holding that back is what creates distance\nRight because our minds and make up what we don't know what we make up is usually far worse\nRight and when we can show up for our partners and really mean into them and take the risk that they can hear us without judgment we're creating a space for there to be far more intimacy in connection\nAnd we can live a long time on that even when we're sleep deprived and have spit up on us in our changing diapers all day long and our sleep and we can\nOnto the rock that is that foundation that's been created with strong communication\nRight I think you know when also there is a break in the physical intimacy or shift and the physical intimacy it's a great time to really lean in to increase the emotional intimacy mhm so that you're not just feeling disconnected\nAbsolutely and also it's important to remember that physical intimacy doesn't need to always be sex right right right you can hold hands you can give back rubs flip bribes you can give hugs\nThere's a lot of ways to be affectionate that if you're afraid to have sex or it's not safe for the pregnancy for whatever reason physical intimacy is really key and cultivating\nThat connection and seeing really true to what he started\nRight and just like with babies the skin to skin contact even just cuddling with partner and producer for a lot of oxytocin that feeling of kind of blissful this\nAnd for those who don't know oxytocin is a really interesting chemical produced in the brain that is that chemical responsible for all of our\nBonding needs and bonding satiation so we're going to have some experts on it a little bit and they can talk more about it but oxytocin gets released whenever there's physical touch and from others that starts in utero and also as part of what allows for the birth to happen and for breastfeeding to happen because it it kicks up a lot of\nFeel good and love for the object of\nAre loud and well a sense of wellbeing and safety mhm\nYeah so ... what are some of the things that you like to tell me moms as they're getting treatment and thinking about how to transition into this next step in stage in\nTheir life well it really depends on what their issues are but I think overall just having an open mind and recognizing that everybody's experience is different so I think one of those things new moms get bombarded by is advice from other people that are worn that are ... and that can be overwhelming and confusing\nBut also just to have patience and so much self compassion um what their body is doing as a miracle and everybody's body responds differently and it is both extremely reporting and there's also a lot of challenges that they will face yes\nYes I usually say those things and also everything you thought you could control thrown out the window because who wants to favor becomes you're going to have to learn how to get flexible and adjust your schedule\nAnd get used to the fact that there's a lot that you don't know you don't know and you only will get that information as your baby shows up and you get to know your baby and then it's about creating a system that works for your new family and also I think it can be really challenging for a lot of women who are having a baby for the first time or even a second or third time\nTo negotiate what it means to be a parent especially if their relationship they had with one of their parents has been a strange I'm slowly and especially if that relationship is with their mother\nSo often times people will come in and show or progression in terms of their progress in treatment and start saying things like well I have to let my mom in the in the delivery room or I have to let someone says mom in the waiting room and I have to do this and I have to do that\nAnd I think it's important to really slow down and remember that you weren't going to be a parent you get to set the pace and set the boundaries for what is allowed with your family and everyone else might have a lot of feelings about that and they're entitled to those feelings but you are also entitled to set the boundaries yeah household early\nAnd they think it's really important that um if people are struggling with our own um family of origin issues that are being kicked up which often happens when we have children it's important to get support in whatever form that may be therapy a group even a mommy and negro mhm\nYes absolutely well we're going to take a quick break but when we come back more

and together where the co founders of train therapy group psychotherapy practice face in Brentwood in Los Angeles\nIf you're just tuning in today we're talking about sex after childbirth with returning guest Dr Danny macadam the founder of modernist Attica in Santa Monica and writer Howard\nThe founder of the women's clinic LA so we were talking a little bit about the changes to women's bodies after they are pregnant and have a baby and I'm Wondering about what are some of the things that women talk to you both about in terms of liking the changes that have happened after their babies have\nRarely will like with her with her roses are bigger I go uh most of the time but there's not many changes do they look after pregnancy is all about trying to get back to the pretty baby body ...\nAgreed yeah well I hear a lot of women talk about how they like the way they feel curvy or are they like the way they feel soft or anything like feeling like they're more feminine and that way but that usually doesn't last very long can you have to be [laughter]\nIn my\nLife that my vision is once you get back to the hard vital investor have therefore maybe on the wrong side of the equation when we are no\nLegs event yeah layer right\nI have a friend who was I'm a bit under weight and so when she after she had a baby she was really enjoying that she had larger brass and also her but was a bit for and she really enjoyed that but she's also not because she's always been under way she's not someone who's you know very focused on being\nSaid right now she's the exception though right or a library that less than half [laughter]\nSo I Wonder about specifically if both of you can talk about how sexual arousal and the beat our impacted during pregnancy postpartum and then maybe even up to a year after I Wonder what your experiences that well\nIn in most patients uh they are telling us that it's less sensitive right after I ... some patients\nWill tell you that it's more sensitive because of the blood flow into the area which actually send typically make than than the ... into the the China will give him more sensitivity but some patients are saying that they just don't maybe it's because it's psychologically a you know it was part of depression a lack of filed a veto\nAnd the harm on all change is well the fact that I'm more than a physical changes mhm but typically it's actually supposed to be a better\nAnd um because it's not them certainly do things to stimulate and I think that today and it was going to talk about his procedure and that we do it with one I'll establish their laser that we go around and declare tourists to stimulate the tourists and it's very effective and that lasts about a year oh wow so that works really well\nI have a question about during pregnancy how's the libido affected for women at least during pregnancy due to hormonal changes actually better during\nPregnancy because of their work I'm On a surge you have a lot of estrogen during pregnancy and the surgeon estrogen and for just run makes women are very happy\nThat true through each trimester\nOr it's it's actually better toward the end okay I guess you have those search right before the baby is ready to take a lot but it's also affected by the male perspective that they're free to have sex and the third trimester said the lack of a sexual activities sometimes that also plays them all\nRight I had a friend who would say she was so uncomfortable you know in the last month or so maybe lost too much so uncomfortable she did not want to have sex however her husband wasn't trying anymore and she was\nSaying I'm so mad at least try but you don't want you to I Know well I can say no but I Want them to actually she wanted to film wanted you know when you make sense\nTo us selling therefore that that the intimacy yeah as far as the ... the ... you know can substituted yeah you're getting definitely use other modalities yeah\nCertainly will ultimately it's the ultimate catch twenty two and women are in the first trimester will not be more than a certain you know that morning sickness and body is changing the men you because the women pretty much look exactly the same in the first trimester are still very worn it as a woman gets more fragment she says there's more estrogen there's uber warning\nAnd the guys are like go away you're pregnant or weird weird though my advice to a guy\nWho have sex with her pregnant ... they will be happier and you will be out [laughter]\nGot it after the basis for it you don't\nGet out of the baby was born when the guy wants to have\nSex she can't you know for physical reasons and for you know hormonal reasons so you got to get it where you can go\nAffecting dads\nThat's too funny so sensation changes though after childbirth that's really interesting can you say a little bit more about what's happening at the sensation changes what was the sensation\nRight afterwards because of the physical changes and if you have a ... if you have scarring I'm really afraid to even touch and it's super sensitive ... so it does play the role insensitivity as far as having sex\nAnd that sense David in that area I don't think that makes a huge difference right after I think that the the issue is so a little bit later on\nRight I mean it's just it's painful and all you do it you're uterus as the size of an orange right and then it becomes a sizable watermelon oh are you know and then did strings back towns of ... you're sharing through a lot of nerves and\nMussels when you do an advantage and will deliveries especially they're so traumatic because\nYou will tear through nerves you will tear through to issue and you know you will get you to run out and they sometimes will just means the universe does not want to shrink back down to a home to\nDo they have to give you more oxytocin to kind of help and uterine massage the kind of help shrink it down that is a massive foreman will change and a massive physical change so I'm sensation sometimes are more sensitive but not in a good way for I go right\nThat makes sense about how long would you say those kinds of sensational changes last before women can start to feel like they're back to themselves\nFor ever ever I mean you're not really the same wants to have a baby I mean that's ... ... in your experience\nIt is true it will never be exactly the same but for most women uh I Would say that the changes are they can live with that can uh experienced the same pleasure and the same experience as before I Would say at least a year\nIn terms of sensation are there any sensation changes that the man experiences and intercourse after ...\nOther than the obvious [laughter] well you know an enemy changes yeah ...\nYou know the to use that analogy that may or may not fit or you know it's like getting a different size glove right now doesn't have the same you know but for the most part for men I mean we're we're simple ... if you know you give us a glove were happy or not it's the same we had before\nAnd with a cassette player which works wonderfully and then it cat\nWell then you've got a problem and the radio system itself then if you can't hear the cassette because that's by passing I mean a radio antenna has nothing to do with that so you got a problem in the radio or in the connections there itself may be in the speaker may have bad speakers\nSpeakers sounded wonderful\nWell sometimes yes they condemn Robert work\nBecause she had speakers into doors I thinking that model of speakers on the dash\nAnd I would take it out and ads Allen Allen heads and they will make just telling me talk to me and they will make the they'll check it out right away and tell you exactly this\nWonderful I'll do that one might question on like eighty four Toyota sound like a I have a real we're tale I break like that that goes on but it's not very bright what what it's you know I have changed the ...\nGot a bad ground just go to bed ground maybe corrosion and tobacco the where the Philip ... which is the ball goes into it's usually a bad ground which causes it or not as bright\nAs usual oh that all in after several repair\nOh good I liked it until we care [laughter]\nThanks for your call you have a great day my dear\nHe's made my day you may as well thanks\nSo much okay and they sometimes go to speak to marry the school and\nUh uh uh\nOkay go to Ron Ron welcome\nTo launder man how you doing I'm doing well my friend or I haven't heard a joke in a while\nOh God I had a busy show this morning let's say a joke let me see if I go to any left here uh I think I've used is one before let me know that when a word as a snowman keep his money\nOh man that's a good one way or that in the snow bank\n[laughter] that I that that's that's good okay or ...\nAnd ... my daughter has a two thousand eleven signing\nOn tc it's a cool little car very clean well kept and her\nHer steering locks up and where what what it was so we called we had a a gentleman come by and take a look at it at the house and he said while it's either the battery are your Alternator and he he ... he didn't know what it was he was going to come back\nWell wait a minute oh whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on the steering\nWheel locks up and then he's talking about battery and yes\nIs it why would he talked about ... electric staring\nThat that's why I don't understand and so we've put a new battery in the car and if it came back to work was normal for about a month\nNow happened again I don't sound it fights\nSo we have we have as a as we're going to have a total home next this this coming Monday\nAs hard as clear\nYes you can be Sterritt\nAre you sure to electric power steering or hydraulic power staring\nAt a good question\nWell if I drive I got a tendency to think it may be hydraulic but I'm just trying to think of to electric power steering as they have the lecture motor that drives the powers to him but if as hydraulic battery and Alternator has nothing to do with that whole day that's what's got me confused here well\nMy my neighbor who's at my cat you know on the side he he he he took that he does the alternate or to a shop and had a test that you said there's nothing wrong with the alternate\nAlternate it has nothing to do with just staring at England if there was bad\nIt unless the battery went completely dead that the ... alternated silly I you're getting some bad information somewhere I'm not the greatest guy in the world but I'm a perfect that has nothing to do with it and maybe lost electricity altogether electric power steering is one thing but it's not draw like the battery alternate as ... to do with it they're\nOkay nothing whatsoever so you get some funny information somewhere\nI don't I've never heard of that and then this was electric staring if your battery ... wouldn't start it wouldn't start would move ... know something's fishy there you must have hydraulic I don't know why he would say\nTo do that like if I\nIf I if I put in a bind new battery car it came back to like it was like brand new again and then about a month later I guess it just stopped again and the battery needed he jumped\nOff the battery was dead again yes\nBut the batter was completely dead then that would be electric staring the batteries completely dead but then you get something just draining the batter she\nLeaves leaving like Sean glove compartment light something is being left on to run when when does it go dead them\nGetting do when you're driving down the road it goes bad\nBoy that isn't that what your dry when just when you come to stop I mean then you start to car off you go go gears days to come back in the car than it doesn't want to start\nNothing it's just dead a jumpstart it\nI have a job they are starting to light up and then the state of all comes back at this last time this general did not want to come back to where you can really trying to go to just like really\nReally you've got some kind of electric connection if it all the NATO charging properly so you took to all they had done it should be done on the car tested with a B R machine\nMaybe arm machine you can check the ... the charging system and check the battery draw\nYou can check all of these things he's taken parts all one might want I don't know why the battery would go dead just cutting it off unless you had a bad connection somewhere or to charging system is working good weather Scott electrical problem we're not\nMaking contact to recharge the batteries doing everything backwards\nYou know just in a battery and it just a bit of bad rented I mean you need to find out whether the alternate or is actually charging the battery deserve to saying I've been taking to have it all day to chart maybe something in the wiring is not letting the electricity go from the all the native to the battery\nBut I don't understand why is charging it should be the old at the light on the dash should be on the altar charging light\nMhm some Fisher here that need to need to have somebody really knows what they're doing to check this out this not brain surgery is just as soon as next problems here\nAll to me that's what I'll do that\nAll right thanks Ron I appreciate that and you do the same Bye bye\nBye bye now and let's go and speak to a gym gym in Northridge welcome to the program\nA modem in to talk to you recently I'm the fellow with the ah the eight Nineteen eighty three Mustang and I'm Out of town and quite a bit so it it suffers until I get back and I'm at spoken to you about the underlying overheating problem which had been diagnosed as he see em but this week my mechanic I had a\n... like trying to control the ... the computer what would that overheating let's not turning on the electric fans\nYeah I'll have to have everybody check that out but I got a new problem this week 'cause I had a\nMassive leak while I was gone and leaking what a hemorrhage and it turned out to be a transmission fluid mechanics\nSent me over to Leon transmission and now it needs a whole re ceiling job transmission re ceiling job so I as the largest job I've had to have on this and I'm but I'm just wondering what your whole philosophy would be I think you've touched on it earlier what is it time to pack it in or is this a\nWhile just for ... you know a few hundred dollars to to refill the transmission how many miles on this vehicle\nUh two hundred and forth and then you need to rebuild the transmission if you're gonna take it out to receive that you might as well do a transmission\nOkay we rebuild on it and it's like a difference\nOf eight hundred and eighty versus sixteen hundred now for the rebuilt transmission\nThat's pretty reasonable sixteen hundred dollars for rebuilt transmission okay but the cars weren't there where are you going back carpet sixteen hundred dollars have been good condition list I mean everybody ... you'd be will and probably to go on spent four thousand ten thousand about another car\nThat's true yeah and I spent six day that I mean you know it's an eighty three car if you're low mileage\nAnd they like to a race race that model isn't it if I if I did it for granted tally family race race these this maybe the body they like a\nMonth to bottom but now it's a nice car for sixteen hundred dollars you need a car if you don't need a car is one thing but if you need a car for sixteen hundred dollars and drive it another two hundred thousand miles let's say that's ... that's the cheapest vehicle you ever going to buy\nYou know I mean I'd like to keep it maybe you need a newer car just to get around\nThat may be but I mean if you don't need another car you could certainly uh just fix that when he fixes yeah keep fixing a gym and thanks so much for your call I'm running out of time do you have a great day thank everybody for calling them think Jay Leno think everybody a\nThank you art I thank you ... it's been a busy busy show folks have a great week will do it again all next week all over again\nRemember keep smiling it's just a little curve that sets a lot of things straight have a great week everyone\nYou can grab a

Los Angeles Orange County\nAnd Kate's Kavanaugh has been sworn in as the newest justice on the Supreme Court Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine tells CNN state of the union at Kavanaugh's demeanor sometimes went too far during his hearing\nBut Dr Ford there it was the can of colored fizzy sugar water right in plain sight\nI mean that's an amazing prop that somebody's going to get paid for that somewhere along the line because I I don't think it was a much I I I think it was by design okay so on my Facebook page I simply posed a question and people were tearing into each other\nThe question was how do you know this is before of course the vote went through and he became the uh a Supreme Court judge\nBy a slim narrow margin but the question was how do you vote caffeine and sugar or barley and hops that set off a firestorm of comments I didn't mean for it to turn political I was just talking about the caffeine in the sugar in the can of coke that she sat on the table my opinion by design\nAnd the a discussion about love of barley and hops [laughter] tracking it it it uh it was more barley and hops a\nThe way they sort of one out but man oh man the caffeine and the sugar crowd wet for the juggler if it was nasty but it wasn't designed for that it's really a health oriented or a you know Facebook page\nBut I just I it was just an observation of you know call me strange\nBut when I saw that coke in there and they'll come on you're gotta be kidding me here\nI'd say ... that's how we're going to be talking about today we're going to be joined by special gas coming up and we're also going to be talking about diet drinks and I don't\nKnow if she had regular or you know sugar free or artificial sweeteners in that ...

medical school in Australia there they're talking about how diet drinks and artificial sweeteners increase the risk of diabetes\nJust the opposite of what you would think people\nGravitate to\nAnd they utilize these diet\nDrinks and artificial sweeteners because they think they can fool Mother Nature they think they can get away from the shoe gar and get over there to the artificial aspartame nutrasweet and the sugar loaf and all of that thing and okay I get my sweetness and eat it and drink a Jew\nAnd yet when you go into the supermarket next time take a look see if I'm telling you something that's for sure for real\nAnd that is look at in the car it's just it's kind of you know keep your eye out you're going to see people who are overweight and obese these are all the people who have all the diet drink and their cards they have three cans hanging out three cans it\nAnd they're the ones who are on the diet drinks now we know why well we know why because they don't work and they increase weight not decrease weight and they increase the risk of diabetes\nOr not decreased the risk and we'll talk about that a little bit later in the show or if we have time or else we're going to be talking about how hot dogs and burgers and this is going to break the hearts of many but hotdogs and burgers\nAccording to Harvard University as a researchers eating a dog a burger increases the risk of breast cancer\nIt's true\nNow I got to tell you I used to go to the ball games and I still do but I don't eat the hotdogs there anymore but I and I'm sure that this is related to a pretty substantial on a regular consumption of a burgers and dogs but most Americans eat\nProcessed foods they eat fast foods all the time it doesn't matter if it's alarming hotdogs bacon ham\nAnd

to try to help you in that regard to the doctor by march in show welcome back to the program\nAll right let's get to your phone calls and questions now an eight hundred to two fifty two twenty to one eight hundred to two to a K. A. B. C. after after I talk about these artificial sweeteners\nDrinking diet drinks or using artificial sweeteners could increase your risk of type two diabetes\nScientist found that just in two weeks of high intake of low calorie sweeteners these artificial sweeteners or no calories sweeteners was enough to significantly altered the makeup of\nThe bacteria in the guts this changes the way the body absorbs and regulates blood sugar\nThat's what the researchers are talking about some of these low calorie sweeteners and the diet Pepsi the Diet Coke all of that which are used by a lot of people are linked to changes in the gut bacteria\nAnd that could increase your risk of diabetes and people who have already they're overweight or they have diabetes are much much more prone to this if they're using a much more prone to getting worse if they're using these artificial sweeteners in diet drinks just the opposite of what you think\nSo if this is what you're using you need to switch over you have a lot of options you have the options of using a monk fruit which is zero calories as noble I C make index yet is very sweet about a hundred and fifty times sweeter than cane sugar\nYou've got Steve via as an option you've God's Iowa tall as an option anything get off these artificial sweeteners because when you mess with Mother Nature you fool Mother Nature get burned and in this case\nYou'll be burned in the case of diabetes type two diabetes All right back to the phones here is Cathy and west LA welcome to the doctor by margins show caddy hello\nOh hi Dr von thank you so much for your show um I have hide and they're really painful how'd you get rid of these\nWell how long they've been there a catty\nOkay ah about two days now\nOkay it's going to be difficult because it's hard to know because whatever it was that you set them into motion hyper you to carry it is an allergic reaction to something and that you you have a histamine reaction you have these these blood cells called ... and they go crazy when you expose yourself to something that your body didn't like in in\nIn this high it's sort of a protective mechanism your body is basically sending you an idiot\nIt's ... violated in some way and it's wanting to tell you on the surface the problem is internally though\nUsually it's something that you've consumed my first case of hives I was at the Dairy Queen and had this ... thing that was real red and had all kinds of artificial car is what I was a kid\nAt are all kinds of artificial coloring agent said it was just pure junk and I went home with a bunch of hives and my parents said okay so ah what did you eat or drink in the last six hours and finally we tend to down to the Dairy Queen a drink that I was so it can happen\nSo now you have it what do you do it well it's going to be difficult traced back and see if you can figure out when they first started and what you ate and keep a diary because you don't want to repeat that each and every time you want to learn from the experience that avoid it but\nMeanwhile what do you do well the best thing to do when you have hives as fast where you go on and water and lemon for a whole day\nThe second day you drink nothing but beet juice and carrot juice with a little salary and then you get these uses at the juice reason the health food stores and health grocery stores\nAnd what you're trying to do is you're trying to purge the toxic reaction from the body by taking away stress off the justice system so a day of nothing but water and lemon and a day of carrot juice a beet juice and maybe some salaries just whatever that'll clear it up and you'll lose about uh six pounds in the process which is good\nYou can also use things to a as naturally antihistamines like an ac ... which is a supplement in getting any health food stores and sulfur containing amino acid\nYou can use that are called net ... metal works really well for hide as does a type of flavor annoyed vitamin C. called ... these are all available to health food stores they're phenomenal at helping to get rid of\nOr hastened the healing process with a hive reaction which is an allergic reaction and

cancer that according to Harvard a Harvard study process it's all about the processed meats\nThe world cancer research fund recommends\nCutting out red meat altogether and I just read a study by the way\nThat taking extra vitamin D and getting your vitamin D levels up where they need to be cuts breast cancer risk by Ninety percent that's the latest\n... uh information about breast cancer and you should look it up just type in vitamin D breast cancer but are you if you eat hotdogs if you eat these hotdogs and burgers on a real regular basis that's when the risk goes up once in a while no big deal right\nAnd lastly guys out there who are struggling with prostate problems I had a guy calling in my ... a national radio show this morning which by the way IRS from six to nine AM you can listen

number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nLarry as we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush by us that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe he could take that into it into a ... expand on that with for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have Twenty years experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right and the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own they don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around to some education the problem is to very costly lesson why would you want to spend all that time energy and money\nWhen you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system\nAnd it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use the analogy hurt me use it before it's like driving a car\nIf anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go and drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the market you're going down to what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... coming educated and not trying to do it on their own is if there's a simple step by step process to system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody ... somebody has committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything that's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well that doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes as we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to me I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approached the markets in and and when I talked to people is very normally that did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income but the skill has to come first and\nIt's the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody a successful or not it's just like I I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane of across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation and we would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves to\nAbsolutely uh let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we found over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to

was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole the whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is not one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit of a multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you're saying in the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like well\nStarting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials because one of the biggest resolutions is what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt\nAnd this is something a lot of students come in and out of the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in\nThey don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days and five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities what\nI've talked to students about their biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where they're going to be able to make up that income and you know it's not a question anymore if it's when we're already starting to see\nLimousine and another vehicle it occurred just before two pm yesterday afternoon about forty five miles west of Albany in a tweet this morning the NTSB said they launched a goat team to the crash site\nThe Dodgers are in Atlanta tonight facing the Braves game three of the national league division series first pitch set for

two were not a hills and Seventy one degrees in downtown LA I'm John Myers KBC new [noise]\n\nYou're listening to power trading radio [laughter] welcome back if you're just shooting in us Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development happens structure it on I mean really shed some light on income when we we talked a lot about multiple streams of income we\nTalked about different types of income passive\nIncome active in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active income\nAnd and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow and I'm not income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment\nTalking to a little bit about the retirement accounts and so one of the things that maybe you miss out on that last segment as far as talking about more a more generating more income well don't worry we're going to be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation whether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nDon't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot via social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRave got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe you could address a few of those topics 'cause I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ... one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and to correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier in the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first thing we got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K.\nWhere you're only able to trade and mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss is set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people and senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes well right now you should be thinking about and especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira or four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover well this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever seen that index have been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nYeah and the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low opera opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the marks or going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for uh\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every pay the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nBathroom there are a speed through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that's ... that's the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK\nRight we just have to know that a Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right into the wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're in\nAging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes how do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there's it's OK let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area the happy classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your past this is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside her kid makes it so you just started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight and eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside well\nMost importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income\nEnables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou
