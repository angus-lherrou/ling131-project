{"content": "Willy nilly you know we all have friends or family members who say yeah I I wasn't at work yesterday 'cause I had the flu well I'm here to tell you that if you had the flu yesterday\nTruly the flu influenza virus\nYou didn't bounce back in a day it takes it's a very serious illness and\nDo I want to have the flu and I never made that mistake again because when I had it I knew it so I Know what you're saying\nAnd I bought when when people say you know it just because you sneeze rather sniffles or run a fever I have a sore throat doesn't mean you ... what\nAbout people saying the forty eight hour ...\n... not not no not influenza virus they may have a stomach bugs or or some other by there are so many viruses you know thousands of different viruses that can cause some of the same symptoms meaning you know body aches or fever sore throat\nA muscle pain fatigue those sorts of things but when you have full blown influenza which happens every year we have an outbreak it can be very search particularly for the very young and the very old\nAnd of the folks that um we're in this report Steve from last year about eighty eighty percent of them Ninety percent of them were over the age of sixty five and that is the group that is most at risk or elderly people and certainly than the very young\nMy question for you is if you if you get a flu shot you're not going to get the flu can you guarantee them\nAbsolutely no unfortunately not and I am a real solid about getting flu shots and people should but here's the problem in the best case scenario the flu vaccine is somewhere or in the range of forty to sixty\nPercent effective\nSome years it's very ineffective as low as twenty percent and the problem is that the researchers that people who make the vaccines\nAre working off of last year's information so we're fighting we're always fighting the last war if you will they are using last year's flu bug to create this year's vaccine and sometimes they're spot on and sometimes they're not it's a little bit of a crapshoot now that said\nIt's still you know if you can be protected you know somewhere around fifty or sixty percent\nThat's a pretty good start and this is where you really by you know sort of you have to think about the concept of herd immunity the reason we want many many people to be vaccinated is it the more people within the heard the population who are who are immune are vaccinated for anything whether it's influenza or\nOr measles or the less likely the people who haven't been vaccinated will end up getting sick\nThere is a point in a population where if you go below that level you don't have ... ... what is that more than\n... well it's a great question herd immunity requires a minimum of eighty to eighty five percent\nA immunization and frankly really if you when you get to about Ninety percent you're really what we talk about herd immunity so and the problem is in many pockets in this country because of this ridiculous fervor about ah\nYou know vaccines cause autism or vaccines are you know are bad for kids caused him into a deficiency problems or you know whatever the the the going\nThing as there are pockets including in California up and marine county for example where the immunization rates have fallen to below fifty percent that is scary stuff because that means that everybody is at risk and we want to to keep it to such that\nThe only people who aren't getting vaccinated are the people who might have a contract to ... people who are allergic to some some portion of the vaccine or who have it a a problem they're undergoing chemotherapy for example and therefore can't get a vaccine\nEverybody else really ought to get vaccinated it's the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your family because influenza is not a joke\nUm the people who get sick and hospitalized or God Forbid die from it generally um how they a complication like pneumonia that Jewish they said come I pneumonia is the most common a serious side effect\nAnd so you can imagine that in elderly people who might have other medical problems whether it's diabetes\nEase or asthma emphysema those sorts of things heart disease they don't necessarily bounce back from a loan yeah\nAll right so what you're saying is clearly get to get the shot forget everything else get the shot [noise] we got to go but Dr Kelly victory then very short and very strong thank you very much\nIn and wash your hands a lot [laughter] yeah wash your hands get care damage\nThe wash your hands a lot I never get the flu shot but she's very convincing\nWell because you are a lot of people who actually what I mean who think they will get it we'll talk about it we come back okay [noise]\nI'm In Southern California you know what
