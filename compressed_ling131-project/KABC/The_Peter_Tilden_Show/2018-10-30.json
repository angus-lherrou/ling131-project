more more people live and work downtown they need a better connection to area real stations will this isn't this isn't it\nUnique stuff that you can you can change 'em as the city's growing but this is not this this is a streetcar six hundred million dollars to regard\nPeter Tobin this is John ...\nGot married in a\n[laughter]\n[noise] we just got [laughter]\nWhere your best shot students who are in this time Peter killed it was really\n[laughter]\nIt wasn't for your chance to win a VIP invitation to our Halloween bash at the end Sean right in the little drive home of horrors lived for ...

more down the dining\n\nVoice hurt [noise]\nGet out and vote Shapiro encouraging you know [noise]\nEvery you need it straight talk and clear fact they thinking then Shapiro shelf life it takes thirty that's conservative commentators\nOr your listeners that you're\nGay ABC Los Angeles Orange County ... station [noise]\nSo that they say it's gonna create capacity for fourteen thousand three hundred more job in six thousand more apartments and condos\nSo yeah we need more development we need more housing we're meeting or affordable housing where that's coming from I don't know\nBut they figured that do build this housing around the expo line and it'll be more pedestrian friendly and they'll help residents run errands and get to work without getting behind the wheel and there again I show the whole they're they're digging at the site of our old building where\nWe have several hundred employees in there who would still take forever to exit onto last year and a good boulevard as well so you're going to undergo crawls when they finish that complex which I think is for twenty seven hundred people\nUm I think that it's going to back up the ten freeway going back ... right up to the ten freeway or the other thing is aside from the street from the broken sidewalks with this density plan happening\nWhat's the deal was response time for fire and medical emergencies remember we had that report that they had Mickey the fire response sounds right to know of of about a year ago and they were going to reject them and give us accurate numbers were when you have this kind of density stuff going on\nHow long has it taking now to get on the west side what are the response time for fire and medical emergencies um if if the streets or this clog and if the density\nIs not working if people aren't taking rail I'd like to see a study\nOnce they get some of these products done what percentage of those folks at seven thousand a month or twelve house for five months are walking out the door and taken metro or how many of them are two and three car families that it's just going to be in ... insanity so that's one one one thing is happening right now and fix the city is suing\nTo overturn the plan that would allow all this density building because the metros they are in these countries have reason to take it but this was one that crack me up\nThe headline LA wins one million dollars for the program to help homeless rent ready the granny flat in your backyard or actually more of a million bucks triple age that gave him a billion free but they're excited about a million dollars that they got in and listen to this\nLos Angeles has been selected as the winner of a million dollar Bloomberg Philanthropies us marriage challenge grant\nWill go toward a program encouraging homeowners\nTo build accessing developing in exchange for allowing a homeless resident to rent the unit for three years sounds okay I don't know exactly where they're going to put the milk because we already have billions homeless but congratulations Kelly we got so\nThe ADA you which is what the plan is called accessory dwelling unit ... whatever that is it's about what anybody wants to do this I'd love to hear from you if you're up\nFor doing it 'cause I got some questions they asked eight hundred to two to five to to do is designed to pair Homer owners where the homeless Angelino who is stable prepared to move into housing and ready to rebuild their lives which sounds good okay I get it\nFor homeowners it's a win win they're calling the city lowers your construction costs\nMatches you are the tenant who was determined to make their housing work and connect you with a case manager to ensure a seamless transition or said he's officer the grant could help residents build enough eighty use house hundreds hundreds of Angelenos not just remembered that\nThat we're looking to house hundreds of people and I don't want to be negative I Hope this is a good thing but I got some questions\nSo the deal is the ADA you program which is scheduled to launch in the spring\nWill include an online portal were property owners can access pre approved unit designs and other information and here the incentives to an offer for property owners value between ten and thirty thousand dollars going to give you a between ten and thirty grand\nTo build an ECU ... a tool to ensure a good fit between a renter and you as a property owner and the case management like I said for support along with they get reduced rent with the expectation by the third year the tenant would be able to pay the full rent them out the expectation\nThat by the third year they can pay the full right now so we were one of the nine cities the goddess of congratulations I'm I'm really proud of that and they're saying they're looking for land those who are compassionate and this is the leader of the program and it's called the innovation she's on the innovation delivery team\nSo remember they're going to give you a between ten and thirty grand so let's proceed with this\nSo they're working with architects and they have a project in highland park the first one is in highland park and it's going to be a model\nTo inform the city and you had to do it like if engineers Steve wants to put something in his backyard he can go to highland park Steve and look at this and say this is the model of what what I should do and you get tend to thirty grand to remember that okay\nThey also have a portal like this that and the ... type service were residents can find out more about what types of eighty use might be allowed on their property because there are laws of what you can do that\nTo some people have already are applying for this thing again we've got over at one point two billion dollars or to to use for this this this homeless program\nSo now you're going to build these aid using your in your backyard so there's restrictions and they'll need to be about ten feet from Maine residence and and the other state laws\nNow they're saying you can wave the parking thing 'cause you're with and a half half a mile of transit so there you go to save your thing already have maybe another car to and from your house which already has no parking\nSo they wave the parking thing um and you can either do it connected to your house or an attack from your house and I remember getting a thirty thousand bucks but here's the deal\nThe deal is I looked up what the average unit cause the average and it costs a hundred and fifty grand guess how much the unit is that they're building the first one that I said you can go look at to see as the model for this three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is what is it causing\nAnd you're not really getting thirty thousand cash what you're getting is maybe a tax break or they may cut your break up to thirty thousand dollars on all the forms you have to go through and dealing with the city so it's not really cashed in your pocket\nSo you basically have to come up with something like three hundred grand to build this thing and then as they\nDo with every other plan that they suggest you got to get insurance\nCan you imagine calling your strengths company and saying well I got a guy living behind me he's been kind of vetted\nBut he was on the street and he did have a drug problem in an alcohol problem and he's relapsed a couple of times and uh but I'm compassionate I really want to help what how do you ensure me for that what's my insurance for that and then a lot areas you have remember earthquake\nYou have um fire right you have floods so now you've got to get the answer I first got to get somebody is going to give me insurance then what you got to do is jump through all of the other hoops like\nWhat if I have a problem with this person wants to rent you vetted them and said there are a good fit can I pick them within a certain period of time\nAnd what happens at the end of the three years if they can't really pay the rent the increase rent do I get to a victim then or we go another three years after I've invested my three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the granny sweet behind and what if they relapse and it's terrific and they are doing drugs\nDo I called the ... years and say hey could you come over and help me deal with this they've done what they usually do\nThey throw this out they say it's a great idea let's do it and we'll figure out all the details later so once you have somebody living in your backyard and you've spent the three hundred thousand bucks or whatever you've spent\nThen you find out you can't fix or if there's a problem you have to go to mediate mediation and there's a problem with insurance plus most banks don't offer special special financing deals for eighty years so if you're going to borrow you may have to get a second mortgage and borrow against your house\nSo the thirty style with somebody living your backyard it sounds boy look the homeless issue is a tough issue\nIs this a smart plan is prudent and is ever gonna happen and what is it the one thing they don't mention is so they want this one million dollar grant what is the one million dollar grant going towards I still don't understand what that is and what are the metrics preparing that person\nWith you [laughter] your family and what if somebody breaks into your house in that house behind you and steal something and you're accused them of ... what do you do at that point it just sounds like they don't have much of this figure it out\nBut but they're ready to go and they're thrilled and announcing that they have this one million dollar program to help the homeless rent grainy flaps all you gotta do Stevie is lay out three hundred fifty grand build it jumped through the who skip the permanent get insurance do all of that\nAnd you know somebody living in your backyard that you're guaranteed is paired that that's a good fit but if it goes south what's in place to help you so ah interesting interesting that we're going that route interesting that they're still trying to do this granny flat thing I Wonder if it's worth I haven't seen any any of these pilot programs in any other cities\nSo I ... I looked up and saw where is this working well\nIt's not working anywhere at this point but our city has come up with this as as a plan so there you go we've got one point two billion and I don't I'm not sure that we've spent also the mayor announced the other day that he's got some money that was given to us by the state eighty one million was awarded to us\nHe may made it sound like he just got it came in July it wasn't something brand new I Am nervous about how they are handling the homeless issue with the lack of transparency and the lack of coordination between agencies at this point and that we are going to squander a lot of money\nAnd waste a lot of money that's unfortunately not going to help homeless\nNeed homeless um who need transition into housing a it's a big problem we got all this illness stuff ... and the road and a few in the ... you know businesses are upset\nCounty and then the corporation that when I donate sided dice\nAnd supportive and ... and ... minutes you'll ever seen a close you can go on to ... ...\nWhat the rules if you get ... get a lot about the time you were kicked out here the mayor or do you make it as as it is it's just a it's very very simple everybody to\nDo I got it All right All right I'll address that we come back from it but I don't mean to run but we got to go to the news but thank you for calling in I'm a simple solution you know the ... which is almost as your but thank you for that eight hundred to two to five to do take more of your calls right after the news [noise]\nSee news is live and local at ten thirty I'm Jeff will and the forest Bob's Boston mobster\nJames Whitey Bolger was found dead this morning and the federal prison cell in West Virginia\nNot according to federal officials the eighty nine year old ... recently arrived at the high security penitentiary according to the Boston Herald Bulger's spent sixteen years is one of the nation's most wanted fugitives before being captured in Santa Monica in two thousand eleven\nHe was convicted in twenty Thirteen of participating in a loving murders stretching from Massachusetts to Florida to Oklahoma\nPasadena police have arrested a thirty four year old Glendale man and connection with an ... suspected explosive device that was attached to a U Haul truck parked in Pasadena last night's discovery of a homemade bomb prompted the evacuation of several nearby buildings\nThe suspect the door bankers\nA was the subject of two outstanding drug war it's according to Pasadena pd he's now in custody\nAnd President Trump wants to end the constitutional right to citizenship for babies of non citizens in illegal immigrants who are born in the United states the president tells acts ios on HBO you wants to end the birthright citizenship which is included in the fourteenth amendment through an executive\nOrder now how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in hasn't may be and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas it's ridiculous\nThe move would spark a court fight over the president's authority to unilaterally change the constitution talk radio seven\nNinety eight a beefy sports lasers loss of Minnesota one twenty four one twenty last night's despite twenty nine points ten boards and stuff and assist from LeBron James New England\nBlasted buffalo twenty five to six on Monday Night football and that sports on seven Ninety ...

I Would just like to see the city's plan at this point for the billion to and how much they have spent\nAt this point and how the ... the benchmarks and what are the word of the different\nAn analyzing how they spent the money what the yield has been and what they have as benchmarks were first\nSecond or third year but I don't know that they knew that because I don't think they're even

anybody\nYou don't want to be a small landlord if you can avoid it the the way to the eviction statutes work it's really difficult there's lack of court resources you get dragged into it I'm an

first there's there's a there's going to be a plan and they're not answering any of the questions including the what do you think insurance is going to be\nNo yeah it was for those all those pragmatic

entered the existing solo family with actual so says it's problematic to do it and then in Port these people that the vast majority of them seem to have mental health or drug problems\nWell let's see walking the stats on that supposedly around thirty thirty percent I'm thirty five percent but that said you're assuming that the city vetting them right means the city will have liability in this but I guarantee the city will wash their hands on it and say oops we made a mistake\nWith your guy I didn't know he was a recidivist I didn't know he was going to do drugs again a big problem sorry\nYeah

we've got a good job with the three then they said we can't get 'em and anything because the sanctions Iran we got everything does know missiles we got our houses back we have the remains got me everything so now they said he met the new line is\nWhy\nThey're going to be fair to think of as having never going to be fair to think\nOf it I met [laughter] okay that's a new line I shouldn't have met so you know and if you go back to before I got here uh it looked like we were going to war a bad war with North Korea\nSo rude there have been people thing wasn't necessarily answered 'em but also he was asked about\nGoing to the rally in Pittsburgh uh when when the push for treating up and having to continue doing rally\nWhen you know I did a rally and ah I said in fact I was thinking about cancelling it I also did the young farmers and uh it was great to have that and then I had a rally afterwards and this and you know you make them too important to have you started canceling\nI remember ... I wanted to get the stock exchange open as soon as possible you did a great job and other things once you start doing that once you can so so you're doing a rally and rallies are meant to be funny\nRallies are meant to be everything and I said tone it down and then you sort of the group saying no don't tone it down don't tell me again [noise] so uh we had a great rally in Illinois for some great people and frankly um I think that's probably the way it should be he should go about your life you can't let these people\nDisrupt any more than they already have which is disgraceful what he did is disgraceful you can't let it happen\nSo if you want to comment on either of those things at the rally um actually I was going to say about name calling and spend the day she really didn't get to a and one more question just if you didn't see the interviews confessing and also if you're a regular watcher of learning or am I haven't seen her in a while she looks different she looks like she's ever worked on it looks great whoever did it\n... it looks when you're faced for gun and I'm guessing she though I don't know of course that she did 'cause I'm a ... not a doctor\nBut men you look refreshed you don't look necessarily what you had worked on some people have worked on and it ends up looking like they're urinating from right underneath their chin because they're pulled back so tight everything's pulled up you don't have to take your parents ought to go to the bathroom a but she if she hadn't done whatever she she did\nShe looks like she looks great if if you have an opinion about that but here's what the president said about um the name calling because it it's a big issue in the news\nOr CNN its its day in day out Fox is talking about the push back on the name calling in and the effect of sovereign\nYou have radicalized more painful than ISIS that was ...\nWell that must be some kind of a sick when the when I say the enemy of the people I'm Talking about the fake news and you know it's better than anybody he let news out there that are so fake\nAnd I can do the greatest thing ever North Korea\nAs an example we would have been going to war normal would have been going to war with North Korea I think President Obama would have gone to war very he had an extra year he wouldn't be in right now a war with North Korea he told me it was by far and I'm not knocking it for this he said is by far the biggest problem look at what we've done and yet\nWhen they talk about North Korea they say what's taking so long and\nHard so we heard that that part of it and he's he's blaming the media the only problem I have with false me didn't fake news is if you're going to do fake news\nAnd people do make mistakes so I guess you can call it fake news when Fox as gifts on that say that the folks who are in the care of him or I think\nSaid leprosy claim that they're bringing leprosy to the country and another guest on ... so the end\nBroken leprosy of courses pull my finger um and then on Lou Dobbs show Lou Dobbs even push back he had a guest on who said that remember we talked about the illnesses and Dr peppers here there are kids who have polio like illnesses that are popping up now due to a virus and it's because Mr reverse\nHe actually said the caravan is creating\nA polio those polio illnesses and even Lou Dobbs when\nWe don't have those facts and then the guest said what they were when you don't have facts to guess goes well we don't know if you can always say well we don't know and food jobs even went yeah I I wouldn't go there when the dog says it's enough already so if you got to point out fake news\nIf it's fake it doesn't just happen on certain networks networks have an agenda and they're making money so you should point out when fake stories I meant\nIt doesn't matter where it is you should the uncovered and say that as fake the eight hundred to two to five to to do leprosy where's my fingers are talkative seven ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nFun to seven nine six four or five that's F.

with this would disagree with this city's required that the minimum number of spaces company any new building or one that's adapted for reuse and apparently lost requires thirty spaces for a three thousand square foot restaurant\nTo spaces for a two bedroom apartment so what this person is suggesting is we'll get out of our cars more if there is no parking and the decades of development resulted in more than three and a half parking spaces for every car in the county and that's nearly Nineteen million\nTotal and they're in residential garages and driveways and commercial parking structures and surface Watson along streets they count for according to this article two hundred square miles\nA real estate and a lot of it is concentrated in really dense transit friendly areas so once they do is they're cheap free parking space in New York City you pay a fortune for parking spaces a difference in New York City as they've got a subway you can get around in LA you can't get around\nSo this editorials take is only by making parking more scarce well we give drivers a reason to switch the buses are subways and achieve measure EMS promise of reducing traffic we're going to have another one point five million people in six hundred and Fifteen thousand more jobs by twenty forty\nSo the way they want to do this is to focus on development existing neighborhoods like where we moved down from on the last ...\nNear rapid transit but they're saying if they keep the same parking requirements people will stay in their cars my take on this is when you're building development like the one that's going up where we moved those people are going to be moving into units two bedroom units that are gonna be five or seven thousand dollars a month\nThat's people weren't going to be taking public transportation unless it's easy really easy for them the problem is first Marlon last month how you get to the public transportation\nAnd then you how you get from the public transportation to your work in a sprawling metropolis like they're so does that make sense do you take away parking spaces\nEight feet are totally [noise]\nI'm like a girl is a nonpartisan hot it's a

the Supreme Court and we say this is really just a political branch at this point because again if you look at judges who are Republicans or Democrats who are conservative or liberal the\nUnderstanding is that you cannot implement this type of chain ... executive order\nWho's going to be so it was going to be a problem the other course and a half years having a baby nine states doesn't guarantee the parents and he writes correct right\nThe baby's legally protected but the the parents can be deported anytime the United states that didn't make a point of targeting illegal parents with children but there's nothing legally says they couldn't do regret\n[noise] where it's been our policy that it's essentially we have a more hands off approach if you have a baby who was born here but there's nothing in the constitution that says that how we have to treat people I mean depending on how we want to deport people we could have ...\nWe could have a conversation about due process and about substantive right\nYeah you're you're absolutely right it does not give the parents any legal rights scotch\nAnd then the other part of this is only after Twenty one but a a child of an illegal immigrant can apply to sponsor their parents legal residency you're right\n[noise] right and that's and that's by statute which could be changed by Congress\nOr ... we took the court reporting and also I Want to move on to the joint of songs too 'cause that's really interesting also um\n... is it seems to be the way we\nLive a part of the conversation you a glove held on to your screener a Lutheran or if it actually gets to the Supreme Court in a low you just have to interpret the ah with them in the ... is absolutely ridiculous\nTo cope with the constitution or is that with all of that for the the ... to a sort of a ship ship I should say to the lives of ... okay at odds with who Jesse Jackson a\nPicks without ... is pretty thick\nMost or just occur from a legal standpoint winning answer\n[noise] um I like that saying so what do we I mean do we have to interpret the fourteenth amendment if this gets to the concept if this gets to the Supreme Court\nFor the ... the the opposite when it was when you live in a while I was talking to the screener but there was a um a case where there were there to do as they leave that anyone born here or a subject that they should take a look at\nThe at the mint look out of the fourteenth amendment was written for the love of it\nReally okay well ... when she got it really is ridiculous go ahead Jessica\n[laughter] yeah so there is a decision from the Eighteen hundreds which I think largely answer this question which is as the caller said and understanding of what the fourteenth amendment says and understanding that if if you are subject to the jurisdiction in the United states which essentially means you are in our country and you don't have something like diplomatic immunity\nThen you become a citizen and so yes the Supreme Court is not looking at this as a matter of first impression and I believe that the case the caller's talking about is one that overturned plus he versus versus Ferguson and is is really ...\nI think in the case that we should be looking at\nToday and again like you said the conservative judges not allowed to do this even the um legislators who are he's this in the past\nNot really not really pushing pushing this forward 'cause they know the potential repercussions approaching this word so let's move on from that because we'll see how far this really goes there was another thing is kind of fascinating\nDrew his son it looks like maybe sent to the United states uh Ecuador or which is where he's been living we've Wednesday the embassy and the embassy in London for years so you said they're going to extradite him so he's exploited and we know what he did the least Simpson mature for working weeks\nUse department of judge justice can basically charge him for reasoning stolen classified information ...\n... exactly I mean so the department of justice will be looking at two things they would be looking at the actual hacking and then they're releasing of stolen documents And Julian Assange would be absolutely the top of their list in terms of who they can charge for\nThat and that said he also ... supposedly\nHas a lot of information regarding Russian interference in twenty six new election and hacked emails that we know where the weeks has published so Mahler wouldn't wouldn't this be an opportunity for Robert Mueller and his investigation\nTo deal with that and maybe get involved with special counsel in exchange for leniency getting information from\n[noise] yeah I mean I don't know if it'd be an exchange for leniency but my guess is yes it would be because we have a lot of information on Julie assigned already and as he pointed out there's an enormous amount of information that I think would be useful that he could share\nSo again you know we all know this but what is Robert Mueller looking at he's looking at whether or not there was some agreement between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to try and interfere with the twenty Eighteen election and what does\nA large part of that interference potentially what is it based on um the hacking and releasing of emails by the DNC and for instance\nJohn Podesta right Hillary Clinton is um [noise] uh the head of Hillary Clinton's campaign and so I think he would be in an enormously interesting at the say the least witness for Robert Mueller\nBut this is a monkey wrench thrown into this in the fact that so he's published the classified material\nThat allegedly other people leaks him so isn't he in a way a journalist there just published published because vital information and that where you would be protected just saying he's a journalist or would that not all how would they make that up was but it that way\nYeah so in the statute that there's a centrally um\nWe're looking for in terms of the person who releases the information is whether they were there's kind of two things that we look at whether or not they directed the hacking and then whether or not they uh were knowingly releasing it essentially ill gotten gains and\nWhat the statute does not\nCreate liability for which as you say is just kind of seeing\nThat something has been released and then releasing it again the question is because he was likely the first to release it can we impose any sort of liability and I think that they're\nGiven all the information he has it we really have to look at whether it was a relief to quote unquote at his direction I think that's the key part of the statue and my guess is that based on what we know there's enough there for Robert Mueller to say I think you could be facing a world of hurt won't you sit down and talk to me\nWell so this is a this is happening now I mean it's it's in the works or we'll see how this plays out and then of course the most important question but it was leaving for away off your big Fleetwood Mac or person one of your favorite groups does Lindsay Buckingham have a case to sue for firing\n[laughter] I Know you're gonna break your heart because now you're most emotionally invested in the\n... it does have a case I I don't think so um you can hear the sadness in my voice [laughter]\nI'm actually see two groups you get through our produce we would not kind of you know him and the group\nNo don't try and make it better annoyance or don't don't optimistic\n... out of this um I think that he would have a very difficult decision in this case and gives me he would face an uphill battle\nEven if there's documents and so he owns part of the group abuse of the group and he's ... wasn't one of the founding members he was brought in but who knows what\nWhat was implied over the years of touring that he's an equal number and sort of a voting rights\n[noise] yeah I mean I don't know exactly how they set this up but you could still be a part owner\nAnd essentially be released from your ownership so it ... I mean this is just a contract sock question and I'm not sure where\nA few minute also make money from them touring your just mailbox money that he gets the other thing I Would love to find out is when I was like this to share anybody who was there was a farewell tour that doesn't leave at that point cannot [laughter] I Do to get my ticket money back you know many groups and so these are funneled to her and then inside we're going back out in a couple of years\nIf you could bring a false advertising claim and a lot lately it would be thrown out before we make it to our lunch spot after we file it or we've certainly could file at yes\nWell I'm ... I'm Sorry by the way for your loss with the things we came out it must have been I did he call ya which\nTime and that was very insensitive but I Do thank you for a way in a number one on the president's plan as far as I'm making it to the Supreme Court be be really interesting to see\nIf this proceed where do you if you have to guess you'll see is a is it done is it just a statement or how would you proceed what would be the next step as far as it's addressing the some of the citizens for your\nShow if I had to guess I don't think that this ever becomes an executive order I think that this is something that we're I think ...\nIs a really brilliant at\nRealizing when he needs to dominated news cycle and for what purposes and\nI think that this is something that now we're talking about President Trump being according to his base a man of action according to his credit ... mantle ignores the constitution and I think that if you look at the midterms and you look at the protections of what could happen in the house what Republicans don't want is a low turnout\nABC News is live and local at eleven thirty I'm Jeff widow in Anaheim police investigating the discovery\nOf a body in a dumpster near Disneyland by someone looking for recyclables early this morning there's reports that the body was dismembered but police of not confirmed that detail homicide detectives are reviewing video now from nearby surveillance cameras to trying to identify a suspect\nA man is behind bars for allegedly placing a suspicious looking device under a U Haul truck in Pasadena Pasadena\nPolice were able to track down to thirty four year old ...
