the alleged attempted bombing of various democratic officials and media figures around the country\nI got fifty six years old he's identified as a Native American Trump supporter now this is why it was so stupid are so many on the right to immediately leap to fall flat\nAnd I don't mean asking questions I mean we're going to fall flat you also jumping without any evidence that must be a false flag attack that this must be some sort of democratic operation you most obvious explanation for a person sending a bunch of bombs too highly public official is that the the crazy person and now that turns out the person is indeed a crazy person\nOn my record show that the guy has a criminal record and his own company is called Native American catering and bending as well as proud native America one low price dry cleaning in a body builder and he's said to have been trained by DNA and phone records was flagged as they come back after making ... terror threats to judge it so presumably\nDissolve President Trump's ball photos and emerged within that links this guy to pro Trump anti Hillary Clinton secretary of what the pictures look like for those who can't see\nThe van is plastered plastered with pro Trump material\nIt's just a bizarre man like you saw this on the street you would think you're absolutely crazy person there's an inverse proportion between the number of\nThe between the number of bumper stickers on your car and your sanity more bumper stickers on your car the more clearly we can assume that you're crazy person so that means that this guy is a complete nut job obviously if you just want van you tend to guys ... not drop you wouldn't have to know anything else about him\nThen it's also the craziest bumper stickers so it's not just CNN Dr bumper stickers it's pictures of President Trump and my pen it is Hillary Clinton with a target over her face it's the same thing with Dan Jones the target over his face it's the meaning of President Trump riding a tank with explosions in the background\nAnd there's a there's a bumper sticker on her to the top you stock of recruits for Trump which I don't even know what the hell that's supposed to meet you know I always got to figure that it would be a soccer supporter who's going to be responsible for something like that shocker I Can't believe that somebody with this van is\nIs sending bombs to people that's crazy now the media immediately jumped exactly where you think they would jump which is\nThe guy isn't crazy he was a perfectly rational sane human being until President Trump came along unfortunately for that this will be live by all available evidence to this person has been arrested some ten times he was arrested back in two thousand two four and attempted bombing threat\nPermitted presumably I guess that was President Trump's fault that when he was on The Apprentice or something and that's the take of the media today\nLaw enforcement officials covered that white man it was covered in photos as I say of Donald Trump and Mike Pence and had at least one sicker referring to Hillary Clinton here's a little bit of tape from CBS News covering all of that the FBI covering the band so oh that is just\nHow bad it looks like a in the same location where a they're in a restaurant or at least there's a lot of activity\nAnd and I wonder you know what's interesting um guys and again I'm Sorry Melanie and started that sets in the U.S I'm just noticing that they're called the FBI the picture that you're looking at right now is absolutely unbelievable what they're doing is they're covering up the van and\nWhich I caught a very brief going through that and I are you know we're not one hundred percent certainly but I thought I saw a picture of Hillary Clinton in ... on the\n... excited I mean listen now to me are covering this who who who who the ban has pictures of Hillary and friendly pictures from and you know what that means that means President Trump is respond he debt you tie this myth and that's what we're going to get\nWe're going to get for it now from here to election we're gonna get President Trump's rhetoric is what causes a crazy person to be crazy so let's just remember\nBack one year ago like a little bit over a year ago a Bernie Sanders supporter went and legitimately shot shot at dozens of Republican Congress people in nearly killed the house majority whip ...\nShot him so badly who's in critical condition when he did\nHe arrived shouting that because the Republicans were killing people with their health care plan that he was going to kill Republican Congress people Bernie Sanders had spent the prior month saying that the Republican health care plan was going to actually kill people and something that Bernie Sanders that\nWith Bernie Sanders responsible for the crazy guy no Bernie Sanders was not responsible for the crazy guy now if you want to say if someone like let's say that President Trump supporter went and just punch the protester\nAdolescent and that's what's blocking in building this problem in other words the other side is just fine but you're not using it the same [noise]\nUh I don't believe that moving your mouse will ever do it I'm you know twice your age and I moved that mouse for a million times but I Will tell you\nThat I grew up in New York where are pastime was fighting and my wrist were a mess I must have done or how many many mud packs on both of my risk to get them to show their pain free and that they work the way they're supposed to\nBut you could do the same thing instead of hitting something or someone by falling down and I'd be looking hard at that and especially when it's only one hand and the other hand seems to be pretty good and I think you're right though that a surgery in cortisone shots\nThese are going to treat your symptom need you need to get to the cause\nSo a couple of things that you can take\nThat promote healthy inflammatory response one of them is bone and joint\nAnd at your body size maybe three per meal will be plenty and then a vegetarian\nDa da da da da da da da da and taking maybe ten of those at your main meal you can show them spit out the capsule they taste good but you would be taking it with you know food that had protein like beans and rice or whatever else you're eating okay\nAnd that ought to make a big difference reducing foods that are\nPro inflammatory like eliminating eggs eliminating poultry\nAnd restricting red meat to maybe a red meat or fish to know more than once per day and also dairy you have to restrict dairy 'cause all of those are pro inflammatory\n\nWell and you just said it's time for you to love that body a little bit better and make some changes and I think that by making those changes the worst guy in town is gonna be ... next runner up is poultry and the next runner up is dairy\nSo those guys give them a Ninety day holiday I think you may have a new lease on life\nOkay thank you get to take care bye now All right\nThis is talk about Marshall PHD this has helped mine live and we get near the end of the broadcast guys so if you're on the line and I don't

talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you could always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people playing out of the market's going somewhere either going to gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nRead a chart so it's a stock chard bond short gold shark they're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that day imagine that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy right you know what if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou would have gone a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the market to go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we can pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life\nWe there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know this the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check it out right\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professional ... guide us through this process where uh unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nWhat they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nAnd it it just puts his behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a happy class coming up in your area they have to take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the

show [noise]\nWelcome back and if you're just using the humans Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and ... structure it on line three and a heavy really shuts of life on this we turn to the market is one of my favorite topics low talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income that's a great\nRight you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy\nThinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have ... fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again\nEspecially coming to this class is that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here yeah\nBut we just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even at the half the class we always talk about risk versus reward and really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nAnother student says ...\nAl ... and training that's something that I had always wanted to death and

some light on multiple streams of income we talked\nA little bit about passive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm gonna practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table could be a dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same that that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this\nJust as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just 'cause it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing it bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right naturally that point you were getting at a before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people make you think you'd do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years for another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you in a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is why I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach your students read out of the gate\nThat if they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYeah and you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big up from the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty St yep same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in ...\nOne year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\nIt's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now a fluid at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to another half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed\nWith lessons from some of our top instructors\nTo professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three and eight and eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can score surpasses there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when I tried to said on the show as much as I can well you have two dollars or two million dollars that the classes were you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets at my desk off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego in a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding as whites real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake I usually just bum a pair of skis from it rather than a hall in mind around but it it's just\nThere's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal that we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do there is to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat they classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taking surely a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really lived that life that you're after and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's readiness\nTo pulled over including with your passage is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the shows it doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate\nThat income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags in bags low the view of these examples of our students\nThat you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you're we're coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities\nAnd that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end what do you say we do another giveaway\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nAh right right now we've got to have to

accurate are they\nWell I have to say they're wildly inaccurate on a scale of one that can there probably somewhere around two and the two mostly comes from the trappings of the courtroom and they uh\nYou know the fact that there are questions being asked them then they're being answered and judges are are giving rulings ah but I accuracy is not an honest with truthfulness I think er movies and and TV shows can be\nTruthful to the spirit of what goes on in the courtroom the or the passion of the lawyers the search to get the right answer by the fact that there's a jury sitting there so I think there's a lot more truth than there is accuracy hey you know what though\nI think the law\nDoes the right thing most of the time you know and I'm telling you somebody who's one cases and lost cases and\nNicely uh we've had more wins and losses but even in those cases that\nI have not been successful not that minute but a couple of weeks later you see yourself you know that jury probably

McClintock our guest is professor\n... Bergman professor of law at UCLA but also the co author of real\nJustice the courtroom goes to the movies Amanda\nWhat do you think is your favorite portrayal of how evidence as he is in a movie\nYou there are so many I I Would uh I I Would give an example from a film that are probably not too many people I've ever seen I'll go back to the mid forties for\nA movie that I write about in real justice a called a criminal court and\nAh in this movie a defense lawyer is representing the clients charged with murder as they usually are in films that Tom I Know you do great work and civil cases but I'll buy a large audience that seemed to like to see a movies in which somebody is charged with murder\nOr so anyway and this is a a film the or a defense lawyers or cross examining a witness who claims to have been standing on a street corner or when the defendant ran up pulled out a gun and shot the person standing next to him and he's he's your classic eye witness\nWho points to the a defendant there in court is the person who ran up and pulled out the gun a\nAd in cross examination the a defense lawyer becomes increasingly are angry accuses him of lying the a prosecutor objects the judge says what's wrong with you uh you know you can't behave yourself I'm going to have to kick you out of the courtroom\nOr in the defense lawyer gets angrier and angrier and angrier and says it's obvious there's no\nChance for justice in this courtroom I'm going to have to take justice into my own hands\nAnd with that he pulls out a\nA a gun from his pocket or waves that around the courtroom uh and the witness who says he stood calmly by watching this a defendant on the street corner pull out the gun a dive for cover behind a the witness chair\nOr the jurors dive for cover the prosecutor die for cover the or a spectators rush out of the uh a courtroom\nUh and at that point the or a defense lawyer goes and asked the jurors to get up and a look at a a witness who says he said calmly by uh watching a will for murder take place as he ... hours behind a witness chair\nOr so I Love that he's a demonstration I Love that use of the testimony to demonstrate that ah it's implausible\nAnd what's really interesting about that is that basically took place in an actual case that was tried in Los Angeles or in the early Nineteen hundreds the lawyer was role Rogers are probably somebody I heard of\nThat I have indeed matter of fact I\nYou know they they know if you take from one person is called stealing if you take from everybody it's research I've read it Earl Roger stuff and I've read a bunch of a whole other lawyers great stuff and have stolen from a mall\nSo on the way over though we're talking about this American McClintock Dave dino no kidding is truly one of the finest lawyers in California acknowledge by by everybody\nAnd it's we're coming over to do the show Amanda says you know Tom\nWomen do or not treated very well in the movies go ahead Amanda\nIn in reading your book cover to cover in of course it's really really a great read fake I noticed that you treated many many movies to analysis and they're very few that feature a female\nLawyer ... positive light can you think of any ah well probably the [noise]\nIt's amazing we probably have to go back about sixty years of my math isn't too good a\nTo Adam's Rib and uh I I think the portrayal of the lawyer there are portrayed by Katherine Hepburn or who really uh uh takes on a a a client who's accused of trying to kill her\nA husband because he's a carrying on an affair or and she said this is really an early feminist movie where\nAre you know she asked the or as\nShe talks about how the unwritten law would protect the man in a situation that it doesn't protect women are that are all she's asking more as the justice than a man would get in this situation to be made it out for a woman\nAnd she's probably the strongest image of a female lawyer and the most positive\nImage or that we have are still even though that movie was made to around Nineteen fifty and here we are about a more than sixty years later still waiting for another positive image\nIn a lot of the current films that at the beach or a female lawyers a few good men was one of them are Demi Moore her character was not a portrayed a very uh nicely\nNot at all she supposedly in the film the lawyer that has all the experience\nUh yet uh I Believe his name is lieutenant Kathy played by Tom Cruise ah although he's never tried a case in his life uh spends most of his time playing a softball or all of a sudden he takes over and tells her how we're going to do things and and she just kind of fades away into the woodwork that is really an embarrassing\nFor trail there's an interesting uh sort of a hybrid between these two and that is from the movie legally blond oh yeah okay one of their dosing legally blonde yeah take a listen to this and it it kind of touches on okay here's how you cross examine but also here's how you do your research here's how you know what you're\nTalking about ... what have you done earlier that day\nI got up got a lot say went to the gym
