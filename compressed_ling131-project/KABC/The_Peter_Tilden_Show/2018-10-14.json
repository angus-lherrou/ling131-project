I see you you are really an artist and a musician not just an influence or not that there's anything wrong with being an influence or so\nYou're influential role because of your large following a is a is part of who you are and I just sends from you it's really important to be authentic right and to stay true to who you are do you ever work with ran as a as a part of this process\nYeah ... that's the point I mean the thing is I Am my brand and if I don't stay true to that and I kind of fell out to a lot of other brands than it does lose its authenticity and I think people lose interest and it's quite obvious especially to my generation I think\nPeople can say about a mile away so you know it's tricky because it's a great marketing tool and it's a great way to earn money but at the same time my early ... with friends the ally and you know with my vision on my ... so you know my idea of an important social impact so\nYou know you went to ... and he's skinny have diet\nPills right right right I Do uh\nYeah I Do work alongside some amazing companies like terra\nHe you know it's an amazing essential oil company and I work with a lot of athletic brands I added asked them not the case that's what I wear and what I perform and\nUm and yeah it's great it's a tough in a mix of them reaching out to me and for sometimes it'll be I've wanted in a photo and tag them and they'll say oh we love to send you some more products and ... you know so it's a yeah I I feel like I I'm not the most strategic\nMr grandma and I've had a a fair bit of luck and I my my my things just going to be as organic and truthful as I can\nI liked that Dina and a though because I think that DNA me that signifies the um [noise] genuine spirit and what you bring to the world and now you're getting rewarded for it right because it's a it's coming back at you with a\nRequest that that idea of tagging an image and and then being a risk reach out to buy\nThe market demand is the company itself is not uncommon you know they have a social media people scouring and watching and looking for\n... it's a perfect way yeah I like the fact that she started her first day of value and you know you have\nTo ... you know back in a day to post a picture in a magazine with the uh do you know with the lip gloss that would have cost them so much money so now you know when you have you know a million followers and you're going to post a photo\nThe reaches incredible so it is a really powerful marketing tool on both ends and it is a business um\nIt is but I always liked\nHer mind my fellow is that you know\nI have a lot of like teenage girls as followers and I just like to remind them that\nInstagram is the ... it's not the behind the scenes you know we're all just normal people but\nUm you know obviously posting in ... to highlight reel of life so every now and again I like to you know really took about things like mental health and topics that uh you know body image and things like that so it's just a reminder that ... ... world kind of normal and human\nBecause otherwise I for Instagram can be quite overwhelming\nI can be you know there's there's a fear of missing out this phone you see the beautiful life that's been created by people and think oh my God my life isn't as good as they are\nAnd I think that's particularly true for teenage girls so I'm really glad to hear that I think being revealing about issues like body image of talking about that is certainly is empowering June to go back to your motto with your group right be willing to talk about it and even admit your own um [noise]\nConcerns you're on a questions you know uh and not emphasizing like you said diet pills or something like that that could be harmful for ... have you taken on anything related to the me too movement\nI have spoken out about it a lot because you know as a I'm a female\nDay so I'm kind of minority in what I Do it's to build boys club you know I I have spoken up a lot about what it's like you know being\nHow ... very male dominant industry and that's not just out of that promoted and because of festivals and agents and managers and really having to find my own voice and you know I actually found that the more time I spent with women the better because I led to\nEmpower myself and I think that comes with age and it comes to gray but I think it's an exciting time for young women I think that finding that voices young guy adding up for themselves and\nThey are they are you know we have an influence or we have the one of our programs named ... six hundred thousand followers she's Fifteen\nAnd she helped us with messaging around marijuana just to be aware when your kids are gonna smoke weed that's we understand we just want to make sure they're aware what the consequences can be and then it illegal until you're Twenty one and in California but she's been pushing out messages because she believes in them and she takes it seriously I\nWhat I like about what you're saying is you know the um [noise]\nUh sharing your insights in your own personal story led to other young girls see that it's okay when I teach I teach authentic USC an entrepreneur program and I cannot tell you the number of young women who come to me afterwards this HGF how is it Jim managing a man's world\nBanned nearly as a man's world they want to know that it's okay to feel confident knew your values who you are\nNot as well but we run it on there that I think you're right and we do a better job they have to hide behind a struggle\nStronger woman right and and behind strong women are strong women supporting him because he loves the headlines or try to find a group of other women who can help empower you make you feel good one hundred\nPercent I think a Instagram has an ability to make women very jealous if women but if you take it the opposite way and you stop supporting each other and tagging each other and you know working with\nFriends at a small business you know females on and really like I found doing that is so rewarding because it just helping each other gray and you're helping businesses going the mole women at the top of that game the better the society and all of us\nThat's for ... you know that's something I've been really really pushing through the music industry I you know as an actor and I was against that I'm just kind of making sure young girls are finding a voice and\nI like yeah I like that Dina Amy that's terrific you've been really helpful this has been a fascinating conversation on I Wish you the best of luck with the next album and and with his crusade and I love that phrase that you use with the team that you work with\nA video empower women in power women oh man thank you thank you for being on the show Dean I ate it

well as a wonderful musician herself as a dancer\nAnd she does a great job of talking to young women is part of her found following but also from promoting her music and a great way very interesting to hear influence ers who create content on blogs and social media platforms\nBut they take to heart their personal values in goals not just promoting content or brands and helping share a point of

I actually think would be punishing ourselves that we did correspond a dramatic garage your reports new claims about the vanishing of ... who entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul and it was not seeing coming out\nYeah well one of the things that is always kind of frustrating to me as a provider and somebody who treats both addiction and the loved ones of addicts is the fact that so many people who are on the periphery of someone else's addiction are left feeling like they have no resources that really on line with their needs\nSometimes they don't even know what their needs are because they've been running in circles trying to clean up the mess of their loved ones addiction\nAnd save them from themselves all the while maintaining the household and making sure the kids get to school and making sure that the bills get paid\nAnd navigating relationships with outside family members\nI mean somebody should get them a superhero pay for\nThem but a lot and you know ... sometimes you know in ... when we look at like ... attendance and\nWe look at you know how you know early childhood trauma might have affected them and the choices they made in relationships later on that can be dangerous too because then it can often make it feel like they're being blame right right and it's not their fault\nExactly one of the things that I really love about ... new book is how he\nFrames this normalization of people's behavior and this old saying comes to mind like\nYou are exhibiting normal behavior for abnormal circumstances and that is so key because when someone that we love is in the throes of their addiction guess what that is a familial disaster and we react income\nAnd and not as a normal reaction I write I mean it's really a trauma is a trial and we wouldn't treat other trauma survivors that way in the mistakes are trauma right like well what did you do [laughter]\nYou know how did you contribute to his right it's a different kind of victim blaming and this model moves away from that shaming and not blaming\nTo a focus of engaging partners and family members strengths normalizing their responses and helping them to shift into something that is sufficient and fishing and write and channels those energies into strategies that are\nPro bonding right now we'll talk a little bit more about that in depth but I started to St earlier that one of the most frustrating things for me as a provider is that a lot of people don't recognize that there are resources out there or they can't find\nThem or they feel like they shouldn't have to get treatment because the their addict partner a loved one is the person who's the author Carol out all the time like why don't I have to be in therapy there though the problem\nRight and I get that I get the anger anger is such a normal response to trauma and I think really if anyone listening to this can identify with that feeling I Want to emphasize that it is normal to feel angry and normal to feel resentful\nThat you are in the position that you're now in and invite all of that still want to be the best partner and the most resourceful person to your left one that you can be and it really is a double bind but so critical that you come in and get treatment and get help for yourself so that you can be the rock that you're capable of seeing\nAnd I think it's important also to realize that you know while we're saying you know the family of origin trauma and all of that might play a part but it's not the right time to start exploring that\nYeah we have to realize that they are in crisis there in the midst of a trauma and you don't start doing that type of work at the beginning\nRight right and I think that's what this book really outlines so beautifully and sent let's focus on the tornado into cycling of what's going on in the hearing now meet some of them were there at champion their efforts to date and then look at how different strategy might be employed to really capitalize on that momentum right\nI Love the model because it's very strength basins and it's so much as so much love and compassion and really that's what I think he only has about ... without being able to find compassion for ourselves mhm\nI Know at train therapy group or excited to roll out this model of treatment and really look at helping partners from a different paradigm and were super excited to announce that we have a lot of different intensive and individual services that we can offer to people who\nMight want to come into a new kind of\nA welcoming approach to getting help for the whole

R. I. U. N. E. therapy dot com if you're just tuning in today we're talking about co dependence its historical roots and a shift toward a new way of conceptual ... called pro dependence\nFrom Dr Rob ... says new book pro dependence moving beyond could have tendency thanks so much for being here with us Dr Rob I Can't tell you how much I enjoy being around here it's good to have fun so tell us a little bit about in your history of working with addiction and working with partners from your opinion\nHow did co dependence evolve you discuss five different layers of ... at the time that really contributed to the co dependence movement blowing up\nWell there are a lot of reasons why I think it works in the psychological field at the time I don't know that that part is is interesting to your listeners why could upend she became a thing in the addiction field\nBut the part that's curious I think is why does become such a worldwide phenomenon right and why we're there are a hundred and thirty seven books published about it and why do people still call themselves or think of themselves or use the model when we've never had a real diagnosis and never been formalized in mental health literature or addiction it doesn't really\nLike it's a kind of a funny thing it doesn't really exist in his life but it's so it was so popular throughout the eighties and nineties especially among women that it's almost accepted this like it's a real thing\nRight well I think so many women are socialized to be relational and so they grew up thinking okay it's my responsibility to take care of everybody around me and I'll save time for myself if and when there is some at the end of the day especially\nIn the roles that were taking place and in place third time\nRight but I think that that is a you know if you if you please go to Penn is he right at the moment what it was getting ready to evolve I think of the movie nine to five ... yeah Nineteen eighty and that was just after the women's who've had peaked in the Nineteen seventies and you did not give equal rights amendment passed men\nAnd women were flooding into the workplace and the my teenagers and they wanted to be treated like equal to men and they expected to be treated like equal to men\nBut they weren't being ... and if you look at nine to five it's a lot about how do we worm our way into ... into letting us have power and control more even leaving like he's not going to see is an equal so what do we have to do to you know it's just it's setting him using way but it's it's a fact and I think women were very much at the time looking in the eighties\nLooking for a way to say I'm we're not dependent on men we can do it without men we have power onto ourselves\nUm there's a great mobility Beatty quota or I could look for you in the book but it speaks to\nUm how important it was for the coated pendant to um to self actualize to individual wait two separate motivated talked about don't we don't have to be dependent on others for approval we don't have to be dependent on others to make us happy\nAnd when I read those words I thought well\nNo man would ever relate to that because men are already assume that it's women who were being told listened there is a different way you can carry power and it's by not being dependent on men basically right and that just run like a bell and the culture for a whole bunch of reasons ... but at the same time I think it hurt women as much as it helped them\nI think so too and I think it hurts men as well because at trying therapy group learn I work with a lot of men who come in identifying as co dependence or identifying as being ineffective and their strategies to help loved ones so\nI think you're right about the momentum of the women's movement really giving the models that we had at the time of ... roots and ... and ... gusto from which to bloom\nBut also I think you know it really is a myopic in a lot of ways for both men and women to look at it as sort of a gender based constrained\nAnd it doesn't mirror or reality of love you know I think what's happened since ... dependency is we've really moved into a room in mental health field much more to looking at love is the strength mhm and looking at a dependency as a strength and one of the things I wrote about in in in pro dependence is\nWhoever said that independence was a great thing and like it's not a great thing yeah those of us who live in ... living partnership living community were happier healthier we live longer or more successful reversal living alone was a good idea\nI'm not saying that it's a bad thing I'm just saying that um that the idea that I should be completely self actual eyes and not need or want anything from others is not a healthy staff\nI don't even think that's the definition of self actual lives right because we need to be integrated with love and with bonding in order to be fully self action lights but I think you're right so many people think self actualize means without Tatars to any sort of relational contacts\nLenny love the underpinnings of attachment theory in this model and if you read it attachment literature if for those of you know anything about it it talks about how when we have a secure base which is our ... a secure relationship and the healthy dependents\nThen we are free to be more independent and because we have someone who's bears are rockets are support loving us and then we feel more independent and are able to go out and pursue and accomplish our dream\nExactly exactly I mean this is the difference between a child who falls down and\nA bumps their knee and looks at mom or dad for a reaction mom or dad gives them sort of a nod and you're okay look and they can get on and go back out on the playground and explore but when parents are not able to attuned to their kids effectively and and consistently enough not perfectly that doesn't set any child up for good stuff either\nLike when they can consistently show up and be attuned\nThan kids learn that it's okay to fall down and bumpy Ernie and ... and I can trust the people around me to support me when need be and then still go out and jump on a slight a few minutes later one of the things that I really don't know how to Rob thank you [laughter]\nAll right now are on the\nShow Dr Rob\nOne of the things that I kept thinking about as I was reading your model is how much aligned it is with him melodies model for co dependence and kind of reframing these again pathology based or in a shaming based languages are ways of thinking about co dependence and really thinking about instead\nHow might we be or not has progressed in our development in order to kind of think about how we want to love more effectively and I wonder what your take is on that because the morality talks about cut dependence says developmental immaturity I\nI think the challenge uh uh I read ... work um which was written by the way in Nineteen eighty nine so she was one of the very like people to the table in fact\nReally the co dependence the period of the ... when it evolved with sort of eighty two to eighty six in ... and this is sort of my issue with it is that people wrote about what this diagnosis is and what they believe to be and then it was not accepted as a diagnosis and then\nUm and then it's exploded into the popular culture but there were problems with the model from the beginning and that's why people like the military thing jumped in said wait a minute there's something here for them to look out partners have issues\nBut maybe we need to soften that we need to shape it isn't but you can't take a model that has a name and and and who's\nOriginator is laid out what it is and say oh well I'm just going to shifted into something else like you either have to call that something else so you can see we'll have a new version of credit I was just like having a new version of depression right answer is what it is so I think ... ... he was the beginning of what we see now which is love therapist saying\nOh quarter penance isn't about confronting people without being overly dependent\nWell but it is ... because that's the model is whatever they're doing is not what the model laid out and\nI really believe in fact one of the things that I found out and researching pro dependence that I really believe this\nOr whatever it is that ... to ... I'd like to find someone to overhaul in ... I don't know where to go\nWell again I cars a collectible item then you should join a club dots and the dots in clubs all over and there's a company and I'm not sure the name I think it's ... only and I think they're in Torrance or something of this nature and all they do specialize only in ...\nI Know that I went to a doctor is a deal or is it we will do that caught in a war\nWhere a lot of specialized in a car that's a great car so we need to search buddies special I don't have a number maybe somebody will call in and give us a number of a place a bet most good quality repair shops you know that she's been around a while what part of town do you live in\nOh is the exact or what I live about a mile or west of Broadway downtown LA last about a mile west of it\nWhether they don't really shop dessert shop that I recommend a lot out in North Hollywood there that works on a lot of these exotic cars like yours and it's so low performance\nS. O. L. O. so low performance\nAnd they're all Sherman way and they specialize in this type of cars and an antique cars in in in his name is Wayne\n\nRape Richard so just Wayne Richard is his name and it's so low performance\nOn a on a ... Sherman way in North Hollywood\nOh well I'll give it a try\nI appreciated and thanks so much for your call I appreciate the call and let's go and speak to a new in Redondo Beach there that's great no Marta Marta I'm getting more 'cause she'd\nBeen on for a while there uh is is\nIt more than ... Marta welcome to the program the morning\nI Love your show my son has been held on to find a new car yet been told to get an id you hire a lot of miles on a you know going to work and do you have any recommendations as far as good year for an Audi car\nWell I'll tell you already is a nice vehicle but it's a high maintenance vehicle I Believe right up front with you it's I mean for somebody that

pretty you know look jury is cardio nice cars like a BMW it's it's nice and and I'm sure he wants to be seen in that and that's the only negative that I can tell you is that it's it's a higher

week I sent out to\nMy Facebook friends and I would love to call you a friend one day on Facebook I Would be honored actually at all you'd have to do is go over to my website and log on and get it going because you know what\nThis last week I offered up a couple of very provocative and interesting articles one had to do with the fact that insurance company\nA well be fueling the opioid crisis or at least helping to fuel it even though insurance companies can't write prescriptions and pharmaceutical companies can't write prescriptions for these dangerous opioids pain killing drugs only doctors can do that but\nAs a result of ignorance and us it on and on the ethical practices these insurance companies maybe indirectly fueling the opioid crisis by covering deadly addictive drugs while at the same time\nNot covering safe and effective treatments\nLike acupuncture for pain chiropractic for pain botanical and a homeopathic medicine for pain mind Body Medicine for pain\nYou know those are the kinds of things that insurance companies ought to be falling over themselves to cover instead of the opioids or not instead of but in addition to show that less people die in our maimed by these pain killing drugs\nAnd what I did is offered up three important things\n... on ... in the commentary that need to occur to help stem the opioid epidemic of deaths in the United states which is in large part caused by mostly doctors over prescribing hospitals over prescribing\nA this class of drugs\nSo check that out that's on Facebook and a love for you to become my Facebook print and then second we I also offered up a an article about how eating excessive amounts of refined sugar in junk food\nMakes children violent and more likely to abuse alcohol smoke cigarettes and do other are not good things and energy drinks are some of the worst offenders\nAnd so how many bags of Halloween jumped sugar candy will you purchase and dispensed this year\nIs the question that I posed then I got this interesting response by one of my Facebook friends her first name is Jana and I won't mention her last name I don't want to embarrass or\nShe absolutely didn't buy into the theory that the researchers were talking about in this very large study where they are contributing a children's violent behavior\nAnd their propensity towards abuse of alcohol and other drugs including a ... a tobacco because the gateway their way there as a result of eating too much sugar in the diet\nWhich messes up a person's physiology in a major way and so she didn't buy into it and she said I'm In her comment she doesn't believe any of it there's no relationship between eating a sugar in the diet\nAnd having a higher likelihood of alcohol abuse using tobacco or other things are and so she said or not true I smoked and hated sugar\nThat was her response\nI smoked and hated sugar well I had to let Jan and know that the\n... that the tobacco she was smoking was cured was sugar most all tobacco is cared was sugar so she was basically smoking sugar and she didn't even know it was so funny [noise]\nAll right well enough of that we've got some interesting things to talk about today on the show for

the show for any amount of time you probably have heard Leslie on the air here\nLeslie is the uh the person who controls a company\nThat provides can see eye drops now I\nDid not know Leslie when I learned about these eye drops that help reverse cataracts I've known about this for like Fifteen Years\nAnd the way I was reading a magazine article or this Russian a scientist who discovered this natural I drop and he was going to give his first symposium with the results very first breaking news is about Fifteen Years ago now\nIn a Monte Carlo Monaco and so I said to my wife I said well you\nWant to go to Europe I said because there's a symposium this guy's claiming to have found\nA cure for cataracts in a way to prevent cataracts a leading cause of blindness that\nUh you know half the people by age forty have the start of it in one or both of their eyes and I want to go so she said yeah let's go so we went in and sure enough there were hundreds of other doctors that showed up there and he showed the research and it was highly compelling and the doctors we all went away from their\nWith believing that this uh particular a cataract I drop which is all natural and safe\nIs going to benefit our patients and we integrated into our practice and sure enough many of our patients who are on the fence about getting cataract surgery canceled their surgery\nMany people who are in the development of cataract and their doctor said oh just wait until it gets worse before you operate they got better and other problems got better in the process of helping their cataracts many people who had dry eyes improved their floaters got better some of the retinal problems resolved because you're giving\nAn important peptide nutrient\nTo people who they otherwise they're not going to

shouldn't be giving children decongestant drugs now think about that I think it's been decades\nDoctors have been prescribing recommending decongestant drugs for children twelve and under for decades\nNow all of a sudden they're saying they don't work and they're very dangerous to give the children\nOh my gosh well their scientific medicine there's FDA approved stuff right their young children shouldn't be given the congestion drugs because there's no proof they work and they might be unsafe experts of now warns yes\nThese have been recommending them for decades research argues\nDrugs used to really block noses and stuffy noses should never ever be given the children under the age of six and rarely given and with caution to children under twelve and yet we have ... our grandchildren are great grandchildren\nAnd our own children with these drugs that flat out don't work and yet put them at risk and peril with her own health\nWhereas ... children should be told instead to drink more water get more rest eat some fruit because it's a viral infection and in the tank sure of time it will heal\nBut you know what you can actually help these kids by doing other things to help open them up I mean there's lots of things you could do keep them hydrated\nYou can also offer up certain nutritional aids that I Know that work to bolster their immune systems like vitamin a and vitamin C. and vitamin D in fact we use a lot of and recommend oregano with Rosemary\nAnd uh some of these natural decongestants sad that you can put under their nose with a little eucalyptus on them you get them in a steam room a sauna\nAnd increase their what are called heat shock proteins which really helps their immune system rally against viruses and they get better faster more completely as opposed to giving them these decongestants which can very likely harm them plus they don't work\nThank you for taking the time to tune in to the doctor Bob Martin show and

continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got that down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush by us that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a expand on that WIPP for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right on the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own they don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around to some education the problem is the very costly lesson why would you want to spend all that time energy and money when you can learn a system and what I Love it\nThe term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use the analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said T well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go and drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the market you're going down and what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... becoming educated and not trying to do it on their own is if there's a simple step by step process to system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's coach ... someone who is committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything that's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my my mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused\nOn the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times we tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the\nAppropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets in ... and when I talk to people is very normally they did they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate the income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income but the skill has to come first and it's that the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody a successful or not it's just like I I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on\nOn how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane up across the country that's a that's a whole different conversation\nWe would never get on that plane because that's a life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves\nAbsolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to allies spend more time at your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job maybe one of volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so\nA lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely we're coming up next to a break when you say we squeeze in another give away let's do it All right well we've got our half the class coming up and your investment in there is going to be three hours of your time three hours of your time to come out and see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the markets whether it's going up down or sideways\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over\nInclude with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit kit is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency and much much more\nThe

no matter which way the market is going whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to\nYou know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income um you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole the whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income\nBut there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit of a multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you're saying in the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like\nWell starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolutions is what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and this is something that a lot of students come in and out of the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in\nThey don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responses\nSo these what I've talked to students about their biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where they're going to be able to make up that income and you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see\nWinds and heavy storm surges so far Eighteen people have been reported dead as a result of the storm\nNearly a dozen people suspected of engaging in prostitution are taken off the streets of Pomona police arrested eleven people on suspicion of engaging in prostitution in the latest operation along the whole avenue court

business owners\nSeven Ninety ... weather today sunny high around Seventy the beaches and Seventy five ...\nGet sixty seven and oranges sixty four in Redondo Beach sixty nine degrees in downtown LA I'm Joe Myers ABC News [noise]\nYou're listening to how we're trading radio [laughter] welcome back if you're just shooting in us Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and having structure it on I mean really shed some light on income over ... we talked a lot about multiple streams of income\nWe talked about different types of income passive income active in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active income\nAnd and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow in and that income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment\nTalking to a little bit about the retirement accounts and so one of the things that may be missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more a more generating more income will do where we're gonna be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot via social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRose got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ... one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets to correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier in the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first time you've got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade in mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world the Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss is set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people in senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira we're four one K. you're investing at all time highs as you might have mentioned I don't remember but\nLet's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you're investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned because we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. that became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever seen that index have been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work\nWhen you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nThe the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high\nSo what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low up or opportunity right can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pulled back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nBathroom there are a speed through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks well\nIt doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight they call it dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging will be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs\nOffsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with this which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK\nRight we just have to know that a Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right into the wall Street's evil but as the customer not client notice I use the word customer\nHas the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize\nBut I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there are so it's OK let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area they have to classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have take classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you could scores of passes there\nWe've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement comes to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you had the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I haven't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income\nEnables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compound annually\nYou can start thinking about generating money you need to retire the right way and again",
