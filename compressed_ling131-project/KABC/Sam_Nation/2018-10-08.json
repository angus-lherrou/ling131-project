I'm Sorry this movies from Nineteen thirty one and it's about\nA a child molester and murder now it's not graphic we don't see anybody being molested or murdered or raped but that's what it's about\nAnd it's handled so probing Lee and so uh uh elegantly\nThat it kind of open up your opens up your mind that we're we're in we're talking about sex but people kind of you know conflicts sects and ... and I think some of the some of my all time favorite films I think we're a richer people because these films that revolve around violence exist I just Munch mentioned one em\nYou know a clockwork orange means streams are good fellas these are these are very violent films but uh I think they help open up our minds they're thought provoking\nNow there was there wasn't a new Michael you're you know more about probably the history of cinema than I Do but in the in that time period of Nineteen thirties there were no uh there was not a board to censor or anything so to speak the women were allowed\nWell in this country we had something called the Hays Code which was a Hollywood's attempt to censor itself before somebody else did right people to understand the Nineteen twenties there was a huge backlash against Hollywood films because middle America thought they were too violent they raised sexy they were in racy to salacious\nSo before anybody could externally imposed restrictions upon them they got together this committee was run by this lawyers last name was Hayes and they came up with this thing called the Hays Code which was basically a list of images and topics and themes that they all agreed that they stay away from\nThat wasn't a law but it was a form of self censorship that's slowly rather than the\nGovernment did get involved I forget the gentleman's name and they started to censor because of the way women were treated in the in the movies and what they could wear\nAnd what they could say and what the theme was mhm so they started the government did get involved and that's how they came up with the uh censorship so to speak it wasn't there a rating system or something to that effect the ravens but that came decades later that was in the sixties now but before that in the thirties or\nThere was something that they put up um about the movie so to speak you move and I think it's I think you're referring to the haves code oh okay All right to know is it so we started in the sixties or was it what it was the sixties and seventies\nUm because I Know porn movies I think they started in\nThe seventies early seventies or Nineteen Seventy something like midnight cowboy which is a brilliant film that was rated X. when it first came right that's right because it was the theme of it\nNow liquids rated X. right ... ... says a whole new I Am now all day and there and I\nYou know that that if you go down ... to Hollywood Hollywood Boulevard there's a huge billboard advertising the do's and they have women's legs crossed so that three axes triple legs and that's how they used to advertise the or X. rated movies not just expert triple\nYeah you're right I ... everything I hear from ... it's so funny when you\nI haven't ever seeing that yes\nWell rate of people being creative people they really push the boundaries of the novel of like people you know people had a fit when Clark Gable said damn in Nineteen Missouri right that's right there were internal memos in the studio what can we replace that word with I mean it was a big deal\nBecause if they offended people then they wouldn't come to come see the movies were so they thought\nRight and that's yeah that's that's I guess that's the kind of the jokes are so they thought well\nThis is very funny a segment and Jennifer Jessica\n... my alter ego and they find where she has said yeah they do worry F is for me and said I like ... where are you performing\nTime I met that Santa is comedy cloud on how to sing tonight and die over and van eyes anything coming up besides that I have a show up at second city and on Wednesday and I have a show Wednesday at nine thirty and have a show at the comedy store\nA friday at seven PM and ... knots and the main room\nI I Can't think of anything braver than getting on\nStage in a country of guts I Would not have the guts to do that and then I don't I admire and I think I have the guts\nI sometimes missing the content I'm like I've really and that at funny point where I'm like\nI have to be more observations it's like a knife with me and more as my ... actually I Love doing that because I I'm really trying to put my opinion out there more it's thank you for saying that 'cause\nI Know like right now people could be falling asleep listening to us but you know right there in the moment whether you're succeeding are failing yeah\nYeah that could be talking to a room full yeah dude and they could be thinking about it I don't know if I'm if I can tell by the way that they're they look at you know ... you know what I'm saying\nYeah Michael if I was to go to Santa Monica college and I wanted to take your classroom was what's the title of requests\nA depends on the semester like this semester for example I'm teaching a course called film one which is called film appreciation sometimes of teach a course called film history and then summers I usually teach a course in screenwriting introduction and screenwriter so somebody wanted to\nUh go to a class that you Todd how would they do they would just asked the you just go to the Santa Monica college website and click on registration and see what's over how big your glasses a we have a thirty five students ...\nWhoa thirty five yeah how long your classes how that'll have like school anywhere else how many hours\nA day about four hours once a week for hours mhm how people sit there for four hours\nYeah [laughter] I Know that the law I look at the new ... good I\nI Try to be good it is a film class so we can mix up the lectures with you know clips from different films of several times a semester will have a screening of an entire film so you mix it up in a way to to ensure that they don't get bored\nNow do they did you do you showed their films if they make a film or\nKnow shore and more of an academic scholarly approach to the subject they had other classes in film production with him for going to do that\nWhile you're just giving them pretty much in Charlotte has straight to film or pre ... film film appreciation\nNow the students often share it with me their work but it's it's not an object of inquiry in the classroom so Michael ... what is your background in in in teaching and\nI'm so I'm a I won't bore you with the whole bio but um I mean I was a theater guy back in New York was artistic director of a theater company called main street we produced and directed lots of ah [noise] lots of uh shows in New York City\nAnd then I ended up\nWinning a play writing scholarship to something called the Boston play writes theater which operated under the auspices of the English program it'd be you rest study with Derrick walk I don't know if you know that is but he won the Nobel Prize for literature Ninety
