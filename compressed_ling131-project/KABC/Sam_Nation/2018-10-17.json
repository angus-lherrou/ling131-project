nine nine four oh three oh two\n\n\nOf them back to the bench of hero show turns out that Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts not Native American but she kept claiming she was ... years why didn't she just stopped cleaning it and then apologized for having done so like five years ago there are a couple of good reasons\nHere's the thing there's a story that came out and tell her first of this year in the Boston Globe and it just got a serious issue for Elizabeth Warren\nWas Senator Warren actually\nA professor at Harvard law because she clean Native American ancestry in other words machine granted special status that sort of gave her an an upper hand when it came to her job at University of Pennsylvania or at Harvard law school was more article from the Boston Globe ended up research found that\nFolks at Harvard said that her Native American claims had nothing to do\nWith any of that to her Native American claims had nothing to do with her actual ability\nTo be granted professorship at Harvard law school they interview to like thirty one professors who are on the admissions many someone from I Know people like Charles Fried who I have a contract and no one we hired her it had nothing to do with her claiming Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that it's time we assume she was white\nAnd the internal documents suggested\nThat University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person and started Harvard law school until it became beneficial for them to claim that she was a minority heritage for purposes of their diversity curriculum or they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of take it and said that she was Native American but that doesn't mean she got her job\nBased on Native American Native American claims\nWhy would that said why didn't listen to foreign a month and a half ago simply say look I was told by my family members that I had Cherokee after my mom used to tell me that my uncles and answers to tell me that and because of that\nI simply assume that there was one was from the Knight relatives were lying to me those are the stories that I was growing up I guess that was wrong\nAnd so I never should have done any of that stuff but it didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory that career trajectory was going to be great no matter what it had nothing to do with those claims so I Apologize to Native Americans are having taken seriously the stories my family that that checking them but with that said\nTo claim that I was the beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action is simply untrue\nAnd why didn't you do that well there are two reasons she didn't do that and both of them are telling reasons number one she figure that she could get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her which the media did yesterday there were headlines\nIn the Daily Beast St Elizabeth Warren proves Native American ancestry there was a headline over at CNN Elizabeth Warren provide solid evidence of Native American ancestry\nSo she legitimately threw out a study the church was not Native American and counted on the media to say that the study showed was actually Native American and then it all began to fall apart because people can read and that meant that her narrative began to collapse in on her\nSo she thought she could get away with it because it would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean the media have covered for the fact that they don't work in Texas was being treated as an Obama ask Kennedy esque new young figure\nThat that guy was involved in ... who's twenty six and bought him crossing over a median line smashing a truck and then trying to flee from the scene and they're still counting at the big new next democratic thing now listen I'm somebody had my license suspended for driving too fast\nAnd obvious about that I was not driving drunk and I didn't crash into anybody it was on an empty freeway they don't ... I was driving drunk\nAnd hit a diet and then tried to flee the scene while he was drunk and the media has basically said that's a big nothing is the same media that tend to George W. Bush in ... back in the Nineteen seventies and disqualified him in two thousand for money for the presidency like two weeks before the election\nSo Elizabeth Warren had good costs to think that the media we're going to cover for her no matter what the media covered Democrats the way they cover Republican half of the candidates for Congress in this election cycle would be post it would be finished bombing in at the New Jersey would be done in the ... honestly he'd be gone\nClaire McCaskill in Missouri would be done Christian cinema in Arizona would be just host but they're not because Elizabeth Warren like every other Democrat knows that there is a grace and I I sort of buffer zone\nThat as a tablet for democratic candidate and so she can simply claim Native American ancestry without any proof and the media will continue to cover for her as much as humanly possible right and then they'll just continue to cover for her endlessly that's the reason number one that Elizabeth Warren felt comfortable releasing a study that actually contradicted her main narrative lines\nEnjoyed your sample serving the division of your show\nForce tonight at nine seven Ninety KABC [laughter]\nGet a good trend or a good word morning remains to be a real drag\nYou get to Mars mcentire in the morning with Doug land and Randy\nMorning five to ten ABC Los Angeles Orange County\nABC News is alive and local at seven o'clock I'm Jeff with all of the Republican candidate for\nCalifornia Governor campaigned today here in Seoul Cal\nJohn Cox says he wants to bring a message of optimism to Californians\nThem and take one day it was some documents that have been stolen and he so those are going to compromise all national security I can think back on times I remember\nWhen the president a four or five of us in the office and the president was exploding over something that had gotten out was in the hands of the Brookings Institution and he turned to\nA doubled and they said we can the team in place it in ... and get those documents that camera that's cheap for that then I realized that was a time when I should have stopped and said wait a minute Mr President\nThinking about the consequences of this but I did not\nSelf righteousness is the leading here so that you couldn't be compromised and that's the kind of bronze it's fatal and was in my life because I was so sure myself when I didn't realize how vulnerable I was as every human being is\nOne of the confession and anybody who's listening to that doesn't hear a part of themselves at some point in their life is just full of\nAnd that's why people love charcoal\nAnd white wash his own complicity in fact he put himself right in the center of it and pride and my my friends we all know pride that great kill us this is Lee it'd be this is our American stories story of charcoal sudden you're not going to\nFor so much more good stuff become [noise]\n\nMouth ... found that wow why trust so that Iran is Ron Paul\nVi that pillow aren't there are a lot of pillows out there [laughter]\nAlex ...
