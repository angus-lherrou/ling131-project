there'd be more explicit about it too I mean when Hillary Clinton's that civility is not required with anybody on the other side of the aisle is pretty damn explicit\nRand Paul says this sort of stuff is going to get somebody killed I mean that Hillary Clinton is going to get somebody killed but the rise in temperature is likely to reach a boiling point at some point here Rand says that she gets
