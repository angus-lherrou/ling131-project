{"content": "And inevitably teaches the class mother and not so poignantly illustrates how much bonding is hardwired in our nervous systems for survival mhm I think that's one of the biggest takeaways and gifts of this pro dependent model it's really championing that and normalizing how important love is\nI think it's important to say that the model nonetheless supports all of the goals of dependency goals or could have been super great ... which were to help the person be less anxious to help them to feel a sense of control hopefully to feel like um they're not as responsible and this was all of the good stuff can still happen\nBut it can happen without seeing there's something wrong with you and you need to go fix it ... we can help that person get a little bit attached it better boundaries devote herself or whatever is needed by saying what a great job of loving this person you've done and now let's give you a little bit of a break and support you in ways that you can do it easier you know Adam who wouldn't want to hear that\nExactly well I think that kids so much positive scaffolding from ... to solution and that's really what we're aiming\nFor here and how can we support you and your effort\nBecause I also think it's worth thinking about that when co dependency was developed people have twenty to thirty sessions and therapy and back in the Nineteen eighties will now you're four to six is what you're going to insurance so how much you really going to look at your family history of origin when you were for if you have six sessions you need to learn how to get through this crisis and still love this person I Love yourself\nRight right well Rob I Love it Dr Rob [laughter]\nKnow I Love in the beginning of your book how you talk about how every time there's the introduction of a new model there's ultimately criticism with that model and backlash and\nThat is true right with every model there are always people who want to denigrate it and that actually the really important ... of making every model a success we need criticism you need to learn how to make it better stronger more on effective in its implementation\nSo one of the things I was thinking of is how many people criticize this model and the question that came up for me is like they think this is a carte blanche invitation\nFor people to become even more a attached to the process and spin their wheels and the way they have been doing it in other words how would you work with a partner who says I think I Do want to step back\nOr detach with love and it's working from that paradigm without shaming them I mean is this model continuing people to always stay together or is there room for them to take a breather\nWell it's interesting when I wrote pro dependence my editor and who's an older woman who's also kind of lived through the whole addiction field as an addiction editor\nFirst thing she said to me is you know if we're racist modeled Thirty years ago they wouldn't have been a lot fewer divorces and and so I actually think that there is it's important to encourage the dependence season\nBut not to see this person doesn't have choice and they may not and part of what we work with this all of your love and care hasn't helped and maybe they're not going to get better and maybe you need to\nStep back from that because you can't you can't handle and they can't handle this relationship with them actively using but that doesn't\nMean you don't still love and that doesn't mean all of it is about love right\nAnd I think it's about not again not having a cookie cutter um formula or ... percent everybody's different and one of the things I Love about this model is just about not shaming people so it's like if that's the choice they make us also about supporting them and their choices with compassion and without shaming\nRight so it's not encouraging people to stay in a situation that might be dangerous for them or counterproductive later one for anybody right but it's more about championing efforts\nRecognizing in normalizing the desire to love and being loved and maintain that connection and really challenged the disorder of intimacy which would be ... I'll be talk a lot about in your book it's so hard for me to remember saying Dr\nPhil [laughter]\nMaybe for a scribes [laughter]\nThere is so new and in the habit um so I mean how would you kind of addressed at that issue of like helping people to really implement whatever works for them in a way that's non shaming\nWell again I think the validation is a huge step is news if someone feels that I'm not judging them but I get their pain and I want to help them through it they're going to pay a lot more attention and so I think the simple steps that we've been struggling with a lot of partners to get them to\nHave more boundaries detach take better self or whatever it is a lot of those been about our miss alignment with them they have felt ashamed and judge into changing some partners who said screw you I'm not the problem here she is the problem and they say in therapy exactly have have to accept the model that makes them feel bad about themselves in order to create change\nIt doesn't doesn't mean they didn't grow and create change but it just wasn't necessarily the time they needed to be hit with that exactly\nSo if our listeners as we're talking about addiction ... also be applied to relationships are not afflicted by addiction I I meant\nThe model not to be about addiction but about how we love each other and there's a chapter my favorite trapped in the book at the end called to so and it's about how you know I you know that I Do a regular a couple of regular online shows and I'm\nI'm I have so many women that I work with her in their forties who says marriage I've dated somebody losers you know I just don't ever want to\nDate or have sex again ever and you know I I think that that's not the right answer dancers how to you learn to do it smarter and so I think we will be attracted to people who have issues if we have issues and I see that's a good thing just and then what I said all the women are listening just make sure he's sober\nAnd he's working himself in therapy and then you've got the broken person who's already taken the step to being self aware just don't marry or get involved with a woman or the guy who's still using heroin is still involved with her ex wife that's a mistake and\nTonight and they have an issue I I Want to end\nWith some of us really stupid but I I was talking to a friend recently a pastor and he was talking about marriage and he said and I was talking about the pain in the heard of a partner and how angry they are and\nHow he handles that as a pastor and what he said to me was\nYou know sometimes I have to turn a reporter and say well this is your marriage ... you know the joy and fun and and all the roller coaster ride great times that was your marriage but\nThis is your marriage too and so Dr cater to back to you I don't think it would be such a bad thing if people struggled more to stay in a relationship with fifty percent divorce rate and our country maybe if people were validated for the love and taught healthier ways to love we'd have more success a pair bonding\nThat isn't a nice thought to end on and so\nIf you have any questions about co dependence\nRedefining it and thinking about it in terms of pro dependents or access to Dr robs book you can always call us at train therapy group three one zero nine three three four zero eight eight or check out our website trying therapy dot com T.

A. B. C. welcome back to the living the dream the radio show that could change your future why because there's a new California law\nThat allows homeowners in California to rent out their guest house in their backyard or to make a legal garage conversion into a living space and this is a new California law so joining us on the line right now is California state senator Bob ... senator welcome back to seven Ninety KBC thanks for joining us\nWell thanks for having me on KABC it's good to be back\nYeah it's great to have you back so let's talk a little bit about this law because I think many people have yet to learn about it and that's why we're doing this radio show is to try to educate homeowners what they can and cannot do what they are existing home so if you can just shed some light on the opportunities for homeowners\nYeah so what we did is we found out that you know there's a lot of barriers to constructing accessory ... eighty use you know the mother in law units we change the label of them so that they become an accessory to your house not a second unit so that we got\nWe eliminate some of the barriers that local governments did and what we basically said it said everybody has a right to build an eighty you on their house\nIf they're within a half mile of transit and that that you had and it was a permissive you if you had an absolute right to do it if you had a bus stop within a half mile of your house and we saw just in Los Angeles\nYou know in in two thousand and sixteen when we pass this law there were eighty permits that were approved by the city for eighty years\nOne year later last year in two thousand Seventeen there were two thousand applications slow there was just it just sky rocket so I had another build this past year a Senate bill a three one which would have further eliminated some of the barriers\nAnd I'm Talking about impact fees you go there you're ready to build and and you find out that your city wants to charge it thirty thousand dollars I'm an amnesty program to allow people a pathway to legalize their units that you know there's studies just saying there's three hundred thousand on permit it you know it's just in LA county just in LA there's\nThere's three hundred of these bootleg units so we have a temporary setback but the enthusiasm in the book was that your listeners and the whole state of California is tremendous if people want to find out more about an eighty you how they can build it at their existing house and what the local agencies how they can help them how they can stop them\nIs there anything that you can talk about regarding some of the local cities and towns that may try to maybe block what the state has already approved and and what happens if you encounter some of those road blocks what what is your one do well that\nWas one of the things is that we said that they you know we put into you had to prove a permit within a hundred and twenty days okay\nAnd if we said that if you're in law was inconsistent with the Senate bill that we pass\nThan it was ... which means that the state law prevail in this local jurisdictions and many of the city attorney said in the city managers they just ignored it and the housing and community development agency and the state's contacted them and said your law is inconsistent your local law\nIs void you can't stop these people from getting the permits and they've just avoided them Santa Barbara was a big problem lots lots of other cities because they had provisions that you know like uh they said well you ... we we don't allow any secondary units and we said no you can't there by the bus line they should be able to do it so\nThe new bill that we're going to be introducing in December I'm going to introduce another bill to get this done is going to hold these local agencies accountable and that\nThis department of housing communities if at all which is which is our state agency\nThey're going to have authority to review the ordinances and submit written critiques of why this ordinances void and then they're going to notify the attorney general who is going to have the power to actually force the cities to comply with state law and order\nIssue the building permit and then we'll we'll get to do is we'll get to move the hundred and twenty day period down to sixty day because it's actually been the law in the state of California\nCities is supposed to review your permits within sixty days I did some more research and found out when I took an amendment that the actual law sixty days we're going to go back to what the law is to make the cities and the counties complies so\nNo it's a problem and I think I got the language that's going to help the homeowner if through the turtle if you've got the cities that are still blocking it\nGreat California state senator Bob Murkowski is joining us on seven Ninety KBC we're talking about this new law that allows homeowners who converted garage into a living space that you can rent out or maybe a guest house in your backyard and Sandy is here\nHi senator how yeah Hi Sandy I'm I'm well I'm you know I had a a little set back on a temporary setback on streamlining the laws in this area but I'm committed to twenty ninth team to get everybody across the finish line\nGray that Senate bill is amazing and we had so many people that call and they have\nSo many different reasons why they're doing it to create housing income and\nUm it's really an unprecedented ordinance I feel that never existed before and you've been so instrumental in making sure you push things fall it especially with eight three one on which had all this impact fees and you know the different cities of making it so hard that some cities\nThat I found that that a skin to you know have a percentage of the house\nRather than a percentage of the law because I Know I'm the minimum is four hundred and some cities are\nAlive and it's good to twelve hundred square feet but there's other cities that are not allowing you to build anything you know bigger than your home obviously can be big and then your home that the percentage of someone's house say they had a small house how are they going to make it thirty percent it's it's just not going to work is less than one call garage\nRight right and that's a problem as well as the minimum lot size you know his family\nWe were looking at language the language in the bill that I think will be introducing in December will have no minimum lot size so cities can't say oh you know up here is a Los Altos hills has at sixteen thousand square foot minimum lot size to build new to you that you know ridiculous I mean look how big that isn't\nPassed you know has the Fifteen thousand\nSquare foot minimum lot science is also you know the we found that to some cities are saying that you know because we talked about your garage conversion you're out buildings any existing building that you have and some of the cities are saying the basements are not allowed that you can't ... basement and eighty you sort split simply\nGoing to say you have an absolute right if you have a basement in California that turned that into an eighty you and create a separate entrance so the lot covering is that's another one I don't know where the the magic number is because what you find out is that a lot of these\nPost World war two houses are a hundred square feet or seven hundred and fifty square feet and they've got a seven thousand square foot lot my thinking is that it should be a maximum percentage of what the lot size\nYeah that would make more sense I think and another question I had senator occupancy requirement the state still read some walk to sponsor occupancy requirements and different cities say you have to live on the property what is the state say\nThe bill that I'm authoring is saying there is no occupancy requirements the banks hate it because they could never foreclosed on somebody's house you know\nYou couldn't know of your bank bank of America is not going to move into your house in order to once they foreclose on it so what they would do is if the city's past season a lot of the cities are",
