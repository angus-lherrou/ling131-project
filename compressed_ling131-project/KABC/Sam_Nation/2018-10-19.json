violations you hear about it from serving in on on Charles River were born here on TALK radio\nSeven Ninety to be\n\n\nWelcomed back as I mentioned parish also new battle has broken out not even really between right and left but\nWithin both right and left over the future direction of the American economy and it it sort of cross the political Baron is really quite interesting\nOn one hand you have folks who say globalization and redistribution what do we do with the people who are left behind are working jobs that get eliminated\nNow than normal answer in the past was get up get a new skill leaked out that's why America\nFans from coast to coast and isn't just relegated to the eastern seaboard\nBecause people legitimately gave up plots of land in New York and decided I'm going to go out to the middle of nowhere and across territory where people want to kill me and we go out to the middle of nowhere set up a plane and then I'm going to work on that claimed by myself at risk of death in order so that I can make something more myself but that is the American ideal\nThat's what it was going by the wayside because we now believe that everybody is entitled to things were entitlement culture and so what is broken down is to separate use of where the economy should go from here\nYour number one is globalization and redistribution free markets everywhere and if people are left behind than we have a a basic income reading universal basic income or we have a social welfare net a safety net and that's how we pick up for the folks get left behind\nAnd those people we just give them money basically ... everybody wanting theater and then everybody who's left behind a little bit we give them a little bit of extra money to make them feel better that they can live better as model number one\nAnd a lot of folks in sort of the Trump camp said that's not right and the burning camp say that's not right they say instead we really need is a new model of how to thing and the model of how to think is about jobs how do we provide jobs for people because jobs provide meaning\nThat if you don't have a job you have less meaning\nSo what if we just restricted the free market itself what if we put barriers on the free market up to orange credit orange cat\nHe doesn't really ... were were recommend tons of restrictions on the free market he talks about different ways that we can shape public policy in order to make the markets freer actually relieve regulations to make it easier to generate jobs but President Trump has suggested restrictions on the free market he's ... he has suggested\nRestrictions on global trade for example and there's a real push by someone from populist right to restore union power even though it is Americans voluntarily moving out of private union not companies breaking unions that is the lead to the dark and union in the United states\nSo that model number two is you restrict the free market economy in order so that everybody has a job and that again is more of a left leaning version so it's kind of fascinating 'cause you have liberals were for globalization and ... and redistribution of conservatives or for globalization and redistribution and you have liberals who are for workers\nNot free markets and you have conservatives who are for workers enough market now the actual answer to this problem is look at what free markets to\nLook at what markets do and a President Trump were really a free market minded guy that's what he will be saying right now he me ... all he does just pointing to the end his economy is and you know you're all worried about technological development you're worried about automated cars and trucks and all the rest of it well guess what\nThere is no question that that capitalism has a process of creative destruction attached to it\nIt goes to shepherd the famous economist coined the term creative destruction that every time a new industry is created old industries are destroyed the car industry destroy the horse and buggy industry we'll write went out of business there were literally people whose job it was to make when we'll and they went out of business when cars came around\nI guess what that created new jobs in the car industry and new jobs and making parts for those cars in other words certain jobs get destroyed till we can all live a better lifestyle and people have to learn to adapt and Asia and that's the history of humanity forget capitalism the history of humankind is adapting and adjusting to the environment around you\nThis idea that we can't adapt and adjusted new technology seems to me completely wrong had it\nAll the talk about how all the jobs are simply going to disappear thanks to technology and\nHow we have to restore manufacturing jobs by restricting the free market it's a big mistake the recently led the most prosperous like any human beings have ever lived in the history of time is because of these free market\nI think this debate is not only premature I think it's wrongheaded there's under four percent unemployment in the United states right down to four percent unemployment there seven million unfilled jobs before we destroy a system that create this sort of prosperity might want to think twice\n[noise] enjoyed your sample serving the division of your show\nForce tonight at nine seven Ninety KABC\nOkay\nI'm just lazy as we
