[noise]\nBased on trust pilot rating of hiring sites that were once I was reviews\n\n\nWelcome back as the bench of hero show so new battle has broken out not even really between right and left but within both right and left over the future direction of the American economy and it's across the political Baron is really quite interesting\nOn the one hand you have folks who say globalization and redistribution what do we do with the people who are left behind are working jobs that get eliminated\nNow the normal answer in the past was get up get a new skill leaked out that's why America\nFans from coast to coast and if ... relegated to the eastern seaboard\nBecause people legitimately gave up plots of land in New York and decided I'm going to go out to the middle of nowhere I mean across territory where people want to kill me that was lost in the middle of nowhere set up a plane and then I'm going to work on that claimed by myself at risk of death in order so that I can make something more myself my dad is the American ideal but\nThat's what it was going by the wayside because we now believe that\nEverybody is entitled to things were entitlement culture and so what is broken down is to separate use of where the economy should go from here your number one is globalization in redistribution\nFree markets everywhere and if people are left behind then we have a a basic income reading universal basic income or we have a social welfare net a safety net\nAnd that's how we pick up for the folks get left behind\nAnd those people we just give the money basically the ... races everybody's looking at her and then everybody who's left behind a little bit we give them a little bit of extra money to make them feel better that they can live better as model number one\nAnd a lot of folks in sort of the Trump camp said that's not right and the burning camp say that's not right they say instead we really need is a new model of how to think and the model of how to think is about jobs how do we provide jobs for people because jobs provide meaning\nAnd if you don't have a job you have less meaning\nSo what are we just restricted the free market itself what if we put barriers on the free market in\nTorrance credit or an ... he doesn't really we're we're we're recommend tons of restrictions on the free market he talks about different ways that we can shape public policy in order to make the markets freer actually relieve regulations make it easier to generate shop but President Trump has suggested restrictions on the free market he's ... he has suggested\nRestrictions on global trade for example\nAnd there's a real push by someone from getting populist right to restore union power even though it is Americans voluntarily moving out of private union not companies breaking unions that is the lead to the dark and union in the United states\nSo that the model number two is you restrict the free market economy in order so that everybody has a job and that again is more of a left leaning version\nSo it's kind of fascinating 'cause you have liberals were for globalization and ... and redistribution neo conservatives or for globalization and redistribution and you have liberals who are for workers\nAnd not free markets and you have conservatives short for workers enough market now the actual answer to this problem is look at what free markets to\nLook at what free markets do and if President Trump were really a free market minded guy that's what he would be saying right now he me ... all human just just pointed at his economy and saying you know you're all worried about technological development you're worried about automated cars and trucks and all the rest of it well guess what\nThere is no question that that capitalism has a process of creative destruction attached to it\nIt goes to shepherd the famous economist coined the term creative destruction that every time a new industry has created old industries are destroyed the car industry destroyed the horse and buggy industry we'll write when out of business there were literally people whose job it was make when we'll and they went out of business when cars came around\nI guess what that created new jobs in the car industry and new jobs and making parts for those cars in other words certain jobs get destroyed that we can all live a better lifestyle and people have to learn to adapt and Asia and that's the history of humanity forget capitalism the history of humankind is adapting and adjusting to the environment around you\nThis idea that we can't adapt and adjusted new technology seems to me completely wrong headed\nAll the talk about how all these jobs are simply going to disappear thanks to technology and how we have to restore manufacturing jobs by\nRestricting the free market it's a big mistake recently led the most prosperous like any human beings have ever lived in the history of time is\nBecause of the free market I think this debate is not only premature I think it's wrong headed there's under four percent unemployment in the United states right now four percent unemployment there seven million unfilled jobs before we destroy a system that
