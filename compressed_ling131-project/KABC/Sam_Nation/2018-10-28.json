{"content": "You know his condition was so well documented over so long that there was just so many chances to prevent him from dying day\nWas just it boggles the mind\nThat someone could and then when you to be done to prevent that death [noise]\nIt it really is a ... thing I mean in our practice at train therapy group if we're working with someone who's\nOn anorexia for example is so acute that they're on the verge of death from malnutrition we have to make a report and initiate hospitalization process so they can\nStart some sort of life for generation process right and industry at a higher level of care and when you're in in a prison system\nThat is a fully contained facility health care's their medical care as their mental health care is our dental is there I mean everything is self contained so it's just so unfortunate that he was missed\n[noise] that's right and that's that's really one of the the important features especially from the litigation standpoint but just from the from the practical standpoint you is is if you're incarcerated in any kind of detention facility you know you don't have any other choice you can't call Dr Kate and say I want to make an appointment\n... ... all you've got so if they're not going to give it to you you're not going to get it right\nRight and some prisons are so I'm over burden and under resourced that it can take inmates upwards of three to six months to get an appointment with a basic primary care physician\nWho you know that they're waiting because they have a broken wrist for example or a broken finger I mean it would take them months or weeks at times to get treatment for those kinds of things and\nI don't necessarily know that that's because of neglect but certainly there was just a long list of people who had to put in those requests so it it can be really I'm a under resourced in the systems\nThere is no question at least for the most part are so many of them just are so far under resourced it it's it may not be any one person's fault it's just a matter of there's only so many resources to go around in too many people who need him that I mean we certainly see that all the time\nConsidering the fact that this his condition was well documented I just love to be a fly on the wall listening over here in those conversations about his care mhm and what what were they you know\nWhat were they thinking [laughter] yeah me too that I Would very much like to to get into the thought process there mhm\nWell again is somebody who's worked in the prison systems for very long time I can say obviously don't know what that stuff was thinking but I'm oftentimes my observation was that a lot of the correctional officers and the frontline staff and the various departments were very burnt out they ... a lot of vicarious trauma they uh\nDon't always\nUm communicate well from shift a shift and oftentimes prison systems operate with really antiquated record keeping system so it can be very challenging for one team or one shift to know what the next is doing\nOr vice versa and a lot of information falls through the cracks and some stuff who work there find themselves bogged down with endless kinds of paperwork and it does prevent\nSometimes ineffective continuity of care and I think that there's a a ... for me personally to all the ... systems out there to\nUpgrade the way in which information to share technologically within the system to help expedite that process and free up some of the band was that the correctional officers and the non correctional staff\nHave available to them make the system operate more efficiently right\nYeah I can fully agree with that I think any personal injury litigation but especially ours involves a lot of medical records reviews\nBoth involving what happened what went wrong and maybe what the consequences were of injury that resulted in I Can't tell you the prisons and other ... facilities are are the only place where we still get handwritten medical records yes wow\nOccasionally there's maybe a a solo packets family doctor who will have a few handwritten notes and that kind of thing but as far as hospitals and major facilities prisons are the only place that are still using completely handwritten medical records as\nWell which is really challenging for any physician who is taking notes I mean it's ... and it takes a lot of time to write those notes\nBut it's also challenging chip bringing the kinds of technology into the person that would explain that from a contraband perspective so it's a challenging position that the prison systems are in often but some have progressed into the twenty first century with technology and others continue to maintain more of an antiquated system that does in fact\nContribute to address his care available\nBut I'm curious Eric for you ... what do you think about the\nPrivatization at the prison systems versus state run I don't actually know for Georgia which is the case\nHow does the proud nation of how\n... of the prison systems help or hurt the non curious about that question is there are some\nUh private facilities in Georgia they're mostly still state run 'em and I'll tell you it's it's it can go both ways I've seen it I've seen them eat better and I've seen it would be worse Mm\nIn Georgia we actually another issue is there's a lot of times it's hybrids so a lot of state\nPrisons or county jails will contracted private companies to provide the medical services and I'm In Georgia they actually do something even even stranger which is the state department of corrections has a contract with the Georgia university system to provide the medical services\nSo can do it again but it's not the department of corrections which is a little bit unique\nThey face all the same challenges whether it's at a private company whether it's entirely private detention facility or a private company provided a medical services they really have all the same challenges that the government\nEntities do you ... do you Yeah Yup\nBudget I mean obviously it's hard working conditions if if you are limited and resources or you're not going to get the most promising candidates for a job and I have field to go work in a prison more or less paid and they can make working in any way rather than a prison\nRight very the ads\nThat certainly difficult I think there is\nAn opportunity you know the answer to what we do about our prisons sometimes splits along sort of political lines where someone will say you know one group of people will say Well Eric aren't they just terribly under resourced and understaffed underfunded\nAnd I'll say that's absolutely correct and another kid may say well aren't they bureaucratic like top heavy and have a bunch of administrative jobs that are really providing\nAny services directly inside the prison with the you\nKnow the seats on the ground as the saying goes into the that's absolutely correct you know and sometimes we see that the uh the private companies you do a better job of using the resources where they're actually needed for at least eliminate some of the ways\n... well that is a go ahead\nYeah so I think there is opportunity there but uh I I have a decent portion of our cases I don't know if it's\nA large enough sample size to be all that relevant but something like half of our cases are involving private companies up sometimes they're certainly not doing much better a toss up for it that's for sure\nYeah very interesting Eric thank you so much for joining us today how can our

show and if I can use my house\nAs an income bearing ... can put a guest house on the property and moving them myself ... my main house for more income she said she'd rather do that then sell the
