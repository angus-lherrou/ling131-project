thirtieth that the woodland hills country club and Saturday November third at the devil tree Irvine Spectrum\nHave ABC\nWelcome back to venture bureau shops and we've been told by the media all volatility in the country is due to President Trump ally as an interim has contributed to the volatility in the country if they exist at him and will continue after you've gone and the media for why\nSo let's take for example ... over at MSNBC obviously a member of left and came to her was her mind hit by a guest about some of the violent rhetoric used by Democrats and recently she didn't like it wasn't willing to talk about it because obviously only one side of the political ... bad and volatile and used overheated rhetoric\nYou out of work or whatever and I think there's an idea of music and other politician other than Donald Trump say I'm so proud or or or or or or give kudos to another politician who body slammed a reporter have you ever heard that from anybody else other than Donald Trump\nAnd the answer is no it's terrible\nRight now it's terrible when President Trump says that the also and it's terrible when Democrats say that you should check people when they said he should confront people in public places when Bernie Sanders claims that Republicans are going to kill millions of people with their health care plan to pretend\nThat the volatile political climate the United states is anything that was ridiculous but this has been a long standing democratic tactic for legitimately decade this actually is dangerous for the country for two reasons\nWhat a dangerous about media take on this is when they can just that rhetoric that does not inside violence is responsible for violence there criminalizing rhetoric\nWhen they do it for only one side it appears that they only want to criminalize rhetoric on one side which leads people to believe that they are coming for you and to fail to acknowledge this has to fail to acknowledge what's driving a lot of our politics these days which is a reactionary feel that the other side is threatening you and its presence on both sides\nLet's get to the right wing response to all of this preemptively so there are people on the right I think most people on the right who said listen we need to wait for more information here we don't know who did that most likely outcome is crazy person and I said this\nRepeatedly I said if you think this is a false light attacking the jump to the conclusion to fall flat attack based on nothing but confirmation bias you're doing it wrong there was a substantial sums for Adam on the right that suggested that they had to be a Democrat it had to be somebody on the left who perpetrated this because obviously it was convenient for Democrats in the run up to the election\nDisorder conspiracy the rising is not good either the reason that it is not good either is because it allows people to believe that there are no crazies on their own side that evil is entirely relegated to people who disagree with them it leads to more polarization\nAnd again it's not good for the country when you jump to conclusions based on your own confirmation bias\nAnd right now there's tremendous incentive to do just that\nThere's no incentive for people to say let's wait for more information was waiting for more information is one of the least popular sentences in American politics and it's usually right it's almost always right\nBut it's the least popular phrase because if you jump to a conclusion and that jump ends up being right your sights as hot back I guess it you know he knew he gets it because it was right he he gets it and if you're wrong you're on the side as well that was right it's just the fact that his ... in this case but he's still knows what\nThey're jumping to conclusions being incentivize on every side right now and it's really bad it's particularly that when the president and the United states doesn't the legitimately legitimately just a couple of hours before the FBI arrested the stuff that President Trump started tweeting about the bottom up this morning so he tweeted out about CNN funny ...\nAnd others can criticize Mitt will even blaming made for the current state of bombs and taking a snake comparing this to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing it when they criticize them they go out and scream it's just not presidential\nHe's right about that one at president from his correct about that one when he says the media rip him and he criticized Mitt well and when he when he respond think they'd like to remember eleventh or Oklahoma City and the ... and he's creating that he's not wrong about that but here's what President Trump does go wrong again just stop there at Seventeen am without\nRepublicans are doing so well in any voting and at the polls and now that quote unquote bomb stuff happens and the momentum Brittany Snow news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republican go out and the\nProblem with people sending bombs in the mail not impact on voting its people sending bombs in the mail and he suggested that this is ... by the media when people send bombs in the mail with a bunch of prominent democratic big you know it is not and when you lend credence to conspiracy theories all you're doing is fueling the claim to the volatility\nEvery one okay so basic bottom
