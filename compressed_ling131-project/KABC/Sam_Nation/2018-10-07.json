{"content": "Yeah it makes sense to me um that piece about putting toxins into your body when you're breastfeeding what surprising me though is to hear that you can't do lasers and I'm curious what the risk is with lasers because you're not necessarily putting something into your body\nI don't think there's a huge risk involved with that is just there's no studies done on the women breastfeeding so there's no clear that her from FDA that it's safe\nIt doesn't mean that it's not safe is ready just to be on a net caution aside and not to introduce radiation that could affect the baby again my personal opinion that the risk is probably very small but since there was no stacks of Don how would abstain you know I write I waited nine months who can wait probably another yeah\nSelf as the radiation that's a concern right\nBut even the ... are just they're mainly hard around a gas that your body of highly ... everywhere and rain theoretically but again there is no studies so do you really want to take that risk of this you know out but how do I guess it's kind of getting into your bloodstream and to your breast milk and affecting the baby\nThat's what about women who have had so talks are fillers before they got pregnant does that impact the safety of the pregnancy\nOr not or if they hadn't before okay the rationale is that it's already settled down in your system and it's not going into the bloodstream to effect the placenta our cross the placenta to affect the baby OK okay\nSettled within about thirty days and be a maximum to Botox right twenty eight alerted us so after that it's it's where it's going to be some\nFascinating Yeah Dr Daniel what are some of the services that people asking for when they have just had a baby or and they're anticipating having a baby\nThere is similar everyone wants to cosmetic stuff but they also want you know some of the procedures like you know ... that last one can I Do that and I'm like well you know you just set a C section I don't really want to do anything with vacuuming [laughter] you know the right or you know both scar remodeling can pick anywhere from three months to nine months depending on how you feel while though\nYou don't want to touch anything in that area\nAnd then on top of that and you know I just encourage them look you want to kind of get back\nAs close as you were before pregnancy before he kind of hop into any of these types of procedures because you can get Ninety five percent of it back naturally if you really just kind of hit the diet and exercise during hard you know breast feeding also you know can be beneficial for a lot of women but if you lose a lot of weight just brush season right\nTwelve to Fifteen hundred calories a day depending on how much you're breastfeeding wow\nWow it's like having your own little elliptical mhm right I got my friends that are breastfeeding were always laughing 'cause they're eating so much because they're burning calories like crazy yes\nMentioned the twins and I ... that that women that have twins or triplets and getting back to their normal weight so fast and a lot of and because of their breast feeding\nThat would make a lot of sense wow for Dr day you were talking to us a little bit on the break about this treatment that you have that's supposed to help women with sensation and can be particularly helpful after having had a baby because of some of the nerve damage that we were talking about can you tell us a little bit about that\nSo I Do a pure pie for you know clear on rational announcements ... rich plasma which in layman's terms as much as I can make it it's all the growth factors in their blood and all the stimulus tore modulator is in your bloodstream\nI take it I concentrated and then I injected in places where you're going to the most nerve sensitivity which would be the clearance which is obviously a big bundle of nerves you know that kind of helps were generate some of the nerves and then the Bermuda Triangle of women which is the juice school [laughter]\nShe's tried to go there and inject some ... there as well because there's a lot of nerves there's going to help with sensation because nerves are just you know if you think about and just wires with Marlon on them and the rise in violent as was conducts electricity and sensation and you can shrug through them island through pregnancy and\nSections and just carrying a child you know and I'm like I said it's like something else took over your body and just wrecked everything honestly don't know what are the worst air being around [laughter]\nSomehow there was a comedian Michelle Wolf who does that fit about how um Mother Nature didn't designed them a women's body very appropriately and she said think about it\nIf if our bodies were like buildings but every time he brought the elevator down it wrecked the building she's like you and redesign that she's like for our whole lives do small going on every time we have a baby we wrecked the body is pretty funny like a door on the\nLogging [laughter]\nFunny so what is the feedback you've gotten with that treatment\nOverwhelmingly positive honestly and and I would love to say it's because it's just all from the procedure but I think there's a psychological component to it as well where where they feel that they're doing something more\nAnd it's positive both ways both the husbands and wives loving husband they're going to love it because if there was just having a tough time kind of tightening backup\nRemember I'm injecting volume into the area so everything gets a little bit tighter and they wait forty eight to Seventy two hours and then you guys can go out of sucks so they always come back and say oh so so much better and then you know I don't have the heart to tell them that that's a great help your if you were\nThe fluid and mistakes a little bit of time but they did some kind of benefit from it right away and then when I see him for re evaluation or another series of objections about three months later\nThey're like look I see the difference I Want to go back in for another round is older than you know after the first two or three sessions you do like a maintenance session every nine to twelve months if they don't get pregnant again obviously right ... it's not it's country indicated if there is pregnancy again is our country indicated it's as if they're pregnant it's again I don't want to waste their money or their time and everything's getting wrecked again\nYou're not going to slap on a new coat of paint on the house are going to demolish right [laughter] well I Would imagine\nAlso they're having more sex after they've had that treatment because they want to test it out maybe back with a that's a good\nThing yeah and I think it becomes a feedback loop right if we have an uncomfortable sexual experience sometimes we might pull back\nAnd not want to try again but when we have the hope of some kind of procedure whether it's the Mona Lisa or a kind of laser or appear pie treatment\nIf one partner census at the other partner is more into it that usually becomes the feedback loop that they need to then be more into it themselves which then gets exciting and they feed off of each other and I think there's a real enthusiasm there when there's hope and there's possibility and change\nRather shiny new toys right you know and\nAlso the ... that they it's not they are women that just not done don't care to have sex anymore it's not that they're not attracted to them are known to be interested to there's really a physical issue and and the woman gets excited that almighty this will help me and they can have normal sex again\nThe bike and realizes that allow she really wants for for this to work she really wants to have a good sex life with me so it it improves their marriage in both the ... that it's all positive\nI Wonder what you guys and they're in your practice because I see this in my practice guys are terrified to talk of there was about sex after ...\n... yeah ... they're like I'm gonna wait 'til she comes around to me right now how do you guys do it that\nMuch train therapy group I Know lord and I work with a lot of couples who are in various stages of having children and as I said earlier I think what I always said a couple of days you've got to talk about it you got to talk about

convert their garage or another existing structure on your property into a rental unit and the reason why this law came about is because there's a huge shortage of affordable housing especially here in Southern California All right joining us right now it's California state senator Bob what cow ski\nAnd the senator has been instrumental in passing this law here in California allowing homeowners to convert an existing structure also known as your garage into a rental units senator welcome to KBC\nThanks for having me down in Los Angeles area yeah great to have you with senator you've been very instrumental in getting laws passed allowing homeowners the opportunity to convert is based on their property to all living space so what motivated you to get this law passed\nA lot of people have concerns was unnecessary barriers that government puts up and I think in the granny unit or accessory dwelling space there were numerous barriers that were put up by local governments we wanted to eliminate those barriers and returns the authority and the power to the owners to manage their property of the way it is a self fit\nNow can a homeowner rent towel sees a de use or are there restrictions based upon what ZIP Code or city that you let them\nKnow absolutely statewide you can rent it out for the person of your choice that's the idea here is we have a housing crisis and we think that eighty use offered one tries to improve it into a combat does\nSo it sounds like a win win situation a homeowner can supplement their monthly income by renting out their space and at the same time provide affordable housing for those people who need it because as you and I and everyone else knows there's a very severe affordable housing crisis here in California\nOne would think it would be but local officials and\nAnd the stations really have are stuck on this idea that it should be local control to every city all four hundred and eighty cities should set the requirements of
