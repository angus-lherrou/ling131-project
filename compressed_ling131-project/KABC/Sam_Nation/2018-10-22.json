E. S. refugees who are coming from Central American countries are scraping cartel violence\nOr where there are kids as young as eight or nine or being and listen to these drug cartels they're scraping literally death and violence and are experiencing incredibly hard conditions traveling on tops of trains traveling through different countries to get to\nThe u._s._a. and you would turn them away how is that different ... in World War two so later well wait a minute wait a minute brand and let him answer that different let\nThem let them come through legally what is the problem with them coming through legal\nChannel here's all you know if if a boat of Jewish refugees showed up in Ellis Island but they didn't have sponsors of papers due but turned them away well I got to where you're just here\nDo you quibble lay people coming from Mexico\nFrom Guatemala Brazil wherever the same as the Jews running from the Nazis running Peter Hitler running your own death and violence yes do you will quiver late if somebody\nThen I got on ... the reason to give someone asylum in this country a threat and run for inviting do either of the name ... how are they in their ... or ... or ...\nAnd Phil American if they're escaping and fleeing for them in the hallway and there are ... are art I didn't say America Central America Central America you say the Holocaust and happening and Central America not experiencing death and violence in their hometowns\nAnd not not not like they're not feeling the Jews I hate when people are putting ...\nOh so you have certain categories of you know I think just like you said that people have a lot of money and they want to build a\nApartment complex what about them they should go to the front of the line number you're the one who said if you have money you go to the front of a line what about a Muslim family fleeing violence in the middle east\nAmerica there on that we are in the minority let's say they're on the wrong side of their you know they're not the majority Sunni there you know they're they're in the minority of this race survival so every Middle East do you think that and they're at risk of extermination you've seen\nYou know the Syrian president using gas bombs on these people don't they deserve asylum here injury so everybody of age\nBut they do more to go in the front of the line then the guy running from Tijuana to get a better job ... did they do said if you're being isolated these refugees you know yesterday they should be able to get in here\nDon't you think of what I Want to do it and you said they did more than the Central American family what did they do that was more uh let let me just answer this if somebody from Syria want it to come to this country and it's the persecution was horrific\nAnd they were in fear for their life twenty four seven yes they should go to the front of the line yeah it's a little different if somebody in Tijuana wants to come back across the border illegally to get a better job that should be a little different yeah you guys keep\nTalking Mexico and Tijuana and using her last name or anything like that and that's that's a tricky talking point because a lot of these refugees are coming from Central American countries\nYou know and as scaffolding violence there and coming through Mexico to hear the caravan that the president's going on about you've seen them you've crack them you know a lot of them have had their living in a murder thing at the end of the day\nOn the line you're still Eric okay I'll has already Russia or this gentleman I have a question for this\nGentleman someone walk in the room and all Three Stooges job go ahead\nOkay you know what what I tell you what we can we can sort of related to the homeless people okay a lot of homeless people out there okay they all want a place to live I'm going to have the I'm going to send them to your home and you're going to put some but those that\nLiterally makes no sense it's not even that oh no no no no no\nI'm Sorry ... who's going to take in all these people that you want you want to have come into this country who's ... who's going to take them\nAnd that's another issue asked me a question let this gentleman answer your question you're talking about the homeless population I think that the government should have programs to assist those unfortunate\nMembers of our society are homeless president sister for a living on the street not by choice struck by through a bad luck and unfortunately you know if you want to leave them on the street you can do that but for me I like you know Mr\nEthic roaming happy because they're paid every year or something like that the extreme I send my heart goes out to them and I believe that compassion and empathy our kids don't have a good strong

Democrat has nothing to do it I don't know how how long you don't want to hear about the homeless you want to get out it's not let\nLet us have our lead me sad that our president what let me have
