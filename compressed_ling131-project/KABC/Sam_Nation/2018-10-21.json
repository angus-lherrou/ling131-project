[noise]\nOh I mean that's one of the major motivating factors for cosmetic procedure is right and I mean if you're ... I don't know if it proves their sex life per se you know actual enjoyment or whatever but you know I'm a certainly they're dating life\nUm you know a lot of you know single divorced days are younger single people um you know are are looking to\nJust to prove they're they're dating and social life um and I think it ...\nIt probably at least um you know and improves or you know their sex life um or at least makes it more fodder interesting I don't know\nAnd it would improve confidence have certainly could improve their on ... and the courtship process right\nRight exactly so I mean you know that's that's definitely the ah there's three there's especially you know three reasons people get cosmetic surgery or correct procedures and that's one of them you know it's it's it's a it's the you know they're they're either single\nAnd or a newly single and back out on the dating marketing you know a lot of aging Frey surgery it's ... for that very reason you know ... getting is go off to college and then and then you know their their parents split up um and they're back being newly single and having been in the dating world for ... years Thirty years\nRight ... and so um you know and there's there's other reasons that people get get cosmetic procedures but that's one of the main main reasons\nYeah well that would make sense I mean a lot of people talk about how difficult it is to\nFace that they see in the mirror with their aging process and certainly when we have children and competing tasks and work goals oftentimes wet ends up being neglected most is health care and so one day people look in the mirror and they think oh gosh what have I done or how can I change the Senate and it\nCan really help them a galvanized some confidence and strength and motivation to be more intimate because when we're not feeling balance sweater physically\nAnd emotionally from an energetic perspective\nUsually one of the first things to go with people sex drive and the motivation to want to be intimate with their partner so on that note\nWe aren't going to wrap here but Dr ... and Dr ... how can people get a hold of you may have additional information about some of the services you offer or what they can learn more about you know\nMy ... with a name or practices cable station plastic surgery on my Web sites a loan my main website is a cable is plastic surgery dot com we also do your hair transplants and stuff like that as well um in our main office numbers for for nine six three six six six five\n... thank you Dr ... how about you how can people get a hold of you\nUh yes I saw a practices allied pain and spine Institute a lot of information on our website about all the things that we do a search will be all for at my allied pain dot com or early office number is four zero eight five to eight eighty three three\nWell thank you both so much for being with us today if anyone has any questions about anything you've heard today or you want more information about getting any kind of services that you heard whether train therapy group or\nTwo doctors started actually a video you can always call on a riot three one zero nine three three four zero eight eight or check out our Web site at trying therapy dot com T.

Ninety KBC Hello Jennifer\nHi there how are you not genocide Hi um I just add a couple of classes I have a lot of questions but I have\nReally just wanted to touch base um regarding the ability to do something with my property and\nConstantly going to be retiring soon and I thought I might have to leave LA because you just can't afford it with me now what what you have on on your retirement funds and I was like a a a great option um yeah I I have a garage\nBut I also was thinking if I have enough room in the in the back yard for for building is their recommendation of what what is better is something you know do the permits\nUm ... you know are they different depending on what what you're building converting your garage or or adding something to the back yard and and then what happens if if the law you know is is is rescinded are retracting what happened after the fact when you still have\nA you know something else\nOkay well wants to end your and so once you have the permits in place that they can't change those\nAnd as far as you know can you put this in the garage in the apartment the open panned a one bedroom apartment no can you put a guest house in the back yard all kind of depends what you want to four and a New York and rent it out for income is that correct\nYes that would be you know some passive income\nOkay so we can look at both options and see which one makes

seven Ninety KBC [noise]\nSeven Ninety KABC thanks for joining us this weekend will come back to living the dream the radio show that could actually changed your financial future and I really mean that\nHow is that possible because today we're talking about using your existing home to generate passive monthly income thanks to a new California law and you just heard Senator Bob ... here in California\nTalk about some of the opportunities that homeowners have so let's talk to Sandy ... real estate moneymaker she's in Studio today Sandy and our team of design and construction professionals specialize in putting these guest homeless on your property or converting your garage into a living space that you can rent out\nAnd this was all thanks to a new California law that allows homeowners\nTo do this on their property\nSo Sandy you heard the senator yeah and it's an amazing opportunity for homeowners right now to do something now that could produce passive monthly income especially for the rest of their life\nYes and I really applaud California and the than the typical ... he was very instrumental\nAnd he still is what can I just feel that ... guy no question about that that he's making it more streamlined way it's going to\nTake a lot of the arguments processed out of it with the local government they want to streamline everything to release all the Barry is\nAn impact fees that come on board to make sure that people can get this done and not a hundred and twenty days to get a permit but now trying to get them done in sixty days and if they don't do that the city they're going to be accountable to the states and the state is going to take precedence over this\nIs he in terms of those you know I'm situations that might occur\nWhen it's taken so long when dragging out to get the ... with the city's because\nSome cities and making that kind of difficult but this is a state bill and the state takes precedence over the cities you know trying to do these types of things and senator or ... is going to make sure that makes a lot of sense for homeowners to rent these pay than they can absolutely meant these out\nFor money and they're going to also includes basements that some people out there with basements that they're not doing anything with basements now we can have a basement as a living space 'cause his space that you know in New York City that people have basements the income and in California and some cities and California have basements so we're gonna make it streamlined\nAnd so I'm very excited about what's happening in two thousand Nineteen because things are going to be a lot easier for these ... and ... you know people that are doing this to so many people\nThat called me and I've actually talked to them on the phone I've got to meet them casually with sat down had a cup of tea you know without pinky fingers out\nYou know English is he he you know I was like oh I never refuse and my ... but in all honesty we've gone out and as a chance that called me in tyrants his father had early on you know case of ...\nAnd all assignments and he said you know what I was thinking about putting him into a nursing home and he said I heard this show and I thought to myself if I can come but this garage into a\nTaste for him to be comfortable you know a da compliant with we'll check and go through\nAnd half a cake ever come in to take care of him that's going to cost him so much less\nThan if he were to pay ten thousand it's up to fourteen thousand dollars a month or next and homes that fence it so he decided to do this conversion and have someone coming in and more importantly\nHe's right that to see him every day to make sure that he's paying cash because I've heard horror stories about some of these places that some great ones out there and there's some that you put horror stories about you know taken a function of how old people and I don't my head that have an estimate ... ... people by the way\nAnd we all do and I think so many people are concerned about what they do with their older family members so here's some options if you're interested in putting the guest house on your property or converting your garage into a living space imagine\nMoving a family member closer to you so you don't have to necessarily put them in senior living or in a nursing home another idea is build your dream guest house right now on your property so this new California law and then have it exactly the way you would like it so you now have the option to move into it later in life\nAnd then if you move into the smaller property then you could rent out your larger existing home\nFor maybe three four five thousand dollars a month now think about that you're moving into a place that you design for yourself\nIn life and then you're using your existing property to generate income on a monthly basis that's called living the dream of\nLiving the dream life because that's what it's all about if you're not living the dream life you need to and we can help you do that and that brings me to another story a gentleman he called me he's in the south bay and he said you know Sandy I Lived in this house to like Thirty years I mean thirty five years my kids have gone\nAnd you know his wife has she passed away the last five years and he's just\nHe said almost some of the rooms he hasn't even touch them that just still hasn't touch anything you know 'cause he's kinda depressed now and he's you know but he wants to get along with his life and he goes to the gym every day still works out so
