victimization anxiety and here's what he said he says during the swearing in of justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to cabinet and his family\nOn behalf of our nation that he terrible pain and suffering you've been forced when you are repeated the tire lines that he and Republicans hope will stick and you're the common touch base with electoral fervor that accusations of sexual assault against cabinet or part of the campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception they were\nAnd what happens in the cabinet family by like every notion of fairness decency and due process\nIt did but here's Charles Blow is perspective to me this was not just the president and party worried about and approaching blue wave and trying to take lyrical advantage of a moment to decorate it was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome that has consumed modern American conservatism\nVox has called at the unleashing of white male backlash\nThis is very bad by the way white males are not allowed to defend the rights and they do this is just evidence that they are privilege so if white males are given due process than that shows that privilege and if they're not given due process and then they get angry that also shows that there are privilege\nSo just like every other major left his argument these days the conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nAccording to Charles Blow the women accusing the white man of assault learnt the victims instead the white man was a victim well to be accurate the actual accusation is that the women accusing the white man of assaulting had any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever\nIn some people's eyes as low he was the victim of political correctness majors overage I check your white male privilege culture drunk on its own self righteousness which is all in which is true because that's what happened but that's not really what this is about according to Charles Blow\nKavanaugh's belligerent defense and Trump's dismissal of the accusers he mocked one at a political rally and called the accusations that helps you'll recall that some folks like me criticized that and said that he shouldn't have mock Christine Blasey Ford because he didn't know the facts either according to blow it represent for many many back against the wall no more states perfect moment to fighting back uh pushing that\nA standing proud and

power they'll accommodate no more ascendancy and validation of the press\nNine out of the word allegedly oppressed there because again none of those allegations have actually been supported by any evidence he said that is what they're telling us and they are speaking through Trump\nHe says the victim sensibility Trump is articulating is not generationally restricted\nIn January a PR I MTV poll a Fifteen to twenty four year old now that forty three percent of young white men say discrimination against like is this your is a problem as discrimination against other groups twenty nine percent of young white women agreed with him and nearly half believe efforts to increase diversity will harm white people\nBecause by nature the definition of the left attempts to increase diversity include harming white people meaning what the last one from diversity is not ideological diversity or diversity of experience with the ... says is that we should give slots\nThat belong to qualified white people do while if I'd ... an actual point to the left believes it\nI don't even know how to less than argue this particular watching it doesn't make any sense if you are saying that there is a group of college admissions which too many are white and we need for a play some of those white people with non white people how does that not harm white people you don't have to explain that one\nAnd as for the notion that discrimination against whites is that serious a problem is discrimination against other groups there are two ways to read that question and I think that there's one accurately and one inaccurate Whitey and accurate ways to say that historically and presently discrimination against black folks\nJust a ... is is not as bad as discrimination against white folks with which I disagree and then there is a way to rate which is that\nAs a whole the left is interested in stomping white ... because they think that there is a a patriarchy that must be punished and patriarchy has to do with the color of your skin and therefore if you are white you don't get due process that part's true\nEnjoyed your sample serving division of your show\nCourse tonight at nine seven nine
