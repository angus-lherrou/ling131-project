seem kind of unsure about whether that stuff to actually going to happen and\nHere's here's what you need to do about the PC to the ... the next two types of protections in this report the first type of protection that two degrees and global warming will be worse than one point five degrees and global warming Celsius\nOkay and they say that with high confidence then they get to the actual specific production and what does it virtually every specific production they make about the amount of damage that's going to be done to the world climate based on one point five degrees Celsius of change\nVirtually all of their production our couch in terms of medium confidence medium confidence means a fifty fifty shot so basically flip a coin as to whether they are right or wrong on that and

... he sees you report it says on the one hundred and five thousand species study six percent of insect eight percent of plants\nFour percent of vertebrae are projected to lose over half their

for global warming up two degrees Celsius\nSo basically everything is going to double\nEverything's going to double or end for insects is going to triple everything as an a double and then for insects

mitigating against that in fact education made the global warming because of the greenhouse effect has acted like a greenhouse you seen as an increased screening and certain parts of the globe specifically because of global warming and that's sort of repeated\nThing inside PCs you report the more specific they get the lower their confidence level so for example they say about approximately four percent of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation of ecosystems from one type to another at one degree Celsius and global warming\nCompared to Thirteen percent at ... at two degrees Celsius of global warming show and it's ... degrees Celsius warming Thirteen percent of the entire global terrestrial land area is going to be transformed in terms of ecosystem but again they said that with medium confidence so they say with full confidence is that two degrees is worse than one point five degrees but\nThey say with medium conference confidence meaning half half is that this change will be really really dramatic\nMy dad that's basically the case that they are making now when I say all this folks and let me it was saying well you're a climate change deniers again I'm not denying climate changes taking place I'm asking what the actual impact of climate change will be and to what measures will be necessary in order to curb said climate change\nSo I
