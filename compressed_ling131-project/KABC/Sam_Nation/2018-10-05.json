attorneys are democratic act that they send out a statement it said quote an FBI supplemental background investigation\nThat did not including interview of Dr Christine Blasey Ford nor the witnesses to corroborate her testimony cannot be called an investigation wherever family disappointed that after the fermented sacrifice you made in coming forward those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth\nIf you think one she testified under oath at length there is no reason for the Afghan and talk to her again if you'd ... commits perjury\nThere is no there's really no reason for them to talk to her second\nThey talk to all of the witnesses\nThey get sworn statements and those witnesses did not back her story when they say that the FBI didn't talk to the witnesses corroborate her testimony there are no witnesses corroborate her testimony there's a talking point on the left that women would never falsify would never miss remember would never lie about allegations of right now\nI have tremendous sympathy for people who are alleged sexual assault\nI Do I mean when when she first came forward I said this is a credible account and and I I Want to wait for corroborating evidence before I make a decision on that there is no corroborating evidence for coming and that's why I'm saying that Brett Kavanaugh attempt on the court I still don't know if she's telling the truth you don't know either nobody knows because there's no corroborating evidence and the witnesses\nWould that pet one of the things that's been put out there by by felt on the

serious about her and if you think there is no incentive for women to come forward and shape the course of history\nI find that highly doubtful mean here was time magazine's covered this week or the time magazine cover this week is of course the lady for swearing with her eyes closed and her entire face is made up of words from her testimony\nThat looked like somebody who had not benefited at all from the publicity\nI Would say that Christine Blasey Ford is one of the most worshipped fingers on the left today so that's not an implication that she's lying but isn't just at the incentives are all in one direction it's just not correct It's just not objectively correct\nIt is true that Brett Kavanaugh has an interest in her story not being true but she also has an interest just doesn't get that women don't have an interest in coming forward in high profile cases\nBecause all they are going to get is the downside is just it's not accurate is just not accurate now again that doesn't mean she's manufacturing her case doesn't mean she's alive but we ought to at least be honest about what the incentive structure it's here are incentive structure are in place for allegations you sometimes you may\nIf they weren't then you wouldn't have high profile cases where women come forward and say something and it turns out that they're heading\nAre making things up so that is that is a point number one point number two there are a bunch of people who are now coming forward and making ancillary claimed to have nothing to do with Kavanaugh and this is supposed to be ... be great developer okay but I was there was a piece in USA Today that woman was promoting\nOn Twitter and what she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh getting angry in front of the Senate is the reason that he shouldn't be on the court to remember the original reason he shouldn't be on the court was that he was a conservative then reason that he shouldn't be on the court is because he allegedly committed sexual assault that when there was no corroborating evidence you shouldn't sit on the court because she was part of an angry is one of the USA Today that\nRemember my angry father and that's why Brett Kavanaugh
