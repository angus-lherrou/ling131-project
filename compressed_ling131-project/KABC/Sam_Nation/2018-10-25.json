everything President Trump says and the worst possible light his comments on nationalism are no exception Mazie Hirono center from Hawaii when President Trump said that he's a national she says maybe it's because he's a white supremacist or an anti Semite we\nShould stop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand what he needs and he refers to nationalist or\nAny of these other terms that these are not just ... it's racism is basically for many people as a um anti Semitic as white supremacy he knows very well what he's talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay Mazie my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism when\nThe president says nationalism I'm not hearing nothing he's saying that prioritizes United States has border security over the human rights of people trying to make their way across that were made us agree with that but there is no way that has anything to do with racism or anti Semitism but just became the actual talking point across left yesterday\nJim Acosta CNN and waiting finding somebody who love you like him at hostile loved him some kind of Costa here is going to talk of saying well maybe when President Trump's national it he means white nationalist\nOkay or maybe when Jemma costs us that stuff I just think that he's an idiot Hiroshima Costa\nWhen you're demonizing middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on in that care run without offering any proof and then call yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journal is making so much objective journalism in there from Costa I don't think anyone or that people ask whether the president has announcing when he when he says things like we should protect our border and nationalism\nMean flash back to ... thousand five saying exactly the same thing the bronco mama actually had this right here is Obama circuit two thousand five when he was just a senator barely a glimpse of the nation die there he was saying exactly the same thing that Donald Trump\nOr a generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally and those were for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line a fee for waiting patiently diligently unlawfully does become immigrants in this country\nOkay so uh you know again that I get that ... way back when was that sort of white nationalist also you know being half white\nI get that he was white nationalist as well it wasn't just getting a cost I who at this point basically everything that he says to me preface of your diary because he says all the quiet stuff out loud it was also anything you'd get around that are more objective journalists being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean under tones that are not just racial that Xena phobic this is something to the presence in sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase of the ban and uh obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow looking I'm somebody who said that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think that nationalism alone is enough I think there are ties that bind us\nIt has a history and culture but what actually make the United states the United states is the root idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution backed by two thousand years\nOf Judeo Christian History or rather three thousand years Judeo Christian History and that's what makes the United states the United states is the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states' unique\nData unique I get in world history so I'm not such a big fan either of the president using nationalistic language but you suggest as white supremacy is anything\nBut again this comes back to the basic idea and you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise the meet me hackles of people on the
