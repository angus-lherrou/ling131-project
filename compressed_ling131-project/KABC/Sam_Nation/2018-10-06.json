Democrats tried to say that judge Kavanaugh shouldn't be on the Supreme Court first 'cause he was a texture less then because he was an alleged rapist and because he was an alleged gang rape is I mean is he from ice and to do back in college then because he got angry when you little ledge that he committed rape\nOr that that is their latest stat one of the people pushing that stories John Paul Stevens a former Supreme Court justice thank God for the former\nAnd he said that Brett Kavanaugh's performance during Senate confirmation hearing suggested that he lacks the temperament for the job\nAnd here's what he here's what he said that at the time I thought cabinet had the qualifications for the Supreme Court should he be selected I changed my views for reasons that have no relationship to his intellectual ability I feel his performance in the hearing ultimately changed my mind\nHe said that there's merits and the criticism that he has political bias and I'm saying there's a lot this morning this is the last ten Brett Kavanaugh cried recovered that emotional and Brett Kavanaugh as part of it and I saw that today it doesn't matter even though it was emotional isn't it matters that he was part of it because she said the Democrats were out to get him\nOr alternatively Brett Kavanaugh was saying something that isn't pleasantly true that Democrats were asked to get him remember the original opposition Brett Kavanaugh and then he was attached to it and it became he was a gang rape is let's say that you had spent the last forty years of your life in public service\nAnd that somebody you never knew\nHim for with an allegation against you accusing him of gang rape and the people who are opposed you politically the same people who said that they ... because we were attacked us then came forward and said we think that you are also a gang rape is Mike and say wait a second this feels like a partisan hit job\nMight you say that or does that make it to park and it's amazing it really is amazing only folks who say initial temperament first of all these folks have never met a judge\nAnd there are lots of judges who are angry there are lots of judges who have personality issues like this idea that all judges are sort of ... on the hill dispense justice from beneath the palm tree it's just not true it's just natural but the question was you know temperament is how do you approach cases when you're on the bench and we have twelve years of\n... fourteen years I got a of Brett Kavanaugh on the federal bench while he was twelve years a wreck happened on the federal bench\nNo indicator that there was any problem with his judicial temperament was a moderate moderate conservative on the bench\nAnd then he went through a full Senate hearing you remember they remember there was a whole set of sending Harris before this whole garbage news cycle yeah there's a whole set of Senate hearings where he went through silly questions from senators and you had the grandstanding by Kamala Harris and Corey potato head bolder\nAnd they went through the entire here\nAnd he was laughed at Wright was do that was the the rent on him he was to do was to robotic\nAnd then he would say that twelve years on the bench lasted a full hearing poised class it\nAnd then shockingly people accused him of gang rape and he got a little mad and that was my God how he met look at that that that's a failure of judicial temperament it turns out that people react differently to different stimuli and you give me a massage had a different thing when you walk in the in the back and I had with a two by four I react slightly differently\nIf you massage mayor Norma Susan I can sense your touch and I'm probably going to be placid unhappy if however you clock me in the back of the head with a two by four I might be justifiably angry and I might be you know missed enough to turn around and try to walk it back in the face\nThat's what happened to write Kavanaugh but apparently that's no good at showing who have not really it he wrote a piece for the wall Street Journal\nTrying to defend his behavior and apologizing for being so emotional I like that at the time he goes no apology to anyone on any of that none if I'd been Brett Kavanaugh and people would accuse me of that I Would have gone into that room and I said let me be clear I Want this right into
