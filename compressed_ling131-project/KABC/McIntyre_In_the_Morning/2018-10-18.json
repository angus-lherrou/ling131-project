harder to make the recruitment quotas for a variety of reasons one the economy is good so there's a lot of options\nUh there's a lot of people who don't obviously have an inclination to joined the military uh and that's certainly they're right and and freedom to do so but then there's other issues like\nGang affiliations in criminal records and I know that at Fort Lewis in in Washington they were actually having to have a um a tattoo removal program to to remove gang tattoos from young recruits et cetera but now this obesity problem is clearly becoming a major issue\nRight so like you mentioned it's about Seventy percent actually of young Americans are not eligible to join the army and that is\nAgain like you said for a multitude of reasons they got out of high school diploma or a GED they might not they might have a chronic medical issues that the services are willing to take on 'em or it might have some sort of misconduct background\nAnd that could be a million things that could be actual criminal criminal charges or criminal um\nCriminal conviction and it can also just eight they were had that she will marijuana users in the past but once they get in the door if they

recruits to to lose thirty to forty pounds within the first couple of months of training because they are working so hard and not eating as much as there used to\nBut you can spend a long time in the army and content that weight can continue to creep back on you so it's not even just that that once once you've made it in and you let all these standards that set the army deals with\nWith obesity as something that costs a lot of money and causes a lot of injuries that keeps a lot of people out of out of deploy ability like they can't they they can't go to Afghanistan to can't go to Iraq because

then getting a threat from one of the guys who was doing the um\nCutting off the fingers to show before they\nHeaded and dismembered to show you're saying if you want to come back to Saudi Arabia alive than shut up that was a threat to the council gentle that spurred\nWhat we saw yesterday which was the eventual a search and an investigation at the council general's residence which they asked Saudi Arabia for in Turkey for two weeks in Saudi Arabia tonight each and every time that they were asking for it until\nForty eight hours going that council general fled the country to go back to Saudi Arabia and then the Turks had access to the place\nWe're talking with Michael by our NBC News uh reporting for us\nUh this is a almost a cartoonish a I mean if the crime wasn't so horrible implications so horrible but I mean the delay the denial of cleaning really changing rooms or ... I mean you can't make it up so farcical\nAnd where did this word of this audio tape counseling because there were initial reports to show you had started his apple I watch to record something and we thought well maybe that's what this is according to the church this is something completely different so are they bugging\nYeah I'm In adding some sort of hitting us of course they clearly they bought the place in the apple watch\nCover you know because they didn't want to they had bugged constantly because I assume every consulate everywhere in the world is bug\nA everywhere but but that aside and then there's the politics of all of this Saudi Arabia or is a dubious ally of the United states a ... and I\nCall them that for a lot of reasons mostly because the repression of human rights the a novel dealing the funding of hobby is um an outright terrorism as long as it wasn't directed internally at in Saudi Arabia they were fine with it the hijackers who came from Saudi Arabia including bin Laden himself yeah\nSo lots and lots of problems with that bought Saudi Arabia also does a lot of dirty work for the United states we do rendition and Saudi Arabia we do they do a covert operations for the United states in the middle east\nAnd there are they also leverage their power with other Arab states\nAh ... presumably to advance U.S interests and of course they get billions of dollars in military aid from the U.S and that's on the line with as we haven't Lindsey Graham has been water caring for Donald Trump is outright saying we're going to sanction the hell out of them\nYeah and I think that all comes from this concern about this happening in a foreign land if this is something that happened in Saudi Arabia on their own territory maybe you could kind of ride it out to say well this is you taking care of your own family business we understand that element of it but if you try to say that while it's taking place in a foreign country that becomes a different issue in an international basis and I think that's where the concerns plus\nThis has risen to a level where you know whether or not this journalist journalist ... is an individual's of any important to anybody who hears this story\nThis level of the type of violence that we're hearing about that happen to a foreign country has escalated\nWorldwide so we've gotten to this much higher level of awareness regarding the story in general but you're right because there are now more questions coming President Trump's away you know was he causing their cover and creating a cover for Saudi Arabia has he been doing that ever since we know on Tuesday and this is just the optics of it there was a hundred million dollar payment to Saudi from Saudi Arabia to the U.S\nIn regards to the U.S stabilization efforts in Syria and while that was planned back in August the only thing that was missing here guys with a greasy paper bag to put that hundred million dollars in at least from the appearances of what looks like kind of a hush money situation to the U.S\nAnd then you couple that with the fact that certain senators are saying that the Trump Administration is saying they aren't going to inform the senators whatsoever on any information they've got about ... and you've got a lot more questions that are coming up in regards to this and how the relationship will be going forward between the U.S Saudi Arabia\nAnd Michael just a quick final question do you think that the crown prince actually under estimate of the world's response to this\nOh I think he most certainly did I think he was certainly thought you know here's this journalist and nobody cares about this is just something that we're going to deal with it will happen quietly under the table and the\nBy the way the fact that it's happening in Turkey and turkey doesn't want to necessarily ruin a relationship although they haven't been exactly friendly with Saudi Arabia I don't know that they necessarily want to come out with all of this I think that was all underestimated him his\nBath or Michael by our reporting for us thanks so much Michael a remote due to a this story is I I I really think ah that it's\nUtterly fascinating if the government of Saudi Arabia had murdered and dismembered\nA cause she'll be within the borders and I've even heard about it it would just be a tiny little filler story that I wrote an op ed pieces for the ... just ... I haven't heard from it but the fact that they did it\nOverseas or in Turkey and specifically that they did it in a foreign embassy\nWhich is supposed to be a sanctuary I mean that's where people go for sanctuary but they waited until one of their own foreign nationals one of their own citizens came into a I mean when you were citizens travel abroad and you have a problem the first thing you do is you got to ... her the way he got it right and you go there for\n... I had all of my passport stolen in Spain and we're in a primary care that yeah I Do that's what you have to have\nA and instead of finding sanctuary he apparently was tortured and died while I I must caution everybody because it's been so widely reported about this audio tape of him as fingers\nBeing cut off all while he's alive and all these groups we don't know we really don't know because that tape hasn't been made available now I'm very well may be the case\nBut I'm just saying that uh you know there's politics being played here that's not only\nRelated to the U.S in Saudi Arabia but there's the Turkish Saudi relationship and God Knows what that and yeah I mean we got hurt hurt him on the the thug who runs dark Yankee so who knows what that is I'm not even going to pretend\nThat an inkling of what the nature of language put out selectively ... could be true\nAnd based on the behavior of the Saudis\nBringing in cleaning crews and painting the room and blah blah blah blah blah and not letting people in a couple of weeks ... why don't they just show us what they were using the bones saw I mean we don't even know that that's true you see that all we ever thought they were so it may be true\nUh ... and now the question for the U.S is\nAssuming it is true what do we do about it and I absolutely am with uh I\nI'm absolutely with Lindsey Graham on this I think that the arms deal should be put on ice I think that sanctions should be slapped on Saudi Arabia oh Trump's not going to like that that\nYou know and still has to happen you can't just let it go and nothing happened\nUh but that it looks like that's the inclination because up and here's where here's where the secret state the dark state if you will are really hurts us because we have no idea\nWhat Saudi Arabia is doing for us in terms of covert overt operations and therefore\nUh the reluctance of not just this administration but every remember one Brock Obama went over and vowed to the king of Saudi Arabia and all the right wing people that conservatives roll up in arms he's vowing to the foreign and we've been kissing they're asked for since Eisenhower yeah\nA George W. Bush had the the the king or to the to the ranch in it to his place in Texas a for a barbecue and stay over a sleep over and called the Saudis are eternal friends\nSo it's not just Donald Trump that has been kissing the Saudi royal family's ass and the reason part of it was oil and part of it is their willingness to do things that we don't want to do ourselves because of human rights concerns that they don't have\nYou know he liked to keep bombing the crap out of Yemen yeah\n... ... ... ... yes at some level we do and and we liked the fact that if there's a a terror suspect it gets picked up somewhere in the world and we want him a rubber hoses them but we can't do it we send them to Riyadh and let them do it\nUh that's called rendition you just send it over there and then you have what CIA guys standing in the back of the room on the Saudis do it so there's all kinds of things in play here uh and that may be the reluctance of the administration to come down to heart and the Saudis and every other administration to come down too hard on the Saudis\nBut the bottom line is that the world has changed because incidents like this don't stay as a tiny little newspaper article in you know page is see see twenty eight you know underneath the futon ads they spread through social media and they become\nA cost celebs and rightly so by the way\nAnd it's a catastrophe for Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia and the crown prince ironically we're trying at least superficially to change their image spending of fortune on public relations consultant granting women the right to drive

Thirteen hundred communities in the United states that have no daily news coverage at all oh\nA and this is a after a study by the University of North Carolina school of media journalism roughly twenty percent of the country's metro and community newspapers have stopped their precious or merged with other newspapers since ... two thousand four\nAnd that's a decrease for approximately nine thousand newspapers a little more than seven thousand online news sites have cropped up to fill the gaps left by disappearing newspapers but those sites usually have trouble attracting funding or enough visitors to be self sufficient\nAnd they certainly don't have the resources to assign reporters to go cover stories and look a lot of community newspapers is not like they're breaking scandals and cracking city all but to do things I covered in high school sports more local weather or a local businesses and they type people to the community\nAnd the communities up a little or no news

allegations are brought to light you were obliged to believe them without any sort of corroborating evidence a need to be really hurtful um when that happens that\nThe just an allegation enough should not be enough to to convict someone or something like murder you're talking about ... super serious\nYou really need to to to\nFind other evidence to suggest that the person did it and so I went back and I I started looking at the details of what happened to Gary ... of course some other individual's name was ... was convicted of killing Sean ... um he was ordered to have a new trial I should add up because\nThere was a procedural err on the part of the prosecution failed to to turn it over the proper documents to the fence and so there was going to be a real trial and you spent quite a quite a bit of time in prison and\nThen they said you know what will spoke settle for just deport it come back to El Salvador because the guy was a criminal illegal aliens but what the ...\nBut he did to Gary Condit is really criminal I mean if you go back and look at the stories it ranged from everything from she died having sex at his house tied up in bondage gear right to a horse whisper told ... dominant done\nThat um that the that Garry had her killed and someone from a motorcycle game was the one that took her away and put her on a plane and push during the Atlantic ocean within were somewhere between Europe and the United states the Palos ... on on Fox News had\nSylvia brown a psychic and and other psychics I'm On the show to speculate ... he was and they all seem to indicate that Gary Condit had something to do with it the Washington Post in particular\nWere awful because they committed the sense that we're seeing committed right and left today and that is if someone makes an allegation even if there's no other independent evidence they print it because well you know blah blah blah set it\nIn their particular case it was the levy family the leaders family was going to the Washington Post and they were saying oh it's not just shot under that he was having an affair with\nThere's another woman from a desk job who was I Believe under age at the time because it was having an affair with\nAnd the father told us\nWell the Washington Post prince this big bombshell report for whatever reason they were working on the story with the Modesto be which was his local paper they do their big bombshell report turns out\nThe guy was a crackpot ... his mother was a crackpot no one talked to the woman in question who who emphatically denied all of this and they printed a series of stories claiming that Gary Condit slept\nWith this under aged intern and ... what happened was virtually everyone in the country just assume that he killed her when the guy had nothing to do with it when\n... was brought to trial and and his defense attorneys were looking for ways to get them off what they did was\nThey went back and they looked at all these stories and they said well we're just going to blame Gary Condit\nSo that's what they did it the trial and the ... the most sympathetic people in the whole situation outside of Sondra course acknowledged under oath that they were just making things up because they were mad at Gary Condit because they thought that he was hiding something\nAnd if they lied about him it would\nKeep attention on the case it it might find their daughter it might cause people to keep looking for their daughter\nWell look at it this is\nA you know it's interesting John you and I have jumped off the air about this that uh when someone gets arrested a because we're in and talk radio of course they're guilty [laughter] we're we're from law enforcement of sure you're right you got arrested of course you are\nA ... and the truth of the matter is the presumption of innocence is only something that's required of a jury\nA and the system it's not required of we the people and people have strong opinions about people all the time and situations I for instance side you know I absolutely believe that the Saudi crown prince had cars show he murdered in the Saudi consulate in Saudi Arabia do I have any evidence of it now\nAh and I don't even know that we can transcend any evidence I don't even know if this so called tape of the execution exists I just believe that they whack them\nA ... you know if I was on a jury I'd have to behave differently than that but I'm not but but you're right in the sense that the rush to judgment can be I can have real world consequences I'll give you a perfect example\nThere's a story any uh that that's still in the news of this woman uh who came home to a condominium\nAnd uh she wouldn't let this a black guy who lived in the same apartment complex she didn't know him but she wouldn't let him into his own apartment and we talked about it ... or two days ago\nAnd that we played the sound of it and the sound is really bad it's like why is this blonde woman with the little dog in the least hassling this guy trying to get into his own place just because she didn't recognize him\nWell it turns out there is more to that story apparently she's married to a black guy and apparently he didn't have the\nKey to the exterior gate to get in a and she sang luck he didn't have the key to get into the next year gate a\nAnd I'm following the protocols that we were taught by the condo association don't let anybody in who you don't recognize so there's some mitigating stuff that was not part of the original report and again if you don't include that in the coverage\nIt
