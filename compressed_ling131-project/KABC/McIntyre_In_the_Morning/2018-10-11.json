A. B. C. auto Thursday morning the eleventh day of October so yesterday was a tough day uh for the markets to say the least it was it some day in general because hurricane Michael just churned up\nOf Florida and a Georgian is headed to the Carolinas and this storm was everything they said it was going to be was practically is a category five when it came ashore and stayed as a category too deep into Georgia which is a fast moving storm but we're maintained a tremendous amount of energy\nSo uh we'll get a much clearer picture of exactly the magnitude of the of the damage\nOr later today as a first responders were able to get out and search your broader area but while they're out they're searching how about searching for the cause of why the\nThe Dow uh took such a huge dip too but\nWe'll start this morning with hurricane Michael and joining us right now from Destin, Florida one of the hardest\nHit areas is capable contributor a David sharing David good morning Sarah morning guys how are you\nI'm okay how did you make out in the storm yesterday well\nYou know or to be honest with you here in Destin we were spared because that that storm did take that the right turn and go into the big band of the of the Florida Panhandle but\nWe were spared here we've got a few uh boats that were uplifted for more engine or you know floating around the debate but uh that's a different picture what we're seeing now the west of here kind of a city\nPanama City beach in Mexico beach took a direct hit with this thing and it's absolutely catastrophic that devastation so that's what we're dealing with ...\nAnd the storm unfortunately behaved exactly as predicted it gains strength the closer it came to shore as opposed to a Hurricane Florence a which was an Atlantic storm last energy as it came up short brought a lot of rain and was very slow moving so it created a tremendous amount of flooding havoc in the Carolinas\nThis storm had a sustained winds north of a hundred and fifty miles an hour just a few miles an hour below a category five and amazingly as he mentioned the intro this was still a category ... storm after they moved into Georgia after having traveled you know a hundred hundred and a half miles\nYeah I just looked at the radar about an hour ago it still has an odd that you couldn't believe that it still has an eye wall and it was passed indirectly over Augusta, Georgia played the masters but they're staying grew in three days into it\nMuch of a store and the one big reason why did that is on the east coast of Florida\nHeading north up and had all the water there is very first of all the very very warm eighty five degrees is very warm but the other main reason is the fact that it's so shallow some of those areas are\nAre no more than four feet deep in it and so when you have shallow water like that there's no cold water underneath the coup fail\nSo what it was doing it was just suck it up all this hot water and and just go to this category for some people are color category because of the middle of artwork category five status but the women's work because of the ... believe it or not going to catch up to what the score yeah to uh to create that but\nIt it's just unbelievable now of course we\nWe picked up and rebuild the city is what this is going to take years to do\nYeah well thank you for being with us David appreciate it and

they're anticipating inflation as well so there are a number of a reality that apparently all coincided yesterday because the week before the stock market was firing on all cylinders and everything was great after those unemployment figures came out and now all of a sudden reality hit\nWell yeah a form of reality because\nYou know the interest rates is a one solid tangible thing that you can sink your teeth into the president or by the way of course a criticize the fed yesterday for that uh there was a headline in Barron's Magazine that may have some this up better than anything\nThe

it's been really good for so long it's like I think that there's just this is some kind of see with in us that we say this can't possibly by the way it can't possibly less what goes up always goes down\nBut there is no actual tangible ... reason for people to be freaking out and just see an eight hundred point loss in one day I mean it just it's almost like a stampede for the exits\nAnd uh there are some signs though that uh the brakes on this long recovery that we've been having for a while now uh are are starting to be realized\nOr does things that are the trade war is having an

well\nAh how do the markets look this morning\nWe're going to see a a down opening but whenever this happens when you see such a huge drop you find the bargain hunters swooping in because they think

points and now the same people who were telling you yesterday that everything is great\nAre have an overnight instantaneous global uh explanation for why the market went down age and thirty two points in one day it's orange futures or are there that will tell you something other I control your money a whole host of that yeah they come up with a whole host of reasons why\nThey have had to fight yeah and and then you've got companies\nLike for instance uh you know chases laying off some of their a mortgage people and Ford is talking about are laying off a whole bunch of workers and it's later on\nUh what Ford blames it on the president's tariffs and it could be it could be the president's\nTerrorists but why is a wire the president's tariffs impacting Chrysler or General Motors is it just possible that Ford's got problems that aren't\nRelated exactly who the terrorists but this is a it's a good excuse to go to ... it was a good time to do it right you can either that or they're\n... as opposed to on of course they're proud of hey you\nKnow we've got these tariffs it took a time that we need to lay out some people and its cover a\nAnd it puts some heat on the administration because of the ... certainly aren't helping and the question about\nThat so I ... and in terms of uh\nYou know chase laying off some mortgage people will as a whole bunch of reasons why companies could be laying off mortgage people including the market being overheated and finally a capping and then there's also a whole bunch of different ways that people buy houses today\nAnd uh you know there's a lot of different services that are\nThat maybe the old school way of uh having hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people working in that division with ... by the way if they lay off four hundred people\nThere's I'm my going to guess that there's still hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who were doing that work at chase so I I don't know ... everything could be exactly as it was just reported to us\nBut we've seen so many of these remember a ... we've had a plunge like this what back in February\nAnd then nobody remembers it because within a matter of days literally everything that was last was back a gas so and and then went back up yeah you can't\nLook at this stuff day to day you just make you crazy if you're in if you're a day trader may be but if you are happy retirement account not only about ... about ten years from now right\nWell ... and above and beyond that I just don't understand and this is why uh whenever I'm at the gym and they've always got to CNBC on and they've got a guy I Can't look at that said well I I I I ...\nThat's on numbers on the side and the stuff on the Thai catch any as\nThe boxes of talking heads and here's the thing that those people who are on those financial shows are as a professionally wrong\nAs often as all the people on CNN whether models knows whether people have a much better record\nFor ... and they're almost every day to they're not they are today they hit this storm exactly on the head they predicted this big storm to the tea this one of the rain we were supposed to get on the big story when I was going

or someone else's driving\nAnd apparently the judge they're both fixed income retirement disability payments they live on Fifteen hundred fourteen dollars a month\nExplained the situation the judge the judge in his infinite kindness reduced to find a six hundred dollars a year and now the courts have said no no no you can't you have you you can't do that you can suspend people's licenses because you find them so much\nOn the surface this seems like another one of these stories where we're just basically letting you know law violators off the hook\nBut on the other hand I I've long believed and we saw this going back to when Jay Bieber are Palin safer streets LA was fighting the red light cameras and we were mailing out five hundred dollar\nTickets to people that we've you know traffic

and gentlemen this is the time we set aside for a couple of stories that are pretty good because there's so much bad news that you're\nFed all day long it's important to remember that not everything that's going on in the world as awful as some amazing things happening how about this in California the death rate from lung cancer is twenty eight percent lower\nOur early adoption of tobacco control efforts in California led to fewer people ever smoking reduce the amount used by those who do smoke and help smokers quit at a younger age when their risk of developing lung cancer as low as as a result\nThe authors of a new study published a in cancer prevention research a lung cancer deaths are twenty eight percent lower and California compared to the rest of the country and the gap is widening each year by almost a percentage point that's interesting\nIs number one like you said smoking is down but also this is a heavy pot smoking state so maybe that doesn't affect your lungs as ... well it does\nAnd I suspect that you may start to see that ... we may see some backsliding because of that and in the introduction of vaping in some of these other issues\nBut you know while recreation has been legal for two years by medical marijuana has been widely available in California for one so I think we'd be seeing that stuff well yes and no\nI I mean again ... ... you know even the medical marijuana as as widespread as did appear to be it's not the same as when you say something is simply legal when it's a legal product there were still plenty of people who weren't going to go to a doctor and get some phone you know like you had so that you could go buy a medical marijuana\nMike Lancome is legitimate was the bell\nThe bell flee anyway is it so but it's it's wonderful story and and it's fascinating and I am fashion limit and storyteller because again we were able to change\nThe cultures thinking on smoking dramatically as through a public service announcements government warnings\nHigher taxes on smoking products tobacco products lack\nCrazy alone there's ... running all the time of news that horrific surgeries and they're physically deformed do you see them all the time and the woman with the whole Internet right all that stuff\nAnd just making it inconvenient by limiting where you can smoke and people just threw in the towel and say can finally gave up yet it's not working for drug consumption and it's not working for obesity issues but it's certainly working on smoking around cancer\nA there are a amazing I knew a color changing contact

diagnostic tool and this is one of the stranger stories but Stuart cards and apps already help retail businesses collect customer data Walmart would like to know\nWhat you're feeling when you're inside its stores is come up with a way to do that Wal Mart recently submitted a patent application detailing a design for a sensor Laden shopping cart that can track of customers heart rate temperature how tightly they're gripping the carts handle it\nData and like ... read it which the card is being pushed and it has lifesaving potential believe it or not like when you see is that a Randy like speeding towards the donut yeah when Randy is going down the uh you know the ... and gets to elevated\nWell you can only go so fast in rascal remember that\nA fascinating though it's like literally they want to know everything about\nSmart 'cause I've been at a Wal Mart assignment too and there's a lot of people that look like they have this close to a heart attack\nWell wouldn't it be interesting if the good say uh you know spill on line in Iowa for but it's not a spell what are they going\nTo do with that information make like you know double the the ... the Iowa because they know that people like get the sweats and they they try to get there faster so it's like ooh let's double the amount of Doritos we have and the powder doughnuts\nWhile they like that and we are definitely do it for marketing but data from the courage could also be used to help quickly pinpoint potentially dangerous customer behavior if say the system suddenly detects a cart hurdling all along I all

this is such a confusing a bizarre story to say the least\nA walk us through what the politics are the what is it that a Mr ... who's missing what did he write how did he become a persona non grata in his own country\nSure you know it absolutely is a bizarre story\nA little clarity surrounding the details the journalist in question his name is Jim and ... and he was a well known critic of the Saudi Government and the royal family the ironic thing or the funny thing is that he was also actually a consummate insider he used to be\nA an advisor for the royal family at one point so this is a man who was not a long time dissident or a longtime critic he came to the U.S last September when into self imposed exile in Washington I'm\nAnd began writing for the Washington Post says a columnist he fled Saudi Arabia I'm Out\nOf out of fears for his own security because last September Saudi Arabia began a crackdown on dissent that we had since seen three waves of arrest\nStemming from someone has shown he fled the country that wave of arrest was focusing on writers and clerics in September twenty Seventeen in November twenty Seventeen\nUm authorities arrested several royals and prominent businessmen and detained them and there were\nCarlton hotel in Riyadh for months and then this may we saw another wave of that a detention\nWave against rights activists\nAnd what happened is very bizarre story that his show he went into the\nSaudi consulate in Istanbul it was over paperwork matter he needed to get some papers so he could get married to his Turkish fiance later this week or last week excuse me and he never left the facility which prompted his fiance to get in touch with Turkish authorities\nThe Saudis maintain that show you left the consulate but the Turks last Saturday allege that he was actually killed inside the constant led by Fifteen numbers Saudi squad that they allege was sent to the consulate specifically for this mission even alleging that\nAs you mentioned a show you may have been December it and his body parts taken back to Saudi Arabia now\nHave the target evidence yeah that is one of the has the Turks offered any supporting evidence for the for that the allegation\nNo they've yet to release any hard evidence backing up that claim yesterday they did release a video but it was highly edited video showing CCTV footage of shaggy walking into the ... but also showed the arrival and departure of black\nAdvance to the kinds of lead to and from the conflict that the Turks allege where part of this operation and the video also showed to pray the gulfstream jets on the tarmac at Istanbul's airport and the Turks again allege that these jets were the ones that carried the Fifteen member squad to and from turkey\nIs it possible to fly private jets Gulf streams into the airport in Turkey and uh in his ... uh and then just to park without having to go through any kind of customs inspection\nThat's\nWhere the the the lack of clarity comes in rights are presumably there ought to be um at a CCTV still showing them going through passport control there ought to be a list of the names that came in and again through passport controls and Turkish media have\nReleased a list of Fifteen names that they claim where the the agents and uh on these jets to be part of this operation they've also released images still images of some of these\nAgents and clearing has hurt control but the thing is that it's\nA very difficult to fully trust what Turkish media is saying since most of it is government controlled and here we get into the geopolitics a little bit because turkey and Saudi Arabia are political rivals so it's the evidence the Turks have released\nIt doesn't fully stack up to the claims that they've made but then on the other side as well\nThe Saudis they've maintained to their line that um that they've held the line that her she'll get left\nThe kind of lead but they have yet to release any footage or images showing that\nWe're talking with Marsha or go to the buyer who is a the a senior research analyst with the foundation for defense of democracies a voucher talk talk to us about the relationship between Saudi Arabia turkey Turkey's a Muslim country and so as a Saudi Arabia obviously\nA both are uh are technically allies of the United states will do or Iran has certainly moved turkey further away from the U.S and Saudi Arabia while an hour the United states has the dubious wanna best certainly not an eternal friend of the United states as George W infamously called them\nBut ah what is the nature of the relationship and is there a possible motive for ... and the Turkish government to be playing politics with the situation\nThe crux of the disagreement between turkey and Saudi Arabia rests on turkey support for the Muslim Brotherhood and turkey support for cutter last um last June Saudi Arabia along with three other Gulf countries in Egypt\nBegan a blockade of\nA cutter stemming from ... disagreements and differences they accused Qatar of funding terrorism providing support to the Brotherhood I'm amongst a whole other a laundry list of things\nAnd turkey since that time has become much more vocal partner to cut her cutter is the first country to step up and offer turkey economic aid these past few weeks when we saw the tricky we're a crisis\nThis is the heart of the the disagreement between turkey and Saudi Arabia but that said these two states are usually careful about not publicizing their stats\nUm their disagreements exist but they usually try to shy away from any sort of news making a\nHeadline making publicly uh traceable stats\nAs regards the question of whether there's political motivations for air to want to use this information that again is one of the reasons this story is so bizarre and so totally lacking and clarity because\nAfter the Turks made this bombshell allegation last last Saturday that showed you may have been killed and then dismembered\nUm air to want to appear to be walking back those statements earlier this week saying that we don't know what's happening\nCalling up on the Saudis to release evidence but not corroborating what a Turkish government controlled media had been saying and there's likely a little bit of of incentive for turkey at the very least to walk back some of these statements if if the Turks and know that\nThey can gain political concessions or any form of concessions really from Saudi Arabia in return for de escalating rhetoric\nAnd now the United states is putting some pressure any way on Saudi Arabia to uh come clean on this but uh it seems to me if the if the details that we've been offered by the Turks are true that\nThese two Gulf Stream sly and Fifteen guys show up in black town cars are SUVs\nA and a ... square away either a living journalist or a dismembered journalists there's gotta be some physical evidence within the embassy and there's got to be somebody held accountable for this because it's just an outrageous a full frontal assault on a free press et cetera et cetera\nAnd it's going to be something that's very hard for them or any American president to just a ignore a given our relationship and the fact that we essentially keep Saudi Arabia functioning it's the it's all backed with the United states military backing\nA so there's going to be a big move in Congress to suspend arms sales et cetera et cetera it's going to be quite a story to watch a Marshall thank you for coming on with us we appreciate your insights into this we could use all how
