been arrested many times they started\nYou know you make a really good point George because there are a lot of challenges for buyers out there there are many homes for sale and prices are on the rise and so our mortgage interest rates so the buyers who are putting their signature on offers must be really determined to get a house\nYou're absolutely right I based on on the latest closed sales figures which when released this fast\nBecause obviously sales are declining to go to a point a lot of that was driven by shortage of inventory the head when as you clearly stated come from prices which in September ... up a four point two percent year over here a mortgage rates which are practically at five percent\nAnd worth reminding listeners that if if the basis point increase of four point five to five percent mortgage rate doesn't sound like much but\nIt translates to about a hundred and twenty five to a hundred and thirty extra dollars a month to a to a mortgage payment which for a lot of buyers\nIs a significant increase so with all this to find the buyers are still active in the market and indeed put pen to paper a proverbial or or or digital and during September\nThat the bars remained determined to ah to look at at the home buying as a valid housing options\nAbsolutely and George as you said the biggest challenge of all is the lack of homes for sale but we understand there are signs that there are more homes coming on the market can you tell us about that\nShow looking at a home a permit so building permits and new home construction we've seen an increase in that activity even though a lot of builders are themselves facing headwinds both in terms of of um labor costs so\nThere are contending with a shortage of labor\nAlso materials cough cough the timber cost of a lot of of input into the construction process but we've seen an increase in that during the day here my only concern and going into the the colder months traditionally has been with winter weather construction tends to slow down in the ... the northern half of the country\nInteresting so George as you said earlier the different parts of America were wildly different in the pending home sales report can you tell us about that\nCertainly so while nationally were up half a percentage point into the picture was was quite different so the west a lead the pack would a four point five percent increase and the uh index of of contract findings\nUm which indicated that this region um despite um high prices still sees a lot of ... interest on a daily basis he was down seven point four percent\nUm however obviously the region is one worth watching because it ... it's basically the area where we're seeing the highest home prices on where Janet expectations are work on the the the biggest impact from increasing mortgage rates and prices\nThe mid West was also um a showing good results up one point to present from the prior month\nIn the meantime the northeast down zero point four percent of the south down one point four percent from August it's worth remembering that in the south we obviously had Hurricane Florence this here uh which impacted the Carolinas we also had Hurricane Irma\nLast year um which it shows\nA little bit so the year over year for the south or seeing a three point three percent increase which showed that even with a strong impact of Hurricane Florence was nothing like that left in the wake of Hurricane Irma so\nOr the south obviously while down a monthly basis still looks much better than it did a year ago\nI see well George many times you've been on the show this year and we've talked about a decline in pending home sales and even though the increase this time was just half a percentage point up is up\nYou're absolutely right that and it's worth pointing that out because there's a lot of concern a broadly speaking and and the economy about the impact on housing or from some of the factors we touched upon in our conversation\nThey including being that a lot of consumers are getting up and the truth is that\nWe have a strong employment we have a wages which even want adjusted for inflation are beginning to take up enough that the fed is concerned about inflation so with this as as a background it it's worth noting that consumers still remain very much interested in purchasing a home which\nBroadly speaking still a means that for the remainder of the year we can expect a healthy market\nExcellent well George I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about the latest pending

our national show scary thing our annual treat for you\nAs we observe Halloween all throughout today's show we're looking at things that terrified people when it comes to real estate but we're here to tell you that once you understand them those things aren't scary at all in right now here's a really big one the down payment\nThe idea of coming up with twenty percent for a house\nSince some people running for cover but let's take a closer look at that because that down payment might be less than you think and you might have help getting\nLet's talk about all of that now with the pro joining us Rob ... with the organization down payment resource Rob launched a down payment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties were hard to find downpayment programs Rob welcome to real estate today\nThat gets David it's great to be with you again\nWe are so glad you're here so Rob let's begin with your organization down payment resource a state by state guide to programs that are out there to help homebuyers come up with the down payment can you tell us about that\nSure okay that resource is a database of programs across the country over twenty five hundred programs to help people whether it's with down aim at closing cost and other ways to make a home more affordable\nRob I understand that you have some new research to share with us today about two days potential homebuyers\nThe Urban Institute has released it barriers to homeownership report that found Twenty one million people under the age of forty are ready and able to get a mortgage can you tell us about that new research\nYeah it's very exciting saving ... ... that's too that's just a great job and were were pleased to a partner for the second year in a row teamed up with brave act to support this study these Twenty one million renters\nUnder forty years of age our mortgage ready but what's even more compelling is that about eighty eight percent of those are roughly Eighteen million are only mortgage ready\nBut they have the income to afford a median price home where they live but Eighteen million people are getting ready and can't have the income to buy a home\nIn their area and you know when you think of that that's three times as many homes are sold every year that's a lot of people\nThat is a lot of people and so Rob what does the data say about why they're not going forward with home purchase\nA single word Steven is this perception that with a down payment is always the most challenging part getting home ownership in this case the data tells a story and the story is that\nBecause of ranchers misperceptions about how much they need for a down payment\nThey actually are making it worse than it is for example this research shows that about sixty five percent of these ... I\nThink that they need at least Fifteen Percent or more down at this report also showed that made the down payment for\nFirst time homebuyer is five percent so right there you can see there's a big gap between what people think and what reality is\nIf you could tell potential homebuyers across the country the truth about down payments what would it be Rob\nDon't give up on homeownership just yet\nThere is help out there and you might find thanking existing or sat down and you can get in for an average five that's that really a ... day long three at ... percent\nRight there you may be ready to buy 'em ... thought your work and you can get into a home for as little as three percent down conventional loans through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\nThat is awesome Rob and so the thing that you bring to the table that is so valuable to homebuyers all across the country is that wherever you live in America chances are\nThere's a down payment assistance program right in your area and people don't know about and that's the down payment resource does he tells people look here and you might find money for your down payment\nIf they're eligible for one program we say that most of those potential buyers are eligible for somewhere between six to eight programs and an average down payment benefit of those programs that by the two hundred dollars\nNinety two hundred dollars money that's just sitting there waiting to go their way but they don't even know about it\nThat's right ... we still have a lot more to talk about would you be able to join us again and the next hour a real estate today yes definitely thanks Rob talk to you then rub crane with down payment resource connecting eligible homebuyers an eligible properties with hard to find a down payment programs

night\nBut when you know the facts most of the time\nIt's not so frightening after all\nTalk about something scary back when real estate today first launched we were right in the middle of the economic downturn whether they suffered a foreclosure or they were forced into a short sale for many people the most frightening real estate nightmare of all came true they lost their houses\nMillions of families had to pack up and leave they had to rent or live with\nAnd they had to explain to their children that the family had to move it was a heartbreaking time not just for real estate but for all of America\nAs we all know things are better now much better the rate of foreclosure is tiny now compared to bend the economy is stronger more people have jobs good jobs real estate values have rebounded almost everywhere in once again\nWe're finally in a good place but even so I wanted to talk to you if for some reason you are in trouble and still at risk of losing your home\nBecause even though the flood of foreclosures has passed some people still need help they need information and they need to know their options [noise]\nFirst of all if you're having trouble making your mortgage payments talk to your lender right away they might be able to modify your loans so that your payments are lower every month\nOr they might allow forbearance in which they give you permission to skip a few payments while you get back on your feet later on those payments are added at the back end of your loan\nNow the worst thing you can do is nothing\nCalling your lender is really important because they might be able to help if not you can always try another lender but again don't just stay in your house worrying and doing nothing\nNow if you don't get anywhere with your lender go on line to the federal housing Finance Agency they have two programs you should know about once called harp the housing affordable refinance program that can allow homeowners to refinance even if they owe more than their home is worth\nGo online and check it out now it does have rules for instance you need to be current on your mortgage payments but give it a look and see if it might help you\nThe other is the principal reduction modification program also at the federal housing Finance Agency now that's new and in some cases of allows your vote him out to be reduced so you own less and your payments will be less also every month\nThe program is actually designed for people who are behind on their mortgages so it's only for those who are in the most desperate circumstances but if that's you this could be just to help you need\nAgain it's the principal reduction modification program you can find it on line at the federal housing Finance Agency\nNow also get in touch with your local and state governments ever since the crash many of them have created helpful programs for people who are having trouble holding on to their homes find out what might be available in your area and whether you might qualify\nYou see keeping people in their homes is really important it keeps neighborhoods strong keeps the kids in school and keeps families on the right track so there's a lot of help available out there\nAgain the housing crisis is now over and done with for most people but that doesn't mean everybody and even if there's one family out there who needs help maybe yours\nYou should know that help is available and here in real estate today you can count on us to give you all the information we can every week to help make real estate\nA good thing and never a scary thing [noise]\nIf you'd

today Steven back to you thanks belt [noise]\nResearch for you today about who might be working your open house because if your agent is not available that Sunday the open house might be run by a member\nOf their team real estate teams are a big part of the industry in which agents band together to serve their clients better and grow their business faster\nLet's talk about the latest research on real estate teams from and they are two thousand Eighteen teams survey joining us now is Jessica ... director of demographics and behavioral insights at the national association of realtors Jessica welcome to real estate today\nAnd thank you for having me\nWe're so glad you're here so Jessica according to the new survey roughly one quarter of the real towards you talked to are on a team tell us about that\nYet fairly and we look for people out there working meaning on each other experts and the industry and they can more easily and\nThat is wonderful you know back when I was a realtor I was actually on a team and I learned\nSometimes a very successful agent\nWill be so busy they have to literally turn away business and so they started changing and also you have a newbie agent who's just getting going and they don't have any business happening and they get on a team\nFrom either side the experience or the inexperienced it can be a great way to get going\nThat makes a lot of sense and it's probably more effective for the client that way as well I they're getting the ... service from their real estate team as opposed to reaching out to someone who really doesn't have time to take them even though they have a great reputation I in the field and they really want to work without each\nAbsolutely so let's take a good look at real estate teams across America according to your survey most team members are fully licensed real estate agents right\nThey are and we do you find that most team members hold a license so some may work if they're not licensed perhaps as an assistant or a virtual offend me do you see the use of that as well\nYou know that's really important because at one point you know someone has an office manager or something and they are on the team they would not be able to do real estate with the senior members of the team so it's important to be licensed\nAbsolutely that means they can take on all of that ... that are necessary rather than doing one thing\nAnd this was interesting in your survey Jessica virtual assistant tell us about that\nRight so we actually found that as there is a growth and virtual office his Latino from the profile of real estate firm you've actually seen the use of virtual assistance crying as well so looking at ways where you don't have to have a brick and mortar office\nWhere you can just have one password perhaps it's almost like a contractor being able to you know being on not per cent on a regular basis\nAnd so Jessica if I'm On a real estate team somewhere in the country what do I tend to do most as far as my weekly activities go so\nWe actually do see that most are agents summer broker's license on the team but we do see that other people in marketing and ministry enough cash transaction coordinator so there's a full range of activities that people are doing\nThis is so interesting Jessica and the other thing that I found was fascinating is that even among people who do real estate across the country who are not on a team many of them have thought about it\nAbsolutely is so if they happened to one today they've either been on a team in the past or they're thinking about doing so in the future it is a ... wage actually conduct business so it may be something where they can save time where they can be more productive and really grow their business\nSo Jessica as time passes are more or less real estate professionals getting involved with the team\nWe have seen from other surveys that we've found that this is a growing factor it's not something that we've asked the same way it to the same audience is so I it's not an apples to apples comparison but it does seem to be a growing wave for people to lean on the team join a team in ... that way\nThat is so interesting so Jessica was there anything in and they are two thousand Eighteen teams survey that surprised you\nI think it's just you know it's a growing factor and we're going to learn more about it as time goes on but we are seeing that\nPeople are joining them and it does seem to be a very productive way for people to enter the real estate business which we know there's a lot of new trade but also perhaps seasoned veterans can take a step back maybe actually take a vacation and rely on their team members as well\nYou know that's very true again back when I was on a team in real estate I remember I could be on the beach and my team member would call and say hey you just made a sale [laughter]\n[laughter] I think that maybe everyone's ideal but maybe not practical well\nJessica again thanks for joining us on

to being on TALK radio seven Ninety KABC\n[noise]\nReal estate today because you loud real estate [noise]\nAnd we are back with our special show scary things we wanted to wrap up this hour show with a question one that you might not hear a lot and that question\nIs do you live in a haunted house yes no maybe now the official term for a so called haunted house is stigmatized property it's a real estate term that\nMeans even though there may not be anything physically wrong with the property well for some reason there may be something emotionally wrong with it like if it's allegedly haunted no way would you ever\nBeen to a haunted house now usually the term stigmatized property applies to terrible events like murders or suicides but it can apply to ghosts as well\nNow you think we're making this up check this out back in the nineties a homeowner in upstate New York lived in what she called a haunted house in fact the hundred year old Victorian home was known far and wide as just that\nThe haunted house everyone in town called at that and in fact it was even on a bus tour of famous haunted houses okay\nThe seller was pretty proud of the fact she lived with ghost according to the local newspaper the Nyack news and views she reported ghostly footsteps doors slamming and shaking beds so one day the seller decides to put the house on the market and sure enough\nSomeone makes an offer put down a big deposit and prepares for settlement\nAnd up to that point the seller had never mentioned the place was haunted\nAnd the ... they had no clue until that is they were chatting with some folks in town about how they would soon be neighbors and just about everyone they met said oh\nYou're buying the haunted house well the buyers did not want to buy a haunted house so they filed a lawsuit to kill the deal and get their money back\nIn the first round they lost the court said in effect buyer beware but on the appeal they won the New York Supreme Court ruled they could kill the deal and get their money back\nSo there you have it a real case involving ghosts buyers and sellers but what's this mean to you\nWell in most places the law does not require a cellar to disclose their property is haunted\nThe northern Virginia association of realtors says ghosts suicide or alien abductions are defined as non material under state law and agents are advised to avoid discussing non material facts that stigmatize the property\nBut others aren't so sure the website legal zoom boats to disclose if the houses on it as they put it quote\nSellers should be up front about their homes\nParanormal gas or ghoulish histories as we saw in New York state if you have an alleged haunted house and you do not disclose it you could be sued by the buyers and you might lose not because of the court necessarily believes in goes but because the rumor that the places haunted\nCould hurt it's market value\nAnd if the places worth less because of those rumors well that's not smoke and mirrors that's real money\nAnd that's reason enough for someone to file a lawsuit so obviously the whole issue of haunted houses and disclosures raises more questions than answers first of all do you believe in ghosts and next is your place haunted\nAnd if you do believe and if it is hard to then you'll have to decide yourself whether to disclose that when you sell to place\nAre advice well you always want to follow the letter of the law but if you ever find yourself selling a haunted house you might want to also follow the spirit of goodwill [noise]\nComing up next week unrealistic

he went down to fifty seven percent in in Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty\nOr at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or eight Seventy five\nAnd a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... the show that is chock full of great in though right and so most sheltered just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to\nOf course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week and normally that's you know that\nPart of the shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're gonna talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they wanted tax gifts and college in most cases is more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a we think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen\nWell let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to yourself signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out\nAnd are those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't and the market to rebound quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I was very feeling that want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline\nOf and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers it looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us and we're close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong them right\nOr it's right anyway whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired are retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is a market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I changed my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we could see the market go down to another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here\nAnd are you going to stay in for that you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay I don't want you to get caught in this\nAnd so here's what you do you go to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd click on a

retired are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd ah that's a thing we're proud of but without our clients we boards probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go as well kiss\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring\nSoon I invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and\nWhen you're there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind\nAbout Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff well this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that\nSo here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five refrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he apply for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escapes twenty Fifteen Years okay so if he applies now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about six months that age eighty um with all the delay credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah OK soak in a ... it's kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed\nYou can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re filed okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss aid form five Twenty one\nSo so ... if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they've paid you and then re filed later alright\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nWe had this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we had seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you

for the last twenty\nMarvelous wonderful and very exciting years at all the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients and that we are affirmed that specializes in retirement planning so we primarily worked with people that are over the age of fifty who I retired or who are retiring soon\nAnd do we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states and we are honored and blessed by that and Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors and this is now for the second time [noise]\n\nAnd uh you know thank you jak for that a little Tempe there but you know what without ... without our clients we would be no are so clients listening right now and those of you who are not listening we we adore our clients and that we are so grateful and in fact you know I Want to share it with you something and and when asked you ladies and gentlemen I'm\nOver ... since October the AIDS you know you may have noticed that uh the market has been very volatile\nIn fact I'm that first week October the ... the ... the\nDow went down Thirteen hundred points that we remember the eight hundred point drop day and then it followed up with more and more and we've been down pretty much every week since then and us over the last three weeks the market has gone down quite a bit and my question to you would be\nAnd all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states doing very on\nBeyond and you know what buses right we want to help more people\nDo their retirement planning than anyone else that is our goal and uh so um because of that we primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon and if that as you then we would love to meet you and work with you\nAnd a ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on them I give it to my client well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you get anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year okay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year\nI Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak then you play it I Know I\n\nWould always say you you\nKnow my saga may be an\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed it take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nA is a Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the\nOf estate taxes this is a tax upon your death then it goes to whoever um and they wanted attacks so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax it happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to get it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid\nSo they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realize that if you tax\nEvery single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can get to\nAnd as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that too many people as you wish um\nAnd that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd and by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as the estate tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child\nThen that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore it doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott\nAnd his parents were giving him the money to sensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing\nHe wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember that bury the was that guy's name Barry something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway as I mentioned\nWe are from that uh we uh we ... we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon and so that is you then we want to work with you and so if you go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net is our website\nAnd when you're there you have a lot of options one is you can get my market alert email which I send out weekly and uh you can get that so that to you know if we decide it's time to get out of the market or whatever you'll ... will be a a telling you that as

Evans in Frank\nRoll R B as in boy oh for Beau dot\nCom go there seemed to have a little patch good for you do that little trick I told you what the painters tape because that's going to make the difference\nOkay so I I'm again I put down the painters tape\nAround around the finished floor so that all you see is the little gap that you have a little kid and you mix this little patch get together and you put it in there with a knife and you kind of draw to cross they're like you're filling that\nAnd you get it nice and smooth and then you let that dry peel up the tape and don't look down\nOld so it's something like ... like peanut well we tried\n... years ago listening for quite a while and the more I\nDidn't understand that the little ...\nThat well I mean well I guess my question to you a Irene is how long it'll be in this house\nAbout another year or two\nOkay and are we going to then then we're going to sell it yeah OK and does the house\nNeed a lot of other work or the or or you know what I mean when you take a look at your house and you're like boy you know I look at this neighborhood I mean you need a lot of other workers other stuff updated\nMm yeah that no the rest of them that I got maybe on the ceiling a dry wall where the where they go in with a meat kitchens updated and stuff like that or no\nNo right like I get my point is that is that when you go to sell in a year\nYou know that floor is going to be an issue when you go to sell you know what I mean\nThey're going to look at that and go why new new floor and they need a new this and that now if there's a lot of other things that your house needs new then I wouldn't spend a lot of money invested in it if the timeline as a year but if the other things you look and say okay this is pretty good you may want to consider putting on a new floor\nOkay\nAnd something you could do that would look really nice and would be relatively affordable would be some type of luxury vinyl pile\nAnd it's beautiful lethal yeah okay All right yeah it comes to the plane 'cause I think\nIt does and it's one hundred percent waterproof you can go right over what you have right there to look really nice it won't separate\nAnd it'll really kind of changed the look of the whole place but again you got to really kind of plan that out about the money I Want to invest you're not going to get none of us if you go and spend you know I'm just going through a number out there two thousand dollars right three thousand dollars and you have something to do this\nYou're not going to get that word money dollar for dollar in a year but it will be the type of thing that may help sell the house\nAnd ... ... ... or why\nI'm Still passing a it'll get by\nIt'll get by it'll it'll it'll buy you some time it'll

know\nHow do people do that like who I'm curious about that who is the one that sets up the national guard a mean like in other words ... ... is there like a committee that 'cause I Want to create my own thing like national you know stuff you're told day or something like that right\nYou you have any [laughter] no I actually I Do there is a committee and\nSomebody within the government keeps a national\nCalendar and you be anybody can apply for a national\nDay that's why you know today is probably national something day right a lot right exactly right yeah and we\nThought you know where we make doorbell or we're known for that we were launching a brand new one a Halloween is uh the day that most people are interacting with doorbell so we thought you know what let's go for national doorbell dead awkward thirty first\nYou know what I Would think it'd be a fun thing for you guys to do because you know eventually like what happens in our neighborhood we run out of candy we buy I don't know how many bags but we buy four hundred and fifty pieces of candy and we give each child one piece of candy and we run out stingy\nWe mean stingy I'd rather give the many something than like a handful of oh you look so good you are just jealous because we get four hundred and fifty people come into our door is to write it's amazing so then what inevitably happens come you know nine o'clock it's kind of you know getting dark\nThan we have to put a sign up that said sorry we're out of candy with the uh the new term knock maybe you can have a thing where like when they ding dong it sends a message saying sorry out of candy I guess you could do that technically right I can sit on the couch 'cause you can speak through the new tone knock right\nThat's right yeah anytime someone comes to your door or you can see them they can't see you but you can see them and you can carry on a conversation with them or you know if you're out of candy you can say sorry we ran out or even if ... if you want it to take the kids up and down the street and you just wanted to leave a ball out front you could watch and see\nThe news or taking more than one and say hey I signed put it in ... and\n... oh my gosh and you're on candid ... Iran\nNew tone camera wait a minute you leave a poll out last year we did and it was ... because ... David my husband and I both wanted to take our daughter is All right right right so we left temple and they said please leave some for all the children and you're not a lot and like I said we don't get that many trick or treaters oh I Know that one\nRight Lynn\nAll right now um the the thing with some of your competitors are Jeremy is that they're a battery operated systems that have no connection to your existing system but that's not true with a new tone knock right it it uses the existing wiring which also helps the power of the system\nThat's absolutely right when you install one of these uh what would you do is take off your existing push button and you've got to wires there\nThat's all you need you you attach the the not to those two wires uh you're you're homeless powering doctors no battery in it and the reason we did that is for a it's a bit of work better and extreme temperatures\nUm you know I live in in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and for about three weeks last year around Christmas we had negative double digit temperatures will knock is ready to go to negative twenty two\nAnd if you have a battery usually you can't go much below negative five and we hit that frequently and I know a lot of the country does as well ... it also works that the other way around if you live and really hot temperatures you're you're able to go to higher temperatures there as well\nBut people should know too is that doorbell or those wires are low voltage wires and so there's a wild certainly\nYou should turn off a breaker that may feed the transformer in your mechanical room somewhere\nBut you don't you know there's not a lot of a high energy coming through those wires so it's a it's a safer way for the do it yourself or to to do that but you also have pretty I'm a robust instructions and technical support as well correct\nAnything we can help you with the average just have a few minutes left in our show always helped me to\nA how to help you eight hundred how can you help me help me to have any ... you may have a cup of\nCoffee eight hundred to two two fifty two twenty two eight hundred to two to five to two two is our phone number or let's go to the phone lines right now and talk to Murray who is in San Bruno Murray urine house march radio good morning\nI'm Sorry I have a problem with my voice right now All right we'll take that time\nAnyway I just wanted to know let the website which would that doorbell\nOh sure it is that you have your pen or pencil reading yes All right it's triple W. dot new tone and new U.\nT. O. N. E. dot com and U. T. O. N. E. dot com\nThank you very much enjoy your program very\nMa you're very nice thank you very much thanks for calling us for any by the way we were talking about speaking span that lady called and the arts had someone called in and said you can find it at the dollar store the real speaking Spanish I did some research ... here on the how smart ... I Know it's a ... I mean it has been around forever\nAnd it's like not the knock off at its peak and\nOh my gosh we did a thing of the house where it's TV once you know we do these asked Lou I'm uh just like we do on the radio but I Do this in on their television show we send our microphones and cameras out and we asked people to ask questions and so it's like Hi I'm Lindsay from Oregon and I've got this question whatever\nAnd at one time it was something where I was giving the advice about using speaking spam\nAnd a producer that we had worked with what we do is we\nBecause of the questions get tape we know what they are in advance and so we were able to get props to show on the TV show and um I never knew that there was a liquid speaking Spanish\nLike in a spray bottle so it's you know clear bottle when it's orange because you know you speak and stay on the box or and and the and I made the joke of on the bottle it says smells like sunshine\nState that's far from yeah OK what a sun sunshine smell like I\nI don't know what I think yeah All right but what does sunshine smell like that are now exactly neither do I so how does it smell I have no idea I've never felt right but I mean it's like you know you you're like oh it smells great out here but you would never say that it smells like sunshine\nBut that's what it says on the spray bottle I don't think it says it on the powder speaking span which is my preferred a\nUse of speaking span but if you buy the Bible it says smell like sunshine if you tell me what that smells like I'd be really curious\nWell that's kind of marketing genius because I mean it's like well we all I Know it's like sunshine [noise]\nNow they know it's not like evidently eight and I don't want to go buy a bottle now there you go\nEight hundred to two two and sniff it away fifty to try to is our phone number I here's Charles in Granada hills Charles you're on how smarts rate of good morning\nOh great I have a question here I just finished remodeling a shop or and I have a flaw in is\nAnd I know it's working properly or thought when I take a shower it starts to flood out a until I put my toes there to create a like a funnel and it was right down all for a half an hour it doesn't really matter but that first initial it just wants to\nSlow it on top of the drain and it does it go down that stumped on me\nYou got a little you got a little air pocket that's occurring writes you when did you do this shot when did you do this or a ... hour you'd\nProbably about a month ago but uh like I said once I put my toe they're everything goes down beautifully for ever but if that first initial that it doesn't want to go down\nOkay how when you remodeled at the drain is is draining the concrete floor\nThat as a sub floor and I ran it's uh I I Believe that it was inch and a half two inch pipe running ... inch and a half ready to the old a bathtub\nAnd you have a tram you have a trap underneath there correct yes All right and it set and then the floor drain in this pebble drain does however it's square and you have a square screen there\nNo screen it's just a oil Rob square decorative with a pebble floor so it has a nice slope to it because I I heard that if you're doing that before he got to have a little more slow\nYeah yeah but wait where's the dream as the drain in the center or is it a is it a trough train\nIt it's a center 'cause I built it and tapered it put it all\nRight but the drain itself has a screen doesn't it\nNo yeah it it does I I you know the little square hole on top\nYeah yeah right exactly okay so here's what I Want you to try the ... or ... have you showered yet today no okay that a personal question Charles and I were to have you showered yet today are using the Irish Spring Charles I'm OK I Want you to pay the screen I\nTake the screen on screwed probably got two screws are holding that square screen in there yes pick the screen off take a shower and see what happens\nOkay you could be getting a little air pocket is occurring with the train the other thing too is you said it drains normally in the drains fine that there may be some sedimentary something caught in that trap\nUh-huh so what I Would try ... okay I'm going to back up a second [noise]\nTake a rag put it over the dream turned the shower around and get about an inch of water in there okay hold pulled the rag quickly and take a plunger and plunge it\nOK really give it a forced to see if there's something that a pie trap that you can push away then take a shower see what happens brings her driver in there while you're in there and your birthday suit\nAnd then if all of a sudden that pocket occurs take the take the screen off and see if by taking the screen off does the water go down you might just need a different whole pattern might create in the little vacuum based on where that is and the whole pattern could solve your problem\nOkay um I have one more question you have time to ... the shower that I put in as one of those big like a ten by ten rain showerheads a nice okay\nSo it did not have a screen on there so when I I\nWas so much water coming out which was awesome but it was too much for the drain so I put a ... a restrict or a little screen for\nI think it's a one gallon per minute or whatever and now it's horrible it's not all the little the little ... says the water comes out of right and even kids are all the water come out do they sell\nDifferent types of screen like two gallons per hour three\nI knew that they do know that that restrict or that you have to you might be able to just modify that yourself\nOkay I just went up a little holes\nThat Iraq correct in a wreck and I play around with that it should work out well Charles thanks so much for the phone call we'll all be thinking about you in the shower with a screwdriver\nNow we want now say white lie and why did I laugh at what if he looks\nLike a what's the guy from star is born what if he looks like Bradley Cooper

becomes a much more of a problem in very hot climates than it would be in colder climates\nYou kind of course supplement the edge and looking at American food uh and having done this for many many years and having tests\nThousands of people\nI Would say that everyone should supplement the ha that do cause the heck's Newark as it and that gives you two options won a vegetarian option we call it the ha two hundred which is a two hundred milligrams of omega three fatty acid\nOr from micro allergies so it's the clean is least likely to deliver in the kind of a toxin\nHere you could take maybe three or if you've been to fish in a long time maybe you'll take five for a few months and then cut back to three and our latest addition\nUm if da da da ... is from if fish oil without any molecular distillation or any weird things remaining we've been able to clean this oil\nAnd so if you are not a vegan you might consider this is a good option a teaspoon of the day is what we would recommend and this guy\nIs not only critical for great kidney health than just about every and when we do energetic has the on shows\nA shortfall for ... and so we know this is something everyone should be using and of course it's critical to the nervous system and the brain as well\nSo can we do more for getting the absolutely we've got a kidney support formula\nAnd this is a cause alive the stores and it'll target nutrition right to the kitten is so today we'll have ... to a hundred and or if da da da da and she'll and kidney support on special\nYou would buy two and get twenty five percent off each so they give a bus tour over the line and there'll be happy to help you eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven that's eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven\nAll right let's go right to the phones let's go to Irene in South Carolina there Irene yeah same here okay and how old the woman to you and how much do you weigh\nI'm a cure I weigh one ...\nOh okay well the first thing you want to know when you're pregnant is that you want to avoid any kind of chemical exposure and that's quite a trick when you look at our food because we've had an ever escalating amount\nOf persistent organic pollutants entering a food supply so\nWhat do we do about that well step number one when you eat your main meal you take a couple of capsules of something called dragon clans LAX\nAnd this is a calcium aluminum silly kick clay it never leaves your intestine and it'll trapped up to Ninety eight percent of all the weird pops that may be in your food and may have been cleared some of them from your body as well over time\nThat's step one step too if you really want the best healthiest kitten town\nYou've got to supplement with an in my opinion a vegetarian form of ... and maybe taking five of these at your main meal which hopefully could become lunch\nDoes it will be so much easier on you how far along are you in your pregnancy and\nKind of we write so these are minimum things now you're going to probably need iron and I'm very opposed to eating white flour during the period of the pregnancy because it's got rock forms of\nA buyer and and uh you don't want an iron supplement the spirits humor right that's junk if you do need iron we have a very gentle form of iron that's very low potency but usually can do the job of correct thing I'm low iron levels from the food that's what I Would\nRead that question I guess that's my first child I had not yet and um now I have not yet and I am I going to really want to take a vitamin but when I take in Lakewood farm accent makes me gag even more\nThough that's not what you need when you have the ... your ... your husband's wrong he gets an F the the nausea is induced by the spleen being able to make enough red cells for the demand of the fetus so what you need to go on to something called adrenal support\nAnd or at your ... at your body weight you need between six or eight capsules at breakfast that should within a day or to stop the nausea okay and you would do it\nBecause I have a history of like our batteries overlap I had a vitamin\nThat could be another issue because it's B. six\nThat keeps the um cholesterol and suspension in the ... so that's why if you go on gall bladder Fiji it contains that but that's a liquid with a little alcohol I wouldn't recommend that view I Would recommend that you take perhaps fifty milligrams of straight B six\nThan that I can take us a capsule and that should help that be nice to put you on gall bladder support but I I don't like the alcohol during the pregnancy\nNow diet wise this becomes a very big deal I think that the research now really supports shifting away from animal products shifting away from meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products and in particular shifting away from foods made with refined oils\nYou can get a free copy of the battlefield that go to the last page it's got a resource list watched some of the videos with your husband and I think you'll see the motivation to to shift and shift to the diet that's recommended where you can occasionally eat this or that\nI think you'll still need that occasional kick possibly if you used to read made of eating a little red meat so these are basic things there's much more that you can do uh I think once you get on the adrenal support\nOr your husband is right now you could probably take ... stress be okay and you would take maybe oh one teaspoon right\nMhm and I think you won't have any any any problem with it at all\nThis is a great beginning as more if you call the ... they've got more details for pregnancy and the things that are really important to tech okay now oh hold on this diet yeah you need them extras be because you're going to need more beat twelve\nAnd you could even get a separate v twelve and maybe take a half teaspoon of it to make sure if you go strict vegan that you have the twelve 'cause that's a real problem if you don't do that okay\nThey can't um when I ... I saw it up anyway so I I feel like I could come\n[laughter] yeah it's called the forced march I understand completely OK okay take them by them All right let's go right back to the phones let's go to Audrey in San jose and she's got a dad who's\nBone on bone in the right hip supposedly are you there Audrey\nYes I Am how old your dad and how much does he way\nSeventy five years old any land line\nOkay well here's what you need to know Audrey that half the time when they say that it's not true and I'm the there's an underlying issue even if let's just assume for a minute it's true and they want to do a hip replacement\nThe process that caused him to lose the bone is an changed\nSo why would we think that a trauma like a hip replacement whatever he'll\nSee this is some kind of lunatics thinking that we have that's very scary to me so the\nFirst thing you need to do for your dad is to get a roll of ph paper and by the way of you do this or Audrey of ...\nUh she's thirty four way one forty years and then that should get paid and it's you get a ... like than she ah she get bloated and she just she has to be an end in a pill\nAnd I guess well\nFirst thing you want to do obviously she's not very overweight how tall the woman is she\nShe's like three\nThrees so she's got maybe twenty pounds she's got to get rid of rent that she feels over way okay well normally the easiest thing to do is go on a whole food plant based diet like the battlefield diet and I usually this is all you need to do\nBut in some cases it's a very stubborn you know we may need other support to get the way down and we have a number of agents that can help to promote your could toast is\nTo get to losing weight quickly one is adapt to a gym and here she would just take three at breakfast\nAnd the other one is or Arthur majestic blend here lean Quito of lamb\nAnd this guy features a green coffee beans and a number of other wonderful things to jump start and she would just take two of these at breakfast this would be to jumpstart dropped away when she starts the battlefield that\nShe would use low glycemic fruit in the morning that would mean blueberries blackberries strawberries something that she likes like that\nAnd try to make it a four hour two five hour fast whereas she doesn't eat other food until lunchtime this gives the body a chance to get in the fat burning mode now she gets to lunch\nShe now is gonna be eating three times as much storage and she used to eat with the old food the with the old that and now she'll have pro fused bowel movements and she'll find that it's way easier to digest the food so lunchtime might the beans and rice\nAnd ... and she can have plenty of but the rice and beans are made without oil is no refined oil that was key to really dropping the wait no refined oil and you've greatly restricted meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products\nOkay up like a really quick or she's also been in some ... factions\nYes maybe three to four times a year\nThose are very common with chicken\nDish out a lot of chicken a lot of chicken and that and got to go that's what probably is doing that fifty percent of the chicken or ... infected with these ah with the organisms that commercial chicken with the organisms that may induce that kind of problem in the urinary tract\nOkay they cheat organic chicken and egg the veteran no chicken legs oh no okay because\nEven the organic eighty seven percent is contaminated with salmonella oh wow so no so now let's talk about the acid reflux she's very young to have that so you want to make sure she's getting adequate salt\nShe can just go on a sauna break a sweat and taste the perspiration the upper part of the arm should taste slightly salty if that does she's home free then I Would question if she's got a big star like a hysterectomy or C section or are there any major scars on the center line of the body\nNow by she and she can't take the salt and her farm\nOkay she is not the forum it's we up there you're almost or you're just coming off the shoulder\nRight they're all coming up and I'm also okay I'll almost by muscle\n... it is it's you know that little round one at the very top it's the midpoint of that out there okay yeah you a check in the wrong spot and if there's no major scar then and she has adequate solved then you've got to give her digestive enzyme that's very young\nTo need that maybe she had some issues as a kid with anorexia or bulimia or if so then she may have damaged the stomach and then she would need at her body size one died just have started the meal\nAnd about two ... at the end of the meal OK okay thank you got high buddy take yeah I think it'll be very happy with what happened so I Can't get back to you but I'm\nAll right this is talk about Marshall pitch Davis's health plan live we're entering your questions let's go right back to the phones let's go to\nSusan in New York and she's got some irritation for testing says she thinks she might have some candy to are you there Susan yes Hi Hi and how old woman who you are and how much the way\nA line about a hundred and Ninety\nWell the first thing that you want to know\nOf course you're approaching the age where\nYou can't just hardly anything in a way of cooked food so obviously your first step\nTo reducing the irritation in the intestine is to make sure you can digest your food\nSo you would get on quantum died just maybe take a couple of those at the start of the meal\nThe end of the meal about for ten ... right\nNow you're digesting more like you did in your twenties and this shouldn't be any rotting food\nHitting the got now the next step we have to look at is certain foods are more irritating than others corn is one of those super irritated is so you'd want to get rid of corn and you'll want to add\nVitamin D three or we call it the three gold and maybe about six drops of this\nIn about one ounce of water\nAnd you would mix in that about four drops of Lima name now that's an essential oil of orange and it will\nMost if I the D threes so you mix it really good in the water and you see the big droplets of the three become tiny tiny now you know no matter what the state of your gall bladder you're going to absorb this this has been shown to promote\nThe best response to all of the known immune fractions two hundred plus immune fractions of body makes and it has been shown to be very helpful for all new coach\nSo this may be just the kind of thing that you need Susan to get back to track now it's possible if you're seeing candy to that you have a bug in the intestine and even doing these things you may still see some irritation\nIf that's true then you really need to visit with someone who's mastered\nClinical nutrition somebody who knows Q. R A quantum reflex analysis they're going to be able to test the ... and see if there's a bug or something else that needs to be attended to in the intestine and if you call the ... and they can give you the number of people\nUh hopefully somewhere near you in New York okay\nThank you what are your thoughts about fiber like brown rice green cards and the collapse job\nWell remember those little shooters you just got the big shooter which is vitamin D three now called us from is a standing immune system and if you get a good quality one that's got pre formed immuno glob villains\nAnd they're the guys that fight the battle first in the intestine\nSo yes a collage from may be a real help\nWhat else did you ask about\nNuclear nuclear times you can\nAlso the glue to mean of course is one of the foods for the bow lining but if we're going to go there the best way to go probably is to go with a fiber immune revenues go acting is the active ingredient and\nThis guy for meant to be a great food for the lining of the intestine so all along the intestine this is going to feed every cell there so if we think of the glue to mean I think this is a better way to go\nAnd you take just one as well as your body as it probably use two tablespoons\nYou can mix then and the smoothie if you want you could take it in the morning or afternoon that that would be my favorite but start with the basics so many people Dr Robert canal at UCLA is shown\nJust about everybody is vitamin D deficient and if that's the case you know you are you know trying to put uh some to ACT UP with a sledgehammer\nLet's go back to the basics and if the basics don't do it by all means you can always add the other Asia's okay\nThey get they create for starters and right\nNow ... with the linemen and digest NHL that's your start OK okay\nAnd then by the way my take your vitamins which I Love it takes a long time away from the\nWell the cause of the fact that it's a sort of a probiotic suspension you can take him anywhere but usually we recommend you take 'em half the breakfast earlier in the day because that's when you'll be able to use them the most\nOf it that I find it like out there and filed\nThat'll be fine that's even better if you if willing to do that [laughter]", "show_name": "McIntyre In the Morning", "station": "KABC", "day": "27", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
