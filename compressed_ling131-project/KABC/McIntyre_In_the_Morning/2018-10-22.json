tired I Do have my Robbins gear in the back of the closet so anyway ladies and gentleman so it's going to be socks versus the blue crew and obviously too powerful changed because of the week teams have gone home playing golf with the Mets\nAre the ending of that series was fantastic I mean when you when the Dodgers last game a six in Milwaukee on friday and I thought oh this could be really\nA and they got ... pretty good in game six they weren't really in it and the\nBrewers were and do or die mowed the Dodgers and game southern were do or die\nEverybody's do or die mode but being do or die when you're at home is better than being do or die when you're on the road and yet the Dodgers stepped up to the plate not only got a great start from Walker bealer\nBut the the defense of play of the post season\nWell actually they've been too because it's been a daddy for the red Sox made a catch in left field again that series against Houston but Chris Taylor's grab\nThe\nOf altering because the Dodgers were up at that moment or two to one if Taylor doesn't make that incredible playing left it's a it's a tie game and a and Milwaukee's got a runner possibly on third base\nMhm but definitely ... and the momentum just everything yeah so so instead of the Dodgers go back into the dugout still up\nTo one and then of course a quake hits three run home run I mean it's a complete series change your game changer or all of a sudden Dave Robert starts managing like Craig ... brings in Kelly Jansen\nOr early gets a to a innings of solid relief from and then ... come out for the ninth and finish it off which was the right move to make because\nHer show was throwing that's his day to you know pictures\nOr have their routine to get ready for the next start in the first thing you don't do anything your eyes she might stretch you might do some light jogging men the second day after a start you do some long toss in the outfield loose in the arm up massage et cetera et cetera on day three you\nDo a ... a little side so instead of just throwing the bullpen session going and throwing ending you know and that's it I Want to get out and look great to ha ha yeah anything solid\nAdjust to a tremendous a win for the Dodgers and they go back to the world series for the second year oh this is a very very hard to do the Kansas City royals did it in twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen they went back to back there last one to the giants they won one over the Mets\nBut to be a repeat just to get back to the world series is quite an accomplished but here's the problem for the Dodgers\nNobody will care if they don't win the world series because after Thirty years and after six division titles in a row if they don't win it they run the risk of becoming the Atlanta Braves who one year after year they won Thirteen consecutive National League\nEast is expected they were going to ride division yeah and the fans got bored they weren't even selling playoff games because the Senate just another playoff games like the Braves fans were just looking at our season ends and knocked some time in October they knew they were going to the playoffs every year\nSo at us and and out of those Thirteen titles a nationally gays titles they only won the world series once\nSo ah the Dodger fan says it wants to be enough for me as long as it's a two thousand Eighteen so uh the pressure is on both teams obviously it opens in Boston on Tuesday night returns to Los Angeles the games three four and hopefully five if we needed\nA on a Friday Saturday Sunday in Los Angeles and ticket prices are expensive let's get a quick phone call in here Michael's on the Ninety One freeway Michael you want to talk about that a migrant caravan heading towards the border\nWell I just wanted to point out that this morning on KTLA and they were showing those those immigrants and they were a laughing and smiling and most of them are young men uh there was a lady holding a very wealthy that baby\nSo I I Want to just take issue with uh your order saying downtrodden there obviously you know sponsored by somebody but I also wanted to say that about the Nineteen sixteen um thing uh Larry King at Fort receipt\nOh no [laughter] I'm Laurie was definitely very humid\nAnd they are laughing that's very kind\nOf yeah I was that was a mercy laugh by the way thank you caught [laughter]\nTo me if ever would you favor why don't you phone about seven hundred thousand of them to handle [laughter]\nFast or Larry King before the game from beyond the grave that a pre game thing for the Dodgers\nI saw that I heard it yeah it was a quick light like pre not dead no\nHologram Larry I Know is the actual Larry King I don't go on you know gifts game seven by the way who did not watch game seven of the dog the rovers Vince golly he was at I think you nervous no he was at a charity event downtown LA hustler he was getting updates and let me tell you something ... has watched

watch a game and Milwaukee sign All right ah ladies\nAnd gentlemen let's go check in a because this story about the murder of cars show which surprise surprise the Saudis are finally said oh yeah he went and he didn't come out but this whopper story that they've concocted sounds like\nA a story conference for like the worst episode of something on Netflix\nIs that a new one for an interview hopefully they had to buy like a guy that looked like him walking out with his clothes that he was actually wearing and walk out of the ... or ... and they don't know where his body oh because it's scattered over God Knows how many\nAh anyway when the guy just had a bone Fonda yeah didn't patterns so let's get the very latest from Linda Kenya and I'm Linda how are you\nDoing good morning how are you\nI'm find the real question is what is the U.S reaction going to be what as NATO's reaction going to be and the world reaction because\nUh obviously this took place on Turkish soil and this really also represents a the political friction between the Saudis and ... and the and the Turkish government\nYeah this entire situation is spiraling out of control at this as if this had been planned event which it appears that it was uh the you know they didn't expect this kind of backlash the Saudis\nAnd and it's really rippling throughout the international community Germany today said that they're going to stop arms sales\nAh I doubt Russia's gonna do the same but you never know [laughter] and that the u._s. just talking about is a very lucrative arms sales business they help with Saudi Arabia as leverage point maybe\nNot to cut it off completely but maybe to\nTo a parrot down I mean these are all issues that are being talked about in order to respond to this heinous a quarter of this Washington Post journalist\nWell you know the U.S has a look the other way on Saudi the Saudi government's atrocious behavior for about sixty five years have been going back to the Eisenhower administration\nAnd there were a whole bunch of reasons for that in real politic terms or as we've said many times or your choice you can be between awful an off color\nAnd because of the petroleum a recording requirements the vast petroleum reserves that Saudi Arabia has ended because they are a stabilizing influence from the U.S perspective in a very unstable part of the world\nWe are including a doing rendition for the U.S when we've got somebody that we want a rubber host and we can't do it because of our laws we let them do it so there's all kinds of dirty ops that go on a courtesy of the

people waiting for him and he got into a fist fight with Fifteen people and died in the fistfight it's just it's it's it it's\nIt's almost fate like a fable\nThat that you ... you can't even believe that this would be the the story that they would come up with a leak you know this is what the senators are saying that they just don't believe a word on and and then of course the cover up you know they have a man\nWho was apparently hired as a body doubles aware 'cause she'll disclosed to come out of the back door of the consulate and and it you know it's just it's it's very ...\nIt's strange

News\nLive in a local at seven o'clock this morning every one of ... a caravan of migrants from Central America has crossed from Guatemala and Mexico heading towards the U.S\nMost of the migrants marching toward the U.S are from Honduras including the Smith who says he just wants a fair shot\nAnd that's what Mexico has largely done one who came to illegal immigration and their country as long as you want to keep going to the U.S there were fine with it just keep moving if you're going to stay in Mexico that they had a problem with like most countries do\nBut uh this time apparently uh there were ten buses waiting for immigrants along the highway between a top ...\nI Can't pronounce words so it's probably good no wasn't my high school Spanish I think I just order to ...\nUh I got a shot to topple is your last night and had doll go ... and the drivers had been instructed to carry the migrants to shelters and the officers said it was unclear how many of the group were from the migrant caravan and how many were Mexicans who joined the march\nSo uh apparently from friday to Sunday one thousand twenty eight people requested asylum in Mexico now that's the process with the United states has a legal process for accepting a people who are seeking asylum for either economic asylum or for you know obviously ...\nWar or from a ... violent things ... sexual abuse at all kinds of things there's a process and it's a ... and people get accepted rejected\nOr anyone with a valid visas will be able to enter and move freely anyone who wants to be recognized as a refugee or as a beneficiary of complementary protection measures must do so individually those who do so will be held at a migratory station\nFor as many as forty five business days anyone who enters quote in an irregular manner will be rescued and subject to an administrative procedure and where appropriate will be returned to their country of origin and the safe and orderly manner\nThis is all what the Mexicans are saying\nNow the thing is ... I don't understand why there's even an argument about this there's a legal process for people to follow\nAnd if you follow the process then you're going to be subject to the rules of the process but this notion that somehow if large groups of people could just walk to the border I show up number they can just come on and we're supposed to just say oh okay well then hey well if that's the\nCase then [noise] fast forget the rules [noise] and I live\nOn is willing to work six months ago well and it's worked many times in the past and and the reality is what is the politics of this\nBecause there's some kind of politics behind this and I have no I I Know that every third me andme on the Internet says George Soros is paying people to do this and maybe that's true but what the I I don't know it's true I sang a little children I just know it's a mean well you'd pay the parents\n[noise]\nBut I mean it just seems like all of a sudden there's four thousand now some are saying it's grown five to possibly ten thousand as it's moving up more people are joining in thinking hey now that there's a big groups of people let's just let's go on up its opportunity but I mean for it that common almost arrive ride at our mid term elections\nI Can't I Know I have and here's the one person I Know I mean one person I Know one rich person I Know who has a motive to pay thousands of people show up at the border and demand that the U.S take a man and that's Donald Trump if I [laughter]\nLike if there is a rich guy who should be sponsoring thousands of immigrants who would be illegal immigrants if they just on the border right before the election the person would have the most to gain of ... from this is on her 'cause I got to tell you\nThere's no way in the world this helps the Democrats in the midterm election\nWell unless this goes the way it did over the summer when they start splitting up the families again\nWell there's that but hopefully they learned that lesson\nDon't do that because that's catastrophe ah but it absolutely the images of people showing up at the U.S border and just demanding that they be allowed in and that they be given jobs et cetera et cetera et cetera\nIt it it just highlights the the problem that we've had for decades and by the way this happens every day the numbers that we're talking about here the only thing that's unusual about it is that they're coming collectively in one big match because this happens in small groups all the time\nAnd that's not hyperbole that's a fact this happens every single day doesn't just happen to the Mexican border it happens imports and harbors and specifically airports where people fly in and they banished known goes looking for half a day every day every single day I've been talking about this for over Twenty years\nKind of sick of hearing it right well the problem hasn't gotten any better has it and it hasn't\nAnd this is something that Donald Trump for all of the rhetoric for all of the hand wringing for all of the editorializing and the protests et cetera et cetera\nUh it hasn't stopped during the uh first to close to two years of the Trump Administration is a really done anything he's spoken a lot about it and he's gotten people inflamed on the issue but the reality is when we talk to the border patrol people\nThe problem is just as big today as it was when Brock Obama was President George W. Bush was president going back to Bill Clinton's presidency\nAnd I know that he's got a house in the Senate but really he's kind of alone on this issue 'cause most of the Republicans in Congress don't\nCare well ... and I got to be honest with you I'm not sure what his level of commitment on the issue is because\nHe's given a lot of a rhetorical fire but ... and ... stone but when you get to that where the rubber meets the road he agreed to a budget deal that actually prohibits\nFunding for the construction of a border wall the one person has has ... the one person in his administration Hawaiian confident actually believes in the sovereignty the United states and our borders being secured as ... as attorney general Jeff Sessions and that's the guy that the president hits like he's opinion\nUh and everybody ... everybody seems to believe after the midterm elections will be cashiered and replaced by somebody and who would that person be I don't know if it's Rudy Giuliani Rudy Giuliani's and open borders got always has been in fact when he left\nHis gig as mayor of New York he went and start started a a a security consultancy firm and one of his clients was Mexico\nOr he was not interested in border security at all\nIf this is you know despite the obvious connection and and vulnerability to the U.S in terms of terrorism because yes it's entirely possible that people from other countries including those hostile to us\nA could harbor and co mingled terrorists\nIn a in a do business with other countries and still believe in sovereign borders and yeah security there and not a lot there's not a lot of people but there's not a lot of people in the free trade movement who believe in and out all the horse\nYeah yeah just ... as a as some other stopping some vestigial hold over it's like the appendix\nYou know it's like ... are way anymore at just that it's in the way it just makes you make it doesn't do anything any more\nUh and and that's how the one world there's really see it they want to move goods and services and people around where they're needed without all of these ... ah you're trying to blow back\nEverywhere that's what ... was about you're seeing it in Germany you're seeing it in Greece you're seeing it in Holland you're seeing it all over the world in Sweden\nOr you're seeing it in France you're seeing it in every corner of the world where there's large movements of people you're seeing the native population the indigenous population say wait a second\nWhy am I the bad guy because I Want England to be England why am I the bad guy because I Want a a I Want Greece to be grace you know in Italy where they have thousands and thousands of people from Libya coming up every day now Olivia is a disaster\nI ...

[laughter]\n[laughter]\nSo the lowest income households in the U.S on average spend four hundred and twelve dollars annually on lottery tickets which has nearly four times a hundred and five dollars a year spent by the highest earning households now this has been going on for as long as I can remember the lottery\nOr ... years and years and years ago I drove a cab and if you work twelve hours a day you could clear a hundred bucks a little over a hundred dollars\nA I mean this is thirty thirty five years ago I remember being in a cabin New York city and talking to the driver and he told me to spend a hundred dollars a week on lottery tickets ... and I know for a lot of people\nThey think that this is their only way that they're ever going to make it out of their circumstances but man this is how it got the reputation of being a poor tax\nThat's so true and I think that you're right a lot of people think that you know the odds are against them and so potentially winning the lottery might seem like they're only shot at improving their financial situation but you're right it's really adding up to a lot of money that they're wasting that they could be saving\nAmericans making less than thirty thousand dollars a year or the most likely to buy multiple lottery tickets each week and ah the according to the bank rates study two point five percent of their take home pay a spent on lottery tickets\nAnd you know that now you're in you're out that adds up\nAbsolutely ... will China emphasizes that you know that's money that ... thing and and ...\nAnd they say ... ... ... ... ... more wisely\nNow again we're talking if somebody's making less than three ... thirty thousand dollars a year we're talking about eight dollars a week\nWhich doesn't sound like a lot but if you take that same money and you put it into a retirement account month after month and and obviously as your income grows\nAnd you keep doing that you're going to end up so far it either way I look at it as I went three hundred and sixty five dollars a year in the lottery every single year of my life that's a dollar a day that I don't buy a ticket [laughter] every year every day\nUh but you know it's I I don't blame I don't really blame the lottery players I blame local governments for resorting to this scam which is really what it is\nThan what you got to do is just going to buy this ring and slip it on his or her finger when they're not when they're asleep I check ring worn on a finger at night could detect sleep apnea potentially dangerous storing condition which can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes and this could make it simpler to diagnose the problem\nA one charity estimates it almost eighty percent of cases go undetected sleep apnea obviously occurs when the muscles in the airway relax to such an extent\nThat they become completely obstructed and breathing has halted for at least ten seconds my grandmother had sleep that we didn't know what we didn't never heard the term sleep apnea back in the day he just\nMakes you kinda like God she was like a chain saw it at all\nAnd now I Know and they just started up again\nOh no no no and then when she died of a ... or actually is that I might have\nGot one of these rang I got woken up last night because my girlfriend said I was snoring too loud\nUh yeah ...\nAh what about getting set of kicking you out of the bedroom and knock it at ...

or properly managing their one billion dollar payroll\nYou know we've covered this story and variations on the the many many times and uh one of the things you know we're told is that it's cheaper\nTo pay overtime even these staggering sums of overtime than it is with pension and health costs to hire new firefighters because you'd figure if they have to have people working so much overtime that they're running up to a hundred thousand dollars a year and O T then we\nGot some kind of massive a some kind of massive a shortage of a a firefighter who don't have enough firefighters to to man the

at the station like an hour and a half from where he lives because that's just it just took him that long he's like this was my last chance I was going to give up nine years trying to be hired\nAnd it's like it's not people aren't out there trying to be heightened I understand what they're saying about well it's cheaper to just to pay these guys overtime then hire new guys I don't know if that's really the full story well are there are a lot of people trying to be hired as firemen and they just won't hire them\nWell there's never been a shortage of people applying when they when right when the LA FD\nHangs out a shingle saying that they are hiring firefighters nights it's around ... through the woods I argument has always been ... is what I'm saying I ... well it's always been that way

Angeles\nAnd uh we were out there and ah Randy was there an opinion I were there and our street a crew without a twelfth and Maine given ... groups of a Walker's as they went by and it's a wonderful day it's wonderful event it's been a big part of uh LA for a long long time\nAnd I think\nSomething has gone terribly wrong and I'm Sorry to report this\nBut this event started for years and years and years in the city of West Hollywood and it went down Santa Monica boulevard and we'll go down ... to Melrose a deliberate and it was an early Sunday Morning fun event that drew anywhere from thirty to thirty five thousand people\nAnd nobody's going anymore and I\nI don't know the politics of this going to look into it but it's disturbing because you see this is only the thirty year that they'd been holding the event in downtown Los Angeles\nAnd when they moved into downtown Los Angeles yes Eric I said he got to be up on stage with city hall behind him and it was a very dramatic photographs anyone go this year wasn't there this year and there were huge groups that have traditionally walked every year that we're missing in action\nAnd what happened and what happened\nIs somebody for some reason move this advantage to downtown Los Angeles and now instead of walking past all the shops in the heart of town you're white\nPast industrial buildings that are shuttered with metal you know a riot barriers are pulled down\nAnd graffiti and walking through homeless people or an lots of them in the in the in the time I was there I didn't catch type as well who knows give it a couple of days or I Would say anywhere from fifty to a hundred homeless people live past ... over fifty\nMaybe weren't walking ... edits and and the thing is they took what was a fantastic event that does great work that raises huge amounts of money that's vital for ... important services where people suffering from HIV in age\nAnd they've damaged the event and I don't know that it's fatally damage but somebody's got to be greatly concerned about this that this isn't working that the reality is is that people don't want to go for a walk on abandoned streets of downtown Los Angeles on a Sunday\nMorning go I think that's what you said right there because I used to live right in the heart of West Hollywood between ... yes and we couldn't get out of our driveway and we knew that Sunday yeah we would get out and if we wanted to go to the Beverly Center or something we would get out and joined the walk and it was fun it was festive and there were shops and people could why relevance\nIf everybody was down

Dodgers this is a better team are very very talented team and as you mentioned they were just in the world series last year so I think that will benefit I'm you know the experience these guys do what to expect one\nWhen the last series of the season has played\nA we're talking with Scott Miller a columnist for the bleacher report he covers ... will be a four of the bleacher report here's the thing that I've been impressed by I mean I obviously living here we get to see a lot of\nDodgers games and spend a lot of time Dodgers but uh that Boston team has the best defensive outfield I think I've ever seen\nYeah you're right that these guys go out and get the ball look you betcha right field as a gold Glover\nI'm Jackie Bradley junior field is phenomenal ... hasn't won a gold glove yet but I mean he's right there it's just a matter of time and Andrew better than the ... the oak and go get it so yeah not a lot of balls are going to drop a you know\nI like that or I'll shoot these it's like we're linked softball it's like they're playing with four outfielders\nNow it's interesting because\nWith that said the Dodgers outfield aren't bombs either because uh we saw playing game seven that may be the iconic moment or a vis a drive for the Dodgers which was Chris Taylor making a cat that certainly kept the game tied and\nWho knows because we're talking runner on second or third if not an inside the park homerun who the hell knows what would have happened without ball if he misses it and then they had the Dodgers come up and hit the three run home run an ice the game but want to play that was and and we saw a great play from Coney Ballenger or who you know ... speed\nFor a tall guy so both teams can go get it\nYeah they can't let that first while you're talking about that Chris Taylor I left the you're right that that may have better thirty saving catching the thing that was so doggone oppressive about that is I think I don't think it can be emphasized enough people need to stop and remember\nChris Taylor started that game that second but I just moved to a field that ending in a double switch and you know all of a sudden there is making the play the game and and you're right\nI think the Dodgers are straw or when the you know I Know they went through a state earlier in the air you know sometimes ballot jerk play first base but he's our best defensive outfielder him in center field um I like a lot better for the Dodgers and have\nA I Do too I think the Dodgers due to invade gotta keep max months he's batting all you have to and it was nice to get a couple of big hits too including a big home run because\nYou know he was kind of exposed a little bit by the Astros in last year's World Series or but he seems to me making the adjustment that all good hitters eventually make\nNow here's the thing I I just believe flat out that the Dodgers pitching is better than the red Sox pitching uh I\nI just think that you know one through the scrubs in the bullpen the Dodgers bullpen and starting pitching is superior\nOr to the red Sox starting pitching and yet the red Sox beat the Yankees [laughter] very good Houston deer and you saw guys like David a price who I'm very happy to see actually get a quality postseason start because he's a much better picture and that sort of like you had a\nA you know he had a curse on them or something so it's nice to see him shake that but Chris sailors Chris Sale I mean they've got quality pitchers ... uh but the bottom\nLine is I just can't believe that those rocky bullpen Endings That we saw\nComing from the from the red Sox aren't going to bite them in seven games\nYeah it'll be ... that will be one of the key is no question about it now interestingly enough ... their clothes or ... kimbrell a ... game five in Houston where they clinched kimbro filing was really good and after that game Alex core of the red Sox manager said you know what\nI knew kimbro was going to be good the day well how did you know that he said he's been tipping is pictures for two weeks and we finally figured it out and saw his hands were too high and we got him to lower his hands and now he's not a party was accepting the pitchers and he's better so that's one thing\nTo watch right out of the gate because you're right quick kimbrell after a great season ... that sort of a train wreck in October now if that's true and what the Red Sox say was tipping has pitchers then that's going to school or you would think kimbrell would would be back to his old self\nBut it'll be interesting because I think your what you say is is true the Dodgers pitching is good flip side\nThe red Sox line up I think is more versatile they they've got power they hit for average there they've got good contact hitters I mean we know all year long the Dodgers put the ball out of the park with their batting average with writers and scoring position\nHas not been good well let's ask ... similar match up to the Yankees are they hit a lot of home and they take walks and they hit home runs but what we saw Boston do [noise] and of course Alex corner played out here for the Dodgers and he's that\nClassic sort of middle infielder who play small ball\nAnd we saw Boston drop bunch we saw them do God Forbid an actual hitting Ron ...\nWhy I'm alec normal [laughter] so so that stuff\nThat you you rarely see in the nationally you never see in the American league very surprised\nMany lay down that bind but it's I think that's something they're going to have to do if they're going to win\nAgain and and now you know yeah many men I Am and shot or drive down to oh yeah yeah\nWell and here's here's here's the thing and I've\nAlways believed in October teams that can only hit home runs always make me nervous October because for a couple of reasons one in October you're facing top shelf pitching ended up facing the San Diego Padres pitching staff you're facing the best of the best so that's number one number two often times\nWhen you get out of Southern California the weather changes of October\nIt's forty five degrees here today or tomorrow is a little warmer that ... for game or they're saying in the fifties during the day but it's going to be in the forties possibly high thirties at night\nBall doesn't travel is as much as ... and so that can help her whole and hitting teams too so um that's the to me the biggest key for the Dodgers\nIs they're gonna have to get some key hits with runners scoring position you know whether they figure out a way again to play small ball like Machado\nBarred they're gonna have to score I think in ways I I'm not saying they can't hit home runs it obviously when they get back to LA for three or four or five it's going to be hot bacon maybe\nI'll get back to the whole run game but I don't think you widow World Series simply by bashing home runs a yeah I I think you need to do some other thing\nYeah the other thing too that it you know a ... in the world series and in class in general but definitely the world series pitchers that nibble the corners don't necessarily get those calls because people forget that the umpires are under a lot of scrutiny in the world series to and as a general rules\nI I just you know this is I haven't crunch data on it but it just the observation ally ... empires tend to squeeze the strikes and that's why I always let the guys like I'm Greg Maddox was you know since ... and all those Braves pitchers that lived on the black they didn't get those calls in the postseason\nNo that that I think there are two key areas to what you're saying that one is is you made it to the point you just made ... generally speaking they're not going to give you the pitch three or four inches off the plate every now and that you can run it the one who does but\nUh it is the umpire generally dealt secondly again that that keep hammering this point but back to the crust October weather that I was just talking about it's hard to hit home runs a when the when when it's forty degrees it they are thirty five and ... on there probably these games that I had a clock in the freezing\nAlso for those for best pitchers is also the weather makes it harder for them to get the ball exactly what I wanted as well and that's why they claimed throwers or you know power pitchers you can trust more yeah and I\nThe time to come see we used to talk about pitching uh Montreal and ... says I'm only from fast balls in on the hands let them fall off and they get to be that that I never\nUh there's tools and the tool box there hey remember that pizza guy
