the generic worked for that\nAnd um we are the ones that we do have doing it are just totally worn out working their lunch working fourteen hour days\nThey're having to excess but there are patients especially when it's done right and with counseling but they're just simply aren't enough of them and we have so many rigorous regulations about the special training that they take in order to do it

incredibly difficult political got let's run especially his because he's the swing vote\nYou know Neil Gorsuch went through pretty easily I mean they put up a bit of a dust up for political reasons but Neil Gorsuch wasn't replacing the determinants swing vote\nWhich is Justice Kennedy for ... which could give a permanent conservative majority for a very long time or going forward and as a result we knew that the Democrats would essentially save their heavy am all for whoever came next because this was going to be the Armageddon fight and of course it's it's gone where\nAre we couldn't have anticipated it would go back\nI have is reading something where they they were just talking about people voting across the Senate and went Antonin Scalia was was voted it was Ninety eight to nothing I Know voted demand right in the same is true for\nYou know or a under normal circumstances that's kind of what you get right but these aren't normal circumstances so not normal times so as soon as these allegations surfaced a ... and as soon as a Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid I categorically emphatically denies these allegations this never happened so there's no\nThere's no shade of gray here there's no there's no\nPossibility of anything a lock and if you even know you write and never happened never announced when they're never ever anything never happened so therefore if that's your physician\nThan FBI investigation bring it on in that act I insist that you clear my name we're my now but it wasn't even asked during the hearing if you'll open and that's the F ... welcoming FBI investigation he would not answer the question of nine times and\nAnd and the more it was asked and the more he went back to it as the gated six times was irrelevant because you see the previous FBI inquiries didn't investigate this yeah that's the problem\nWe they do matter and well they didn't even know to investigate because nobody some were that's why it ... it was not there to be in that that is right but everybody knows that so they are recording that I've had ... FBI inquiries is a ...\nIt's an invasion or so to me the public relations move and and look this isn't a court of law this was a perception issue if somebody's made a horrific allegation against you and your insisting that you're a hundred percent innocent then bring it on baby bring on whatever investigation you gotta bring it on\nBecause it will will it stops the people of immediately concluded that you're guilty of course not bought for reasonable people who are persuadable\nA ... bringing in a ... an FBI investigation and getting a thrill to reports or to backup that yes we we found nothing that's incriminating in any way shape or form ... would would just basically mean that only the partisans are now clinging to this\nMight only be able to get them on something less than like lying about being a blackout drunk\nWhile you see now that brings us to something that's very ... and he probably not going to be on the Supreme Court you see that's the problem because ... ... besides the perjury issue that he's denied being a blackout drunk and this\nThis is significant or if he acknowledges or admits that when he was back in his heavy drinking days that he drank to the\nPoint where he didn't remember things then that opens the possibility that this could have happened and he just doesn't remember because he was a ... during the blackout period and guess what how do\nYou prove that to well I don't ... I don't know how you can be made a lot of my friends ... you drank until you pass out but like\nHow do you know that you blacked out and you're still physically doing things that you just don't remember because you're in a state of being conscious I'm ... well but I'm saying how do you prove that thirty six years ago other than people say oh yeah he was totally drunk but everybody's been totally wrong well the thing is it doesn't mean you did things that you don't remember I mean how do you prove that you can't prove it\nBut the thing is is that if there are stories or if there are many stories of from roommates and friends in high school and college contradicting saying oh he did drink a lot when he sang oh and during that my end\nOf the next day saying he didn't run what did I Do last night you know right sharp and now you've got you've got testimony to say no there were plenty of times when he drank to the point that he didn't remember what it dry up for them\nAs like how did I get here ... and speeches where he was talking about piecing together memory round in soccer and that's the problem there's some there's some contemporaneous are notations and storytelling\nThat would indicate and this is where his friend mark judge\nA is very significant because while he had his problems that they they were high school we meant for each other so so ... ... again the ... you can't prove that in itself doesn't prove anything but now you've got two points where he may have perjured himself during his testimony and this is where you get to the\nCredibility of witnesses a doctor Ford's got her own problem she didn't remember where it was she doesn't remember how she got there she doesn't remember about how she got home ... ... there was a pretty big holes and store yet but if he's the one under oath in the Senate confirmation hearing I personally think he was less than truthful which was a very polite\nA way for saying law about his explanation over the run that uh uh\nAround on a on a day or run our tae however it on to name a Renata\nRenata alumnus a which seemed like a crash way that the boys were bragging if they had all been there and done that right or or at least to attempted to get to first base or what wherever no doubt wrote her as a player or whatever it is that is certainly that's what it applies\nAnd and now she was one of our ... that extra now shuttered ... didn't pass one she found out she was ... trying to pass the smell test either Mr lots of drinking game\nSo ah you know and that's a problem because now you have multiple incidents of testimony when ah when the credibility of the judge is is a legitimately called into question and again it's a\nIt once you lie about one thing then you could lie about other things so we've got two witnesses a Ford has big holes in her story\nAnd the judge seems to be massaging and I'm being very a diplomatic here a major details of uh of his story too\nAnd that's why you need an F investigation let that go find out what they can find out and put as much information before us as possible a ... ... ... you know I Know that it's asking too much for anybody to hold their judgments until we get this information because you know it's not going to change anybody's mind and these partisan times that's a virtually impossible\nBut ah but the game is on anyway and and I get my bigger concern is ... how does the Supreme Court go forward\nWith the moral authority that it has to have in order to function and watch the game here in America if if the idea is that we're just going to de legitimize any institution or individual that we personally dislike or for political reasons dislike I don't know how we hold the country together\nOr let's go sit at a Richard Ontario Richard how are you\nIn

I I'm guessing that this is one of the most uh\nA persistent problems that comes to any council manic office\nWhere it is and this one this you know difficult to to pin down because uh you know neighbors quality complain about a dog barking\nOur city is challenge we have a limited resources that are edible controlled apartment so by the time somebody gets out there to investigate the problem you know there's usually a little little that can be done or so this is an attempt to address the problem\nYeah and it it it is a problem because I mean I you know we're here I live in the west San Fernando valley and I've got a a neighbor's live behind me\nAnd they're very good neighbors they take great care of their property everything's wonderful except they work really long hours and they've got a dog that has access in and out of the house and the dog barks all day long and they don't know it because as soon as they come home the dog is\nA happy go lucky and uh they you know if the dog starts barking of course they control the barking but for twelve to Thirteen maybe fourteen hours a day and the dog is barking\nAt that that sounds similar to what happens here a ... and\nIt's a real problem ah you know our homes or rather close proximity\nUm a lot of folks have young children or um you know they're dealing with with elderly parents and the dogs barking\nOr do either to children or appeared that dish on the verge of dementia at all time was off their schedule with it and it really\nCause havoc causes habit for those family so I don't know for some people when you're talking about dogs barking they may say you know at the house with oh Chad more serious issues but believe me the fact that you're calling me for\nThe Los Angeles and and I've received emails from all over the country regarding this shows that it's not just a problem unique jak Ohio\nNo ... it's a quality of life issue because my wife and I have literally been bark out of our own yard\nI mean it's so we're ... you can't sit outside on a nice summer day we're talking with Ross Neal who's on the uh in Akron, Ohio city council now I'm ... again\n... the the uh news article that I have that brought this to our attention says\nThat would allow for the possibility or proposed ordinance\nWould allow for the possibility of six days in jail I assume that there's many many steps before that happens in it that would be a quarter of last resort\nCorrect uh uh right now uh ours is a minor\nMisdemeanor which I Believe comes up to a ... of a of a hundred dollars and a as a stairs right now the or this hasn't been enough to persuade some folks that change uh their animals behavior at how they ah you know maintain their dogs so this is an attempt\nAnd have legislated areas where you can smoke almost out of existence mhm so uh it it we made the inconvenience factor plus the expense plus the health warnings have greatly reduce the number of people who are smoking\nThen you've had a ... of course drinking and\nDriving which is another thing wearing seatbelts is another thing sewed and now we're combating texting while driving less successfully a ... and and this\nIs a ... certainly a drug addiction we seem to be failing on that as well because whereas a lot of folks have moved away from a categories of drugs we've replaced them with an opioid epidemic and a prescription pill epidemic that's through the roof\nSo it's almost like whack a mole was human behavior but when it comes to what we eat people's diets what we'd like to eat is so personal and ... there's tremendous push back when you've got some busy body that's trying to meddle with how and what you why\nBecause they just push back and go don't shame me for liking my ... my ... year my ID and your\nGluten free artesian well water into baked a granola bars you know knock yourself just leave me alone yeah definitely\nIs of course a love of junk food and I grew up doing that most of my whole life but I think this also shows with you know your kids eating fast food is there's so many parents that they are both working now no one's got time to be cooking actual meals anymore\nWell no and that's a choice people just choose not to do it you\nThere are ways that you can still ... and ... at home it's I cook at home and I'm busy [laughter] and yeah so you put it in the upper\nWell that is in danger you Randy I'd I'd had what what about the word choice it's not answering the question that they just like the parents making the choice to take kids to the fast food and drug inning of\nThat article that you're talking about with kids are like there are better choices for kids with those happy meals like chocolate milk and the fruit side and I you know chocolate milk ... great full of sugar to and then like the free choice says that's full of you know corn syrup as well and I'm thinking what happened to just not eating a fast food or maybe high\nWater water well water is no fun yeah okay well that I had a bad parent where you're right there and we've\nTurned water into a into a flavor drink because you go to the I fill up my kids water jugs everyday and everywhere we go water soda aisle and it's all got flavored water now come out water and all these different however parent I control it water but uh but the thing is if the parent\nLikes junk food then the chances are that the kids are going to guess what I drive a water\nWell when when people again are when you see a a morbidly obese child and then you wonder well how doesn't fall far from the ... how did a nine year old gets so heavy well what did the parents put in the shopping cart and bring into the house there are benefits\nI mean my dad used to use me as an excuse to get more food so he'd say well ready really wants fries so we got to

gentleman uh we are here until ten o'clock this morning the Dodgers dodge disaster by a sweeping the giants and this afternoon at one o'clock\nIs they're going to be an action at Chavez Ravine against the Colorado Rockies if they when they are the division champs if they lose their still in the playoffs but they've got the uh elimination game the wildcard slot in its winner go home so let's all go they'll shake in the LA Times about that and more\nYou can grab a thousand dollars four times a day\nWhere do I grant here which so not\nThere for a day on seven Ninety saving money starts falling

in the morning every one of ... and it's been one year since the deadliest single they mass shooting in ... in us history the concert massacre in Las Vegas yesterday an interfaith memorial was held in Las Vegas to remember the fifty eight who lost their lives game and shelling ended a paramedic who was there\nThey're just not as good as the Dodgers and the Dodgers problem and frankly the reason they're in the situation they are today and they spent a lot of time the season Wang bad teams and getting beat but they lost the season serious to the Cincinnati Reds they lost a serious to Marlins in Miami you just can't do that\nAnd expect to cruise to a division titles so instead of having a leisurely day to relax and the grind of a long season and prepare for the playoffs the Dodgers we'll be back at work at a few hours\nThe Dodgers are are are becoming one of those enigmatic teams like the Atlanta Braves or not this year's Atlanta Braves but you know you'll end up ... what do they win like Thirteen consecutive eastern division titles and they only managed to cash in one world championship\nOr you know ... and at some point uh you you know you got to\nThe deal after a while the fan base doesn't care about getting to the post season if ever there was a team whose fan base and really organization were not interested even and getting to the world series they want to win the world\nThey want the game seven last year nothing but winning is acceptable at this point\nThat's a very fair point and in fact there's a very direct link between the Braves of the nineties that you mention and the Dodgers have today and that is and cast it and it was the president of the Braves than it is the president of the Dodgers now and he is very well aware that\nAfter a while or the fan base comes to become conditioned the Dodgers when every year and the fans maybe don't buy as many tickets and don't get as invested in the team\nOr early in the years they might in a place for winning was new and yes it's been Thirty years since Kirk Gibson and for all the joy that that one a home run Thirty years ago\nIt was brought to a lot of people in Southern California it would be nice to come to Dodger Stadium and have a World Series highlight reel it's not you know the ... guide twitching his elbow going around first base but he also be the hero\nChange out for the sake of the LA Times who's going for Colorado today\nA modern Marquez a terrific young pitcher ah it certainly will not be a walk in the park to borrow horrible cliche for the Dodgers but on the other hand the Dodgers took a great gamble up in San Francisco because before yesterday's game they had to decide that they want\nWalker bill or their electric rookie to pitch yesterday for a chance maybe to win the division and avoid a tie breaker or if it does come down to one game today that they want us to pitch that game so what they did it and said you know giants\nNo disrespect aren't that great\nAnd if it comes down to one game dealers the guy we want so they let rich he'll start yesterday that worked out great it was terrific and they have ... ready to go today and you know as long as quite in her size here he will always be described as the ace but the guy who's pitching the best right now for the Dodgers is Walker Mueller\nThat's right and by blowing out the giants yesterday that gave a a they have the Dodgers the luxury of a of arresting the bullpen they want to use and that they will need to use in a ... but this is really crunch time because\nYou know we always talk about the uh the wild card game as a as high pressure because it's do or die but\nIn reality the Dodgers were in a situation where they are planning a whole bunch of do or die games at the end of the year and this has always been one of those arguments in the baseball world is it better to wrap it up three weeks early and rest your regulars in line up you're pitching or do you get rusty doing that at ... and ... are you better off playing pressure games right to the wire\nA and having to play your way fight your way all the way through the playoffs at the Dodgers really don't have a choice now that's what they have to do\nRight and the great thing in baseball history is if you say best thing is to roll through division wrap up early have plenty of time to rest set up for the playoffs you can find examples of teams that did that and went up to World Series with and if you say\nNo no no you want to have the games matter all the wait till the end and you want pressure and you want to do or die games that's what gets you ready to win a World Series you can also find teams that won the world series that way so the Dodgers are where they are and last year it was right Nate wrapped it up\nWith about three months to go it seems like and you get everything ready and they did get to a game seven of the world series so we'll see how the other way it goes this year\nYeah hey well we've got you here I Want to pick your brain real quick on uh the angels ... boot because Mike social after Nineteen years is moving on\nA and I have to say obviously a social will forever be a giant part of angels history because of the two thousand two World Series title the only time we have\nWhen I got to be honest with ya I I'm Amazed that he lasted as long as he did that's incredible patients given the tenor and and and pay some of the modern game\nWell it is but when already Marino who bought the team from the Walt Disney company\nCame in social was in place as you mentioned the angels had just won the world series they kept rolling with five division titles in six years and at that point art in Reno could see that they had a good thing going into his credit\nHe didn't try to mess it up by you know I'm going to bring in my own guys he went in fact the other direction to such extreme that agave Sosa ten year contract and made him the highest paid manager and the major leagues and angels baseball was going to be identified with my ...\nI'm so why did social last that long well this was the time the or the contract you know I think everybody came to realize that was a great place for a new start for both the angels and from my Sosa\nYeah uh and uh of course the next a big deal is going to be a are they able to tie up my trout and make him a the franchise player while he already he is the franchise player but\nOr is he going to be the guy who's a lifetime angel and play his whole career here because there's always been talk that well you know he's in South Jersey guy he's a group as a Phillies fan he'd like to go home eccentric cetera but uh I don't know how the angels can afford to let Mike a Trump go\nWell financially you're right they can't afford it let them go and they can't afford to keep them um but it's his decision ultimately it's not the angels and Mike Trout is made perfectly clear he just wants one thing he wants to win\nHe's never said a bad word about the angels he likes living in Southern California I guess if I\nHad to go home to winters in South Jersey I'd like living in orange county too but uh but he wants to win and remember he's already signed one long term deal with the angel she could have been a free agent last year so he gave up their fears of free agency to to stay in Anaheim and\nI think he will wait to see what the angel Stu how the young players come along there's a lot of talk that angel shut off from a\nBig fat contract this year and a few dozen sign it they should trade them so they could get more young players uh I don't see that happening at all I don't know why my outlook sign the contract this year because he's going to make his money where there are signs this year next year and two years you know barring some serious injury he needs another year to see how the angels progress and\nI Would think that if they do progressed they'd have a pretty good chance to keep them but\nIf they don't progress I don't see why he wouldn't necessarily want to stay if you get a better chance to win somewhere else\nHey Bill thanks so much for coming on with us ah and ah we can't wait for first pitch one o'clock\nThis afternoon it take you it's a dodge a sick day for Southern California I calmed down and so now you don't have to worry about ... how do I am fine a\nLead as the gentleman eight hundred to two two KBC is the number and um you know many years ago probably ten years ago I wrote a\nColumn a about a ... about\nPeople leaving California and and uh it it just occurred to me\nThat a fun way of looking at this is to go to the U Haul website and I put in at the time my brother was uh living in Raleigh North Carolina and I put it in my address and I put in his address\nAnd I priced a U Haul truck\nGoing

the city attorney for Huntington Beach Michael gates welcome aboard Mr Gates how are you\nGood morning how are you I'm fine first of all congratulations and thank you very much\nAnd talk to us about what was the argument that you made as talk to us about what a charter city is and why that made a difference\nThere are so ah so there are four hundred and eighty two cities in the state of California or a hundred and Twenty one of which are charter cities when it's when a general ... said he seeks to declare some sort of independence from the state of California um\nAnd to establish some level of local control free of state interference they can adopt a charter\nAnd when you when you're when a city adopts a charter it's basically a mini constitution for the city itself and then also like I said a declaration of independence\nArticle eleven section five car of the of the California Constitution carved out\nA certain amount of local control so what the city of Huntington Beach did was it said to the state of California in its lawsuits challenging has to be fifty four is hey control over our police department\nAre with regards to law enforcement activities and control over our own spending of our general fund money's those are quote municipal affairs and quote that are specifically protected and provided for by the California Constitution\nSo I'm S. B. fifty four in essence was an overreach\nOr because it's hard to tell our police department what it can and cannot do\nWith regard to its law enforcement activities and also it told 'em it was ... it it tells cities where they can and cannot do with its resources whether it's public schools um designating them as safe havens or general fund moneys that we couldn't spend money on certain activities with regard to law enforcement and\nThat was just that's too far that's an unconstitutional overreach and it's actually built into the California Constitution\nExpressly so it's a huge win for hunting beach but I also want to clarify it shoots when for every other city that has a charter like Huntington Beach is so this is a pretty broad ruling and it's a significant blow to the state law\nWell that's how I see it a undoubtedly there will be an appeal because this is a this is a ... you know obviously a a hundred and eighty degrees away from the dominant political culture in the state of California and a threat to their thinking\nRight and and and quite frankly Huntington Beach was the only city in the entire state of California although other cities were passing ordinances and resolutions in response to F ... if ... if\nI'm Sorry SP fifty for um they were passing ordinances right and resolutions business the only law suit\nUm and and the the reason that we used to just because like I said it was an overreach um but\nOur basis for our challenge is built in expressly under the constitution so in a way\nI'm surprised we're the only city when it goes up on appeal the\nCourt's gonna have to see the same constitution that we see it's article ... section five subdivision be um and even subdivision a applies as well so um if they're in plain English um it says right there that I'm a local affair for a charter city is managing its police force it's right there in the constitution and\nNo state law can supersede the state the state constitution excuse me so you know it will go up on up hill I don't doubt it um but I don't\nYou know I think it's pretty clear and a quarter of people's gonna have to read the constitution the same way and uphold um ah what the court did a last Thursday\nWe're talking with Michael gate to the city attorney for Huntington Beach in it was his argument before uh the uh Orange County superior court judge a James Crandall they carry the day\nOr by the way it is a hundred and Twenty one charter cities in the state of California so\nUh there was not all of them will opt to take the same uh steps that uh Huntington Beach as but certainly a number of them well now I can I expand this conversation to the bigger issue and I'm not a lawyer so I I'll I'll obviously defer to your judgment on this\nBut you know we had a attorney general Jeff Sessions on the show a couple of times\nTo talk to them about this specific issue and it's been my contention from day one that when as B. fifty four was advanced what was really at stake here I don't care how people come down on the immigration issue when it comes down here\nUh is is our entire system of government because we live under a system a system of federalism and the supremacy clause of the constitution says that federal law supersedes state law and presumably state law would supersede a county law or municipal law\nBut a ... how does this fall into the sort of the dynamic of our system of federalism\nWell it's a it's a very interesting question on the federal government is a a limited government as defined by the U.S constitution\nA notably the California state government even though it doesn't feel this way all the time\nIt's actually a a limited government under the California Constitution as well the federal government does occupy the entire field of a federal immigration and what Jeff Sessions and his lawsuit was seeking do as invalidate S. B. fifty for another sanctuary laws because it interfered with the federal government's efforts\nUm and I've told people all along you know that's that is a little bit of a tough sell because really the federal government can't commandeer state and local resources to affects your weight it's federal policy but but this is the hypocrisy of us be fifty for the state tried to do that with\nLocal government so while the state was saying hey federal government and you can't come in resource to help you affects your weight well then they turn around and the sanctuary state laws income and their local resources\nYeah and so I was that that was our pushback is hey you know back off hands off our local police department and our general fund moneys and our other resources that um S. B. fifty for such commandeer now you can't have it both ways\nWell we this was not only ... predictable it was predicted we said the day that this past that uh if California can nullify a federal law than what's to stop a city or county\nFrom ... in a state law and and if you keep following this to its logical conclusion then why couldn't individuals' started to say well I'm Sorry I don't uh I I I I Know the ... the city law I mean this is why we're we're pulling it some very very uh important threads here that hold\nThey'd keep the United states United a ... and and I still go back to uh to to ask the fifty four fundamentally is California declaring essentially its own foreign policy and\nRight and and and and moreover if a state as allowed from Sacramento to have a reach all the way to Huntington Beach and\nDictate what it's police force can and cannot do if it's constitutionally allowed to do that then there's no need for local governments I mean if the state can basically um send out one size fits all policy a\nAnd programs for every corner of California than than at Avi eight's the need for local control and local city ...\n... police departments so um you know we're thrilled with the court's ruling I I think it sends a message to the state um that they're not going to get away with it and you know frankly I think they knew that they ... they couldn't or shoved into under the California Constitution but they tried it anyway\nAnd you know we hold them accountable and I think it's going to stand all the way through I think it's a terrific willing and it's good for it really is good for all of California um because regardless of what your local persuasion czar and local policies are\nEverybody whether you're a Democrat Republican liberal conservative you should want local control\nA yes the closer the ... as a general rule that's true ah ... you know ... and the question now is what have you heard from uh the state yet have you heard about\nWhat the what what the appellate process will look like a and and also a second part\nOf that question have you heard from any of the other a hundred and twenty charter cities are wanting to know\nUh how you win about it\n[laughter] um well they they benefit from the ruling if they have charters like Huntington Beach or we have had we've had a a few charter said he's one of which has lost seldom does um who's embroiled in a lawsuit by the ACLU because they sell it made us had adopted an ordinance to basically opt out of sb fifty four which\nUh F. B. fifty four didn't have any opt out provision so hum Huntington Beach didn't go that route but anyway there embroiled in a lawsuit um with this ruling since last I was also a charter city that
