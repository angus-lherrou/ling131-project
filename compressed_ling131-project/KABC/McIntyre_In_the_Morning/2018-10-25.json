office and then if past ... can offer any guidance\nIn twenty six team one point for four trillion income taxes were paid by one hundred and forty point nine million taxpayers reporting a total of ten point two trillion adjusted gross income\nUh so what we're finding out now is that the top three percent of us taxpayers paid almost all of the income taxes and twenty sixteen to talk to us about this

John how are ya\nI'm well Doug how're you doing I'm fine do you do you sometimes feel like we've got you on speed dial\n[laughter] and that's fine that's fine because the more education the better I think your point is a good one this is a name that's been out there for a long time\nThat the rich are paying their fair share I Do think the rich are more adept because of their access to attorneys in CPA\nExploiting the system correct but as a general proposition\nIt is the the the wealthy pay and then\nA percentage of the income tax far in excess of what would be a flat rate I think everybody would agree like under a flat rate tax everybody pays a dollar ... hundred dollars so you make a lot you paid that much more\nThe problem in in the United states and particularly in California to talk about California in ... but but is when you have\nWhen you have a progressive income tax system you're basically punishing\nImprovements in the in your economic status of the better you do the more you get punished\nAnd not sure that's good tracks policy and I think this is a\nPerennial debate that we have with the people on the list is that wouldn't it be more fair to get rid of all the loopholes a and and the tax evasion tactics but flat and the rates and I think that would be the position that we would take\nThe downside of that because some of those loopholes make it possible for people to underwrite scholarships and scientific research and the arts et cetera et cetera\nSo you know even there you know our tax situation is complicated and its emotional\nOr end its organic to the American character this nation was founded on a tax revolt that's what the Boston Tea party was sure uh that's what this in protest against a stamp act in the intolerable act and you know this stuff is part of the the DNA of America now personally\nI actually supported graduated income tax because I'm going to use the simple or the simple is number so I can understand that but if somebody makes that say ten thousand dollars and we had a ten percent flat tax well they've got to pay a thousand dollars in taxes\nWell now you've got to live on nine thousand dollars whereas if you make ten million dollars you might pay a million dollars in taxes but it's a it's not a tough slog to get by on nine million dollars or so so I don't mind I graduated a income tax\nUh but there's a difference between a graduated income tax and the system that we have right now which is\nA can fiscal tore in many cases it ... there are entire categories there are different brackets where it does exactly what you're talking about it's a disincentive there are people who are offered raises by their bosses that actually it's not an air interest to accept the raise it'll it'll actually they'll end up losing money\nMay or may be people throwing some slack and him but you know what from personal experience I can just say this rock hope speaks the truth\n[noise] have you seen is Latin local at five thirty good morning everyone a ... a white nationalist from Huntington Beach is in federal custody for allegedly inciting racial violence across the country\nRobert run do was denied bail at a hearing\nIn the LA federal court the FBI says he was arrested Sunday at LAX to other members of\nThe rise above movement Tyler law of Redondo Beach and Robert Bowman I'm Torrance were taken into custody Wednesday on suspicion of inciting violence in Charlottesville, Virginia Huntington Beach San Bernardino in Berkeley fourth suspect results were charged but remains at large object ...

I don't know if it's to Robert Deniro I don't think he lives in that try big building but it actually made it up to the seventh floor well it wasn't like left in the mail room made it up to the seventh\nOr that that doesn't choice made because the level of security checks goes way down from President of the United states right you know goes to a\nBuilding right I Will never used cars I heard Robert Deniro in bomb and I thought they were talking about little ... or\nVirtually like his last movie yes\nEvery movie that lasts eight nine years yeah All right well we might as well laugh at it because otherwise you cry because what are you very serious it is it's it's just awful and that\nBy the way is a true for a your Dodgers so this is actually the most interesting ... that that's come out of the world series thus far Ryan Madsen ... a little hesitant heritage five runners in this World Series and two games all five have scored\nAnd mad since E. R. A. is zero point zero\nZero [laughter] you see this is what's happened the eyes you lock them all pitching statistics oh no well no or you know ... or the lines that right there in is not on his account they all went on somebody else yeah hitching statistics had become almost meaningless certainly a wins have become meaningless\nOr for starting pitchers I mean it makes no sense whatsoever that are starting pitcher can go a five and a third\nActually I think five and a third as the when if you go five and a third you qualify for the ... let's say you go for full innings a and you can take it out of the game and you pitched great but they take care of the gate for whatever reason and some relief pitcher can actually come in and not throw a pitch and get a when\nYou literally can get a win without throwing a pitch in other words as a run or a third base you come in from the bullpen a in a tie game ah the guy\nOr or your team has a runner on third excuse me your team as a runner on third\nAh he scores and you pick a runner offer first base or a guy gets a cold out for interference right you've never throwing a fit right and because you had your own around where I had a run scored you get the when it's in saying we're so it makes no sense whatsoever but anyway\nUh the problem really\nUh the Dodgers pitching hasn't been great lesson it was fine they last for two what are you going to do\nUh the problem with the Dodgers is they don't have an answer to the relentless Boston often no that they don't\nGive up a single at that and and all the damage was done last night with two outs that's what they do too well they're they're like a ... a back to a beehive ... just passed\nWhen they've got two outs because they sailed through the for the first two outs of that in a no problem and then the wheels came off because they couldn't get the third out to close out that ending\nSo uh they're in trouble here there is that\nJust will get all the bad news out of the way early on uh in the history of the world series if you look at the data the teams that go down\nThey got to narrow and they didn't get Alec Baldwin\nThis goes to ... uh Maxine Waters a one went to Maxine Waters Hillary Clinton President Obama George Soros Eric Holder John Brennan of course the CNN officers with the very latest on this story go to New York and Steve Casablanca mornings Dave\nYeah good morning we watched a in the pre dawn hours as the NYPD closed off a section of Greenwich Street in the ... neighborhood\nAnd a converged on the topic a grill the restaurant owned by Robert De Niro and they took away another suspicious package sources said that it bore similarities to the one that was sent to CNN found in the time Warner centers mail room\nAnd those tend to Brock Obama Hillary Clinton George Soros and others are I guess really not surprising maybe for some of the FBI said yesterday that they were concerned that more packages were out there and that whoever was responsible for this would\nContinue sending these types of explosive devices until they're caught\nA Steve we had a report that the bomb that was sent to George Soros the first one up in Bedford\nWas hand delivered do we know the method of delivery of all the bombs is it a combination some being males who the postal services that are like fed ex or ... or ... or how are they being ... how are they being delivered\nThey happened elaborated on that the the investigators looking into this haven't given a specific and and it's purposeful because if they reveal too much about their investigation that could cause the person or persons who are responsible for this to change\nTheir their MO and so that that specific type of detail they haven't given out to the public although you can rest assured that the police and the FBI are scouring a security camera videos again this morning taken from the area around the Tribeca Grill\nStandard practice for them to do that in it and it won't be surprising given the public nature of the uh the delivery of this particular package in New York this morning that that we would possibly see the release of some video a showing maybe a a person of interest um it won't be surprised if\nIf that's the case later today that they really some sort of a still image or something like\nThat we're talking with Steve ... who's in New York now there was a photograph published of the a device that was sent to CNN and it appeared to be it's appeared to have a timer on it some kind of a digital component\nOr are we hearing anything about the nature of the other explosives are they all of a similar type or they or are they different designs\nThey they've described them in that they way they said they're they are similar explosive devices they've been characterized as pipe bombs that have a explosive powder in them some of them apparently have projectiles packing them as well\nBut whether or not they were a design that more to scare than to actually detonate we don't know there's a lot of speculation about that but investigators having to address that a one way or another\nAh the reason I asked him at the time or is that particular because a pipe bomb is a very simple device but once you get into\nA having timers on them you're getting into a level of sophistication also the fact that they're being handled roughly through the mail or through the internal mail room systems of large organizations\nMeans that either they were nerds and meant justice scare or that they were very sophisticated that the detonation devices were not so sensitive to go off prematurely\nYeah and and again there is a lot of information about these are devices that uh the investigators are able to to garner because they have these unexploded devices and and\nUh and of course again that there are scouring a security camera videos but you know that the envelopes could provide information perhaps if if the uh if the person or persons did did leave behind any sort of DNA evidence on on those envelopes the materials used to construct these explosive devices\nAre there there are ways that they can be traced as well so there's a lot that investigators are aren't revealing because they don't want to tip their hat [noise]\nAll right well obviously there's going to be much more on this story as we go forward thanks so much Steve

dangerous it's all dangerous stuff and it's all scary stuff\nAnd I and I have to uh you know tell you we've\nBeen warning about this for very long time on the show that the rhetoric the ugliness of politics they the hateful and it's just politics\nHas gotten to the point where someone's going to get killed and we've had so many clothes brushes with this one Steve's college was shot and that maniac one of the shoot up the Republican baseball team well there were practicing for the Congress a congressional a baseball game\nOr I mean so it's it started I mean so yeah people have already been shot yeah and there's\nBeen lots of attacks and you see these flash mobs driving you know mostly Republicans out of restaurants or go into people's homes there have been a couple of Democrats actually Nancy Pelosi got driven out of a restaurant over the weekend or\nA bunch of right wing activists who found out she was there and then showed up controller\nAnd this breakdown of civility did not start with Donald Trump I mean he certainly has poured gas on the fire that's his playing style yesterday we had teleprompter Trump\nWhile the president was signing a much needed bill to push back against the scourge of opioid addiction and that's a very positive development by the way he took the opportunity of talking about these bombs that have been sent out and he said basically all the right things this is what some of it sounded like\nThose days in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally to factor no one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains we should\nNot mob people in public spaces or destroy public property while it's a\n... there's no arguing with anything that he said I and I feel it's so sad that we even have to say that out loud isn't that just a given we used to just not even have to say that he has to say here's what used to be that that was civility\nWell yeah although it through our history we have certainly been through ethics where where we went through everything that we've seen today and in some cases worse I I've always mentioned in Eighteen fifty two and no I wasn't\nThere to buy an Eighteen Seventy two that I Know that it's the same ... [laughter] as a resident get the body drive on that ... and pressed Brooks\nOf South Carolina actually was Eighteen fifty six siblings precedent Brooks of South Carolina is a congressman\nAnd he walked off the floor of the United States House of representatives onto the floor of the United States Senate while I was in session and took his walking stick and smash it over the skull of Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner nearly beat him to death split ... head open\nAnd it took ... years to recover from that injury a when a precedent Brooks went home to South Carolina he was given a hero's welcome and when it was reported that he smashed his walking stick in the attack he was sent hundreds of walking sticks by supporters from all over the ...\nSo we have been ah we've been down many roads are that were really really ugly the differences of course we didn't have twenty four hour cable news in our phones et cetera et cetera et cetera\nNow the reason that Trump's speech was interesting to me yesterday is that he said all the right things and so did by the way and I I have yet to say this on any topic\nA New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is very eloquent yesterday and talking about the need for us to stay United as a people and to understand that there are just some uh lunatics on the fringe who will act\nOut like this but with Trump I I I\nJust shake my head and listen to him read his speech that was clearly written by other people than watch them go to rallies and start the lock her up chants and a\nAppraise the congressman from body slamming a reporter and a call the journalists enemies of the people and tied at political rallies tell people to refer him up and I'll pay your legal bills and on and on and we go its colossal hypocrisy\nUh it's it's stunning hypocrisy on his part now there's plenty of people on the left who are equally guilty of this but you see this is where we keep coming back I don't believe the front of the United states is on par with some lunatic activists somewhere in front of the United states speaks for the country\nAnd that's what Donald Trump doesn't do well\nHe speaks for Donald Trump wow All right but he doesn't speak for the country well and I know that his attitude is if you hit me I hit back Carter but the problem is is that when you engage in gutter language and bully threats\nThan you are lowering yourself you're lowering the country by association to the gutter and he's done it\nFor his entire career but he did it before he was president and he did it when I was running for president and he does it as president he's just filling formed adult he's in his seventies she's not going to change we did we accepted that that this is what it is but when you go out and give a speech like this\nI what what effect can it half because you know we don't want the eight hours now\nYou're going to undo or whatever good you did whatever those words because it's not his language it's not the way he talks it's somebody else's life he had to read it yeah it's written because if he goes off script he's likely to say something that would be the exact contradiction of what he's saying\nA ... so you know the president should set the tone and and a perfect example of this\nA real perfect example of this is when the court threw out what was a a a an absurd lawsuit by Stormy Daniels I'm Michael Sullivan oddity that somehow Donald Trump had a\nThe famed the porn star Stormy Daniels and what did you do instead of just letting it sit taking the victory the courts or on your side they they toss the case he's got to get into horse face\nHe's gotta he's got he's got a comment on it in a in a crash and low brow or what manner and it sets a tone now again and please emphasize if you're a Trump supporter I don't believe that Donald Trump started this that we've been headed down this road for a very very long time and I think societal society wise\nWe have we've all got a we've all got dot com courage\nThat people are real tough guys when they're on line and you can really lead people have it with both barrels with no risk of taking the fish to the face\nSo and so but what happens is inevitably it leads to fish in the face because people are enraged and and you know I I really wish the national standard where before you post something before you say something does this make the country better\nOne of them are seriously if you asked yourself that question before you open your trap and I and I include myself by the way at the front 'cause I have a microphone\nSo so there should be a sign on all of these microphones that say are you making the country better\nAnd you know where a solution oriented morning show and I think that would be a great idea for Facebook Twitter Instagram everything before you hit the post button a prompt comes up are you sure you want to post this but here's the\nThing Randy a and this is the this is the culture shift that is so dangerous and President Trump said yesterday bill de Blasio said he yesterday and another people many people have said we've been saying here for very long time once\nYou define your enemies as evil your political opponents as evil not just wrong or wrongheaded\nBut evil that they're they're raised on debt is to destroy the country\nLeft or right on both sides feel the straw very passionately the right absolutely believes that the left are evil that their God Bless communist\nIf not a front for Islamic fascism or whatever kind of concocted evil they can come up with and are here to solve Lenski and George Soros and everybody else are here to destroy America\nAnd and the left is absolutely convinced that the Republican Party are neo Nazis that they hate\nOr the ... they hate Mother Earth they want to pay the whales that can't stand women they hate minorities are racist and on and on and on it goes so we have created a armies of monsters with ours and D's next to their names or ales and sees if you want liberal and conservative\nAnd and when you elevate politics to a fight between good and evil\nAnd weren't good and they're evil than there are no bars old now it becomes a dorm room conversation after two talks to the ball and you say if you could go back in time and you could kill Hitler and we had that we had that lunatic teacher in Minnesota who was advocating that somebody on the left take one for the team that was a direct\nQuote and assassinate Brett Kavanaugh oh boy All right that's where we're headed and I remind you when arch jokes are friends for it and on and Sarajevo was assassinated in Nineteen fourteen set the war\nSo on fire when a lunatic communist from Holland a burn the rights dog for a set the rights dog and Germany on fire the Hitler and the Nazis used that as a pretense to crush opposition and lift the views of what became the Holocaust and World War two\nThe way quick correction it was Nineteen eighty one world series against the Yankees the Dodgers lost the first two on the road and came back and won the world championships so it has been done by the Dodgers what it was an eighty two carts you've got a while back wrong I did want to me\nUh I'm now he's no I don't\nUh let's go and six thirty let's get the headlines usually into it and\nThank you very much Doug I'm running every one president Donald Trump has claimed that

P. I. C. call he's leading Gavin Newsom by like seven\nEight points in the contested congressional districts and the reason that Kevin McCarthy and the result President Trump got behind John Cox even though John Cox was not a Trump supporter and the twenty sixteen presidential race he voted for for Gary Johnson the libertarian candidate\nThey they they made sure to get behind him and get them to push he needed to get on the November ballot so that he would provide protection for those endangered Republican members of Congress\nAnd it appears as if he's actually doing that\nAccording to early voting numbers of Republicans are turning out in in in much bigger numbers than Democrats I'm particularly by the way not just in\nIn California in in some of those congressional districts but in states where the U.S Senate races are on the ballot very very contested US Senate races so so the John Cox a I'm a phenomenon was all about protecting rose vulnerable members of Congress it looks like you might be doing\nMe that was awful years again by sheer demographic one\nTo two times a week on thirty nine seven Ninety K.

government right\nIt is a wealth of potential information that can help you in this investigation\nIncluding all of the packaging and the postage ... delivery methods all their uh what do you make of the fact that these pipe bombs are very simple devices are in their crude is form\nThese at least one of them it seems to have a digital timer on it and again we don't know if this is these are actually even functional bombs at this point they could have just been\nA you know to scare people but if it has a digital component a timer mechanism that would certainly imply a more sophisticated level of a bomb building\n[noise] uh yes um [noise] I I suppose you could do that again that that is a possibility if this scenario look the only people that know at this point uh\nOf the advocacy of these devices that would be the bomb techs and the people directly involved in the investigation everything out speculation people have seen a couple of pictures up of the one that landed at at at CNN that was you know a addressed to\nFormer director Brennan 'em and you can you can for I've already seen I mean there's that you just go on social media and social media is doing what it always does you know you've got you got that hundreds of thousands of people out there with their theories and they're all absolutely convinced that that they are right\nAnd so now suddenly everybody's a bomb tech um I you know I I I don't like while the well the speculation so I I always said look you've got to\nFirst writing but you got to let the investigation play out you've got to get the evidence the facts and then then you can determine voted on to actually have the perpetrator at hand\nAh when you have a case like this and there's so many bombs is it possible that this is the work of a single individual or is it is it possible that this is a some kind of a as a terrorist cell of one form or another\n[laughter] or it could be a you know it could easily be one person uh there's\nThere's nothing that was a possibility look they go back to that\nWhen was the forties and fifties in New York City you had what the case that was referred to as the mad bomber and that was one individual um who was ultimately when he was caught it turns out he was upset with caught at\nA former employer and he was placing pipe bombs all over the city um and it was just one individual uh you've got the Austin bomber where you had numerous packages to ... you know earlier this year down in Texas a one individual or so you know nothing just the number of packages a similarity of all of them\nYou know again it's speculation but\nYou can't rule anything out I guess the could it be multiple individuals could there be some\nWho knows what the motivation and that's that's the dangerous game that we're all thing right everybody wants an answer immediately and if they don't have an answer because the authorities are still working their way through the investigation\nThen they're happy to get on on social media and deliver what they believe is to be their answer it's not helpful and frankly I mean people the interesting part about this not disappeared on a different you know issue rather than just the operational activity here but you look at this and you think\nNow you've got you've got a various politicians who just a week ago were hammering one side or the other\nAnd now they want to get out there and and be self righteous about how you know look you know we ought to be more civil we have to be more you know we have to know everybody politicians on both sides of the aisle pundits on both sides across the political spectrum or anybody with a social media platform of Spencer time hammering one side of the other they're all\nResponsible for the current mood and the current environment and they increasingly aggressive rhetoric everybody is ... has a part to play in this and so am I on\nIt you know the the irritating part is how now everybody wants to back off and act like hey it's not me\nYou know ... years that everybody's nobody gets out of this blameless I guess is what I'm saying and the current involve\nI totally agree with you I couldn't I couldn't agree more I and this has been coming on I mean people want to put this into a to Trump's plate and he'd bears his portion of responsibility certainly as the president but we've been heading down this road for a long time and everybody's got what I called dot com courage\nEverybody's a real tough guy a online\nUh at and what happens then so many people get crazed over so many things that inevitably the unhealthy in the brain will eventually act on it and we've seen that happen Steve's police got shot the Congress a congressional baseball team was nearly a wiped out might have been if not for the\nUh amazingly great work on Capitol Hill police officer who ah was able to take the shooter down before he wiped out a ten percent of a Congress\n... but so you know we've got lunatics all over the place but obviously\nThis was a major operation somebody put a lot of time and effort into either trying to scare a members you know political figures and media figures well John Brennan is an interesting choice John Brennan doesn't actually work at CNN but is there so frequently is the former CIA director\nAnd a severe Trump critic that uh the way Robert Deniro has made himself you know one of the more vulgar show business credit ... not even making a point rather than just saying if the president et cetera [noise]\nAh so whoever sent these out had a real list\nA ... you know we don't know whether or not frankly we don't know whether the bombs were actually functional at this point we just know that they showed up a and a lot of them are and we don't know if there are more of them out there but a lot of them the fact that more showed up today or were discovered today is obviously disturbing\nRight I mean and and and again I think that the danger here is the speed of information the way that technology works nowadays everybody expects and they're pretty demands and the answer immediately investigations don't work that way so the authorities have to step through this and that's what they're doing right now and I I Am very confident\nThat the reason is that are being thrown at this we will identify the individual or individuals who are responsible for people need to to step back I mean I'd love I'd love to see a national you know seven days off from social media everybody gets voluntarily dial off you know what go out and talk to your friends or your contacts write a letter to somebody\nGet off the social media because right you've got the people that remember you pointed out that the shooting at the at the Republican the\nBall field or that it is critically injured or or two or three hundred and ... uh right after that as soon as that happened you had people on on the left side saying no we can't assessed motive yet you have to have to step back you know and and now you those same people jumping to assess motive\nBoth sides are guilty of this ... ... unless you believe in the center and nobody looks at the center anymore\nThen you've got a part to play in this and so I ... I don't know how we get back to it you know and that's a theoretical conversation that maybe doesn't go anywhere\nBut until people move back towards the middle or until we we get rid of social media I don't think we're going to see a return to civility any time in our lives\nAnd we're talking about Mike Baker who's the president of a diligence A L L C diligence dot com a and a former CIA covert ops officer or a ... uh in terms of uh the procedures\nNow what happens to these bombs what ... you know ... well I Know one of them was taken and destroyed but what happens to these bombs I mean\nWhat are you ... what they do is they you know there has to ... there was an onsite assessment right away obviously in terms of the uh\nThe uh the condition the African see that it would be the situation that do you do in terms of the immediate safety that's the first concern you lock it down and you're you're ensure that the public is safe then you ... if if you can every step is taken obviously it's first of all to protect lives then\nEvery step is taken to try and it it it was censored to render the device safe\nAnd not exploded and because again what are you looking for you're looking for maximum evidence and and and exploded a device will still yield I'm a a a surprising amount of of evidence but if you can you rent or it's safe and then you've got a device that that you immediately

Peter how are ya\nHey I'm great how are you doing this morning I'm fine thanks coming on with us appreciate it absolutely so ah what happened\n[noise] well I think what what what people have to recognize when it comes to ... or or welfare fraud um we oftentimes hear the stories of you know the person that's fine lobster clause with their ... and\nWe understand the frustration and and uh the sense of outrage that goes with that but the big problem with the tea fraud um is the fact that you have vendors that are approved by the federal government to\nReceive the bt transmissions even though they jumped to criminal background checks on them and a lot of the biggest fraud in the ... system stems from the fact that there is little federal enforcement of the actual vendors themselves and this is where\nYou get people sometimes running up to seven eight hundred thousand dollars a month sometimes a couple of million dollars a month in fraudulent transactions there's a whole underground market of ... cars that are bought and sold and\nYou know sometimes it even enters into cases where they have found a B team money going to terrorist organizations around the world that\nThat sympathetic people in this country or emigrate communities in this country that are ... are actually funneling back cash to terrorist groups around the world so huge problems the numbers of people that are receiving food stamps is down with a booming economy however the problem of fraud continues in a major way\nUh you know it's we've discussed this many times in the past that if there is a if there's money out there there's always going to be somebody who's gonna job the system\nAh ... I mean that's just the way it is I Would tell the story Peter about uh my high school used to have a a Thanksgiving weekend alumni dance and so all the kids who graduated within the last couple of years with combat meet their friends are in college\nAnd it was five dollars at the door and the guy who ran the thing with skimming the five dollars at the door you know eventually got caught as I get nothing worse than a petty thief you know throw your reputation away for you know two hundred dollars but uh\nEven a year after the treatment the disease was found to be stable to Ninety percent of those treated and it's believed that there was a link between nutrient absorption by the mucus membrane and the small intestine and the development of insulin resistance among people with type ...\nDiabetes astonishing who've I you know I when you read a story like did you hear stories like this you go my brain doesn't work this way\n[laughter] I don't know how come up with how do you think of that I even think of it yeah what thank God there are people who do and uh you know my brother Jeff died from a diabetes at the age of fifty six and it is such a\nA widespread disease including juvenile diabetes hits a scourge my grandfather died too it's a terrible terrible illness and ah it almost seems like there's as many varieties is there are people with it like no two people really seem to have the same has the same impact on them\nBut ah any breakthrough on that and this one could be enormously significant\nThis is interesting this is sort of half a story that Doesn't Suck and I'll tell you what are\nYou know we always assume the teen drivers of the worst drivers on the road the youngest and the oldest drivers of the most dangerous well as it turns out teen drivers are actually safer than people in their twenties\nReally this is a research team heart instructors from in LA driving school to test study participants rating each driver and a scale of one to for the team recruited a hundred eight experience drivers split evenly by gender with an average age of Eighteen\nParticipants took a two hour driving course focusing uncommon driving maneuvers and car control and then took a driving test on the streets of LA city widely viewed as having the worst traffic of the world and made worse by the way with road diets and bad management\nThe research team wanted to analyze the driving scores according to age and gender in particular because of common stereotypes well the results were not what the team was expecting age played a role in driving ability but instead of younger drivers performing worst teams actually outperform their older counterparts almost across the board\nAnd you know this if you think about the kind of believe that I I usually do yeah even though they're inexperienced\nBut I think they're more like scared of it so they're like I'm going to do you have to have you gonna you know do I have to hide barring them with messages yet\nAnd showing them gory accidents and they've just been trained yes presumably well and they're scared so I'm gonna I'm gonna do everything I Know it's a big responsibility I'm going to listen to all the direction\nThey probably also got the threat that uh if you get into one fender bender we're taking away the car\nI think of it all up and now\nWith that said what kills a lot of pilots are becoming complacent you don't do the walk around you know\nCheck your control I've done this a lot I got it so many times you don't check the gas tank to make sure that water as and gotten in their et cetera et cetera the next thing you know a couple you don't go through your chocolate and it's the same thing that happens with drivers you driving for so many years and I tell you\nYou know kick the tires it ... me how many people are texting while driving it really does God\nI don't get to see it that often 'cause I'm mostly doing the driving much to my wife's irritation though you were going to say 'cause you're taxing [laughter] I Can't say I'd never texted while driving but it's very rare because the thing is I'm In confidence when I'm fully focus\nI even I Know that this is a bad idea but when I'm a passenger in the car holy mackerel it's insane it's more I and many times a year at a traffic light you got to blow the horn because the wind the stop online it cannot go for the length of a traffic light without\nGoing to the really scares me is that I catch myself doing it I don't even realize that I'm doing it\nI I Know that's why it should be falling off in the\nCar and you know whereas we're in a big car and you know Christmas driving and I'm In the past year the and he's always like oh my God this person they're either ... or they're doing something they're driving too slow

anything I mean hence the Stormy Daniels defamation of character suit against Donald Trump that got tossed I mean you can file suit over everything but that doesn't mean we have to take it seriously and at some point society has to protect itself\nAnd we've been paralyzed the on this issue and it's tragic it's not serving anybody's purpose\nBut it's still going to take time and money and resources because it's going to have to go to the court says right so in a month or however long this is going to take people are still going to make an anti fish and more rats are going to be

America the twenty sixteen us presidential election causes symptoms often seen in those with post traumatic stress disorder the research led by psychology professor Melissa Hagen from San Francisco State University and published Monday in the journal of American college health\nWas based on a survey of students at Arizona State university and twenty Seventeen each student filled out a psychological assessment called the impact of events scale with questions tailored to the twenty sixteen election\nThe results show that twenty five percent showed clinically significant levels of stress based on the election with women scoring about forty five percent higher than men and Democrats going more than two and a half times higher than Republicans well [noise]\nI don't know what to say about this or that say about your kids when you were younger\nOh he was he said the size of a look this was a very turbulent election but uh the reason people are having this ... ... and it was I I Will acknowledge that this election the twenty sixteen election I'm Talking about\nThe election of Donald Trump in many ways was without precedent so therefore uh we had a both in terms of ah the people who were jubilant Lee happy Donald Trump won and suicidal be depressed that he won a is not surprising\nBecause he's a very unusual figure he's not somebody that you can look through the pages of history and find an easy analogy people keep pointing to Andrew Jackson I ... that's the closest but even that's a country mile apart\nBut even Trump's craziness aside everyone expected that he would not with\nIncluding his own team he didn't think he was good that they didn't think they were going to win so that's so that's the only reality well you see we you know I ... that can be as a little bit of a fire well where we diagnose a lot of things this is how we're out into the drugs that are self\nProjecting I think the TSA 'cause their self assessing ... and again\nA part of this goes back to my hobby horse which is the lack of historical context for anything that we are talking about when you stop teaching history\nOr you teach it haphazardly than when an event happens people freak out like it's the you know the end of the world and you got to put things into context and we don't because if you if every day you wake up\nIt's a new world for you and you have no way of placing current events within the context of the arc of history\nThen you're gonna look react to everything I think the world is on fire right and I can tell you in my lifetime I can point to a couple of world on fire day September eleventh two thousand one there's one yeah\nOkay but there are many bombs have been dropped on the you know there are many you know JFK being murdered that was a biggie Martin Luther king being murdered that was a big you man landing on the moon that was a biggie\nUh but you know a lot of the other stories or just a ... either a\nInflated for political purposes or just over hyped for ratings purposes [noise]\nAll right I mean his partner NBC for reports a series of public service announcements were unveiled in orange county this week to assure immigrants living in the country illegally\nThat law enforcement will not arrest them if they report a crime or victims of a crime Orange County and to share thing candidate for sheriff down Barnes addressed the issue at a news conference at the Mexican consulates office in Santa Ana\nSaying any indication that department enforces immigration law quote\nSends a dangerous message to the community and the roads trust in law enforcement Duke uh when who is running for sheriff against Barnes argued quote this PSA is just another example of the departments reactive policy we need to be proactive and make sure our communities trust our Orange County sheriff's\nWell you know uh the uh we've been doing this for years San Francisco or used to put ads on bus benches and on the sides of municipal buses advertising that there were a sanctuary city\nSo it's not surprising sanctuary cities make no secret of the fact that there were sanctuary city and all this goes back to special order forty signed back in Nineteen Seventy nine by then LAPD chief Daryl Gates who is far from was far from a liberal\nHe was about as far from a liberal as it's possible to get and the theory on sanctuary cities was that people who are in the country illegally are are victims of crime disproportionally because criminals know that they won't come forward and report their victimization for fear of deportation and if there are witnesses to crime\nThey are reluctant to come forward and testify for fear of any contact with the judicial system that it will end trap them and they get deported so special order forty was one of those road hell's paved with good intentions we put a special order for it which is not a law by the way it's a department directed\nA and the idea was that this will encourage people in the country in Los Angeles specifically illegally to cooperate\nWith law enforcement and we'll get the really bad players that worked out well it hasn't worked out that problem in the aftermath look what happened after Nineteen Seventy nine we saw and it's not all on this but it certainly is a major component of it\nWe had the drug explosion and the gang infestation and people were still not coming forward the cooperative testified because they were afraid if not of deportation they're afraid of retribution yup uh getting on the wrong side of the gangs\nSo a crime spiraled it's skyrocketed reaching a date facts into the mid to late Nineteen nineties uh\nSo it it there's no ...

the four or five or the Ninety One or the sixty or whatever you're on right now which is probably a parking lot\nYou're you're thinking to yourself is this going to change ever and what I just said about Gavin Newsom you know he's getting all this money from all these interest groups who are wedded to keeping things the way they are because the way things are\nWith lousy schools that are forty sevens in the nation water rationing coming in twenty twenty to\nThe highest taxes the most homeless the highest poverty rate all of these things are the way they are because somebody in Sacramento likes them that way and they're making money from them that way that it's no accident\nAnd of course their funding Gavin Newsom to the hilt so that he can get into office and keep things the way they are for these groups and that's what's got to change because the state is absolutely wonderful with a great weather and everything else we have here but\nWe've just got a lousy is political management 'cause as you said it's one party rule that keeps themselves going well\n... it's we have every possible blessing an advantage that land could want\nTo prosper a we have as you mentioned great whether we are poised on the Pacific rim and the era of a of the uh the China Dream yeah ah we have major and astonishingly brilliant colleges and universities have a world class a infrastructure\nIn terms of ports and harbors we've got all of that stuff's going for us\nAnd there are people obviously who are prospering astonishing you see these houses two hundred and forty million dollar mega stay high but the ... but but it's become a third world where we've lost the middle we've lost the middle are politically and economically and and that's something that rarely gets talked about but\nYou know the middle class I I've always argued that you can't find any place on earth in any ethic of history\nThat when they lose the economic and political center you would want to live there because now you have wild pendulum swings from far right the far left and back again well right now we're in a in a swing where Republicans pretty much need endangered species status\nOr and and it's very hard for the folks in Sacramento to blame all of our problems on Washington it's not all Washington a lot of his decisions that are made locally\nYou know we always say everything is relative right and it's happening now in the rest of the country you you I traveled to other parts of the country not recently but I've been to other parts of the country in the last couple of years\nAnd people are actually doing really pretty well in in the other parts of the country most people are employed black and Hispanic unemployment is at record lows people are working all around the country and are actually having great lives in Texas you know they're doing wonderfully\nHere however people are employed but you have this ... you know I just did a TV hit and I was talking to the make up person I was talking to the sound engineer it's talk of the people that are there at the studio working and trying to make a go of things and there's this ... you know people are working there got a job\nBut they don't feel like they're getting ahead in California they don't feel like they have a a wonderful lifestyle because they're crammed into a tiny apartment they're paying too many\nTwo thousand dollars a month for or they're paying five dollars for gasoline or one of the people in at the station was telling me they they saw station I suppose that that was it over five dollars a gallon for gasoline\nAnd they're saying in themselves while it's great to live here with this wonderful weather but if I have to work two jobs and I have no savings at the end of the day and\nYou know I'm scrambling to fill my tank or you know you have a restaurant meal is it worth it yeah\nYeah we're talking with John Cox who was a governor of for the state of California of course ah and if you want to join this by the way eight hundred to two KBC we're going to happen for the bottom of the hour I'm John one of the things that's come up a number of times on some of the other topics that we've talked about\nIn odd ways but it all comes back to what I think is a real significant issue\nWe would for instance we're talking about how younger people are skeptical of vaccines and it's not their anti actors uh it's uh that that they've grown up without the threat of pandemics right you know we\nMay be actually solve a lot of the problems so now they just the lady that's a big thing but the but that stuff doesn't just happen right but at the same time we're also seeing people who are paranoid that the vaccines are damaging and they don't believe the experts\nAnd we've got these bombs that have been sent out and there are people coming up a conspiracy theories on who's behind the bombings\nAnd we're seeing the homeless crisis in and even here in liberal Los Angeles on the west side near riots from constituents who don't want homeless shelters built in their district and it all comes down to we don't trust government even when it's our own government even when it's run by people we voted for\nAnd let's give an example of that you know there was this whole big thing about the H. P. V. virus which is the human capital and loan or whatever it was\nAnd we found out that that was sponsored by some drug company to some extent who paid off a bunch of legislators to spread the word around that you needed this thing and you had to vaccinate teenage girls you know who might have sex and all this kind of stuff\nAnd it was created all this ginned up worry and of course what was happening it was just this company was going to make a lot of money from getting government to require this vaccine\nAnd a lot of parents said no I don't want this vaccine I don't want to you know I'm I'm worried about measles whooping cough but this one you know I'm not that worried about and we find out later that it was all about profit\nBecause the legislators it's sold themselves basically ... to this ... company\nI think it circles back to the fact that we don't trust our public officials in Aurora because we know that they just raised money to put thirty second TV ads on TV\nAnd they're telling us what what what they think we want to hear\nBut what they're really doing is taking money on the side from all these companies that want something done in Sacramento\nAnd we just don't trust them anymore and an ... I I'm running to try to build that trust back again I've I'm I'm going to have a proposal you know day one to to reform the structure of this so that we don't have these these fundraisers anymore\nOr how do we do that because you know a Jessie Unruh the former or simply speaker many moons ago here in California\nAre created the great aphorism ... money is the mother's milk of politics right uh and and I'm not naive at that costs money to run at ... I mean this isn't New Hampshire where you can go out and shake hands with literally every resident of the state of New Hampshire\nRight our foreign yeah you've got major metropolitan areas expensive media monitor it\nIs a way to get this to look like New Hampshire and we're going to talk about it on November seven I'm Sorry to be that way because there's only so much that people can digest between now and November sick so I think people need to understand that I'm\nGoing to correct the gas tax I'm going to correct the housing shortage by building affordable housing and then I'm going to tackle this reform and try to talk to people about getting California to have a structure that's more like New Hampshire but I'm not going to do that now I'm going to wait until November seventh because it's just too much to to go into\nIs there anything you can do about the Boston Red Sox by the way [laughter] now only Dodger fans\nAre I Know I Know have hired a they just won the first two games I mean there's there's plenty of games left in that series there's at least five games possible a so there's there's the chance\nOr John Cox for governor dot com by the way is the campaign website and you can go there and see John's various positions on the issues and of course the election is Tuesday November ...\nDevices sent a high profile Democrats and critics of the president were found in New York today one was addressed the actor Robert Deniro who drop the bomb several times as he criticized President Trump all appearing at the Tony Award there earlier this year corresponded Boston teeny reports\nOn Fox and friends White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defending the president's continued focus of blame on the media for the suspected bombs sent the public figures and CNN he often criticizes at rallies and in tweets\nOne percent of the coverage about the president is negative to fight the historic successes when the ideas are perpetuated\nAnd continues negativity that is not helpful for the American course\nThe president has not focused any blame themselves for the current state of American discourse only saying it is Wednesday night rally he was behaving nicely Bob Costas teeny Washington\nA white supremacist leader from Huntington Beach has been arrested by the FBI and faces federal charges for allegedly inciting racial violence in several cities across the U.S\nRobert run do was denied bail at a hearing in the LA federal court the FBI says he was arrested in Sunday at LAX to other members of the rise above movement\nTyler law of Redondo Beach and Robert Bowman uh Torrance were taken into custody Wednesday on suspicion of inciting violence in Charlottesville, Virginia Huntington Beach San Bernardino in Berkeley fourth suspect was also charged but remains at large I'm Jeff ...
