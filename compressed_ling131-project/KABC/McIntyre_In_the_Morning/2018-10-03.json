fourteen thankfully an\nWe told you about this study from the ... Center for food policy and obesity at the University of Connecticut\nThey polled roughly eight hundred parents in twenty ten Thirteen and sixteen regarding what they had ordered from the nation's fourth largest fast food chains McDonalds Burger King Wendy's and subway for their kids\nAges two three eleven in the past seven days so you get it it's what parents order for their kids ages ... to ... from the four biggest fast food places and what they found was an astonishing kind of leap\nA in how much fast food we're buying for our kids a Seventy nine percent increase\nUp from a twenty tend to talk about it right now is uh the lead author of this study and it's a pleasure to welcome to the show Dr Jennifer Harris Dr Harris a warrior\nOn tape thanks for having me\nI appreciate it uh some of the questions that I ask undoubtedly are ... are not covered by your study but but I I'd be interested in your your opinions on this anyway we've discussed is\nUh in the context of all of the consciousness raising a health related and safety related issues that we've seen smoking for instance we've not only\nAh been running the essays for fifty years but we've passed a lot of laws either a hiking taxes are just making it more difficult to where you can and can't smoke\nAh drinking and driving and we've had a significant impact on human behavior in those areas\nOther things like for instance texting and driving or drug consumption not so successful but this one is really peculiar because there is no secret about what we're doing with our diets in in in the first world a it was an American problem it's becoming a global problem\nAnd yet despite all of this uh information that has been made available we're seeing the results that you found in your study [noise]\nWell I think that it's like a couple of things going on here one is um [noise] well fast food is really convenient it's really cheap and kids love it so for parents it's a you know it's an easy solution but\nDid not getting that the companies are doing it's also playing a huge draw because suddenly ask parents what they what they think a lot of there's a misperception among a lot of parents\nNow that fat to kids meals are healthy options and the reason they think that is because a lot of the restaurants\nHad introduced healthier drink than healthier side like\nA hundred percent juice and ... and apple slices um the rest of the meal is still on how the evening chicken nuggets are so high in sodium and high in fat but they've made a big deal about the healthy options now and because of that parents\nThink these are these tests that kid's meal to actually good for their kids and when they think that that they're more likely to take their kids to the restaurants so it's really a brilliant marketing tactic on the part of the fast food company\nAnd now one of the things that California did was a couple of years ago we pass this law that says if you're a franchise and I don't remember how many uh franchise or locations you have to have to fall into this but ah you have to put the calorie counts on your menus\nAnd I'll tell you some had an a from the moment that this started showing up places it really did have an impact on what I order when I go out because it's right in front of you and to me it's just information and then as a consumer you can make your own choices but when I go in and I see something's got like Nineteen hundred calories\nRealized you know it's almost a full day's recommended caloric intake in one fell swoop sugar yeah maybe I Will not orders that\nWell that is actually at a national law now so\nIt I wasn't aware that as a federal law yeah yeah so\nUm so\nIt's great that the rest of the restaurants that have to provide that information I'm\nActually California just on the governor just signed a law requiring kids meals in California to include a healthy drink automatically which is another great way to sort of encourages parents to get the the healthier choices but\nThe problem is that that that still\nIs not um [noise] it's not um it has many calories too much fat too much sodium came much sugar but um parents\nOnly three thousand five

president did yes and it makes it hard to ignore he was at one of his campaign style rallies this one in Mississippi\nAnd I decided to go there after having been really by Donald Trump standard sensational on the topic talking about how he found Christine Blasey Ford to be credible and a a nice person and basically staying out of it because\nThis is a incredibly important story and in very emotional story and it's a significant moment for his administration because this is a cream court nomination in trouble so he hasn't been pouring gas on the fire\nUntil yesterday when he ran around with a gas can and talked about how difficult it is for boys girls are doing great and then said this\nThirty six years this I\nThink it was it was one of ... how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where it was like I don't remember how many [noise]\n\n[noise] well I don't know I might add one\nSaturday\nSo ah it's not helpful [noise] it doesn't help or act it doesn't help advance the Kavanaugh case now all of those questions by the way about the gaps\nIn Christine Blasey Ford story are totally legitimate questions this is one of the reasons why it's surprising that the FBI has not spoken to her\nA sense the FBI investigation was reopened they apparently interviewed mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh on a bunch of other people but they haven't talked to her\nReally weird it is very they haven't talked to her no apparently not talk to the second accuser yeah off the main one right at\nAnd you know a U.S specifically on those points about when where and why you know et cetera but for the president to turn it into a campaign rally rallying cry to whip the crowd into a frenzy\nAnd does all of the discipline that he had been invoking to stay out of this and let the process play itself out it's crunch time can't you hang on for at least a couple more days yeah\nThey don't allow the Republican senators have hired a prosecutor to make sure that they didn't look bad asking her those kinds of questions yet in the hearing right yeah yeah Trump just did undid all that yeah I was like an ... of\nCourse yeah it's just they just couldn't help and all kind of giving back to the doctor for why wouldn't I don't I ... in\nLess to her the Democratic waiting to speak to her life that they'd done they may be done the Democrats\nAre asking for the instructions that the FBI got from the White House the ... with the suspicion that they may have been told not to talk to her a because it doesn't seem on the surface to make any sense a why would\nYou not investigate the woman the reason why we're here having an investigation doesn't make sense to me so many questions that I feel like need to be answered yep\nUm so anyway and that is wow and we'll get into this later on the uh the New York times did they speak that Kavanaugh\nYes yeah they ... they ... they have not taught our I gosh okay that's the so we are to the New York times published a huge Fifteen thousand word or investigative report yesterday\nGoing into the forensics of the Trump family empire using two hundred thousand documents that they obtained going back through Fred Trump Donald Trump's father's a financial dealings including tax returns for all these show companies\nThey got dads taxes and as you know a part of the mythology of uh the art of the deal and the whole Trump Donald Trump a sort of a you know financial genius is based upon the fact that he got a million dollar loan from his father they paid back with interest and that's it\nWell as it turns out Donald Trump owned apartment buildings when he was eight\nYears old who have been the millionaire just on the payroll van\nOr that the the forensics of this are really kind of astonishing uh and the likelihood that there was massive tax fraud committed is very very high now again it all maybe statute of limitations stuff\nUh but the allegations it's along read but it's really pretty eye opening but if nothing else it it is certainly indicates what I've always suspected that the reason Donald Trump will never make his tax returns a publicly available is that it would put the truth to the lie\nThat this financial empire of his is propped up\nBy essentially accounting chicanery\nUh and and possibly more but again that's totally speculative and acknowledge it speculate because we don't have the documents\nBut boy oh boy oh boy Trump's parents left their children more than a billion dollars which would have resulted in roughly five hundred and fifty million dollars\nIn tax as a tax bill because there was a fifty five percent tax at that time inheritance tax ah but the trumps paid a total of fifty two point two million basically five percent\nOr Charles Harder by the way an attorney for Donald Trump said in a statement that the times allegations of tax evasion are quote one hundred percent false and he said that Trump had virtually no involvement with the tax strategies used by his family what she said were carried out by professional tax advisors I find that impossible\nTo believe I find it impossible to believe that the the that Donald Trump had you know a ... no involvement whatsoever in the tax strategy for his own company and his own family finances but you know that's the story as of now All right ladies and\nGentleman speaking of taxes or the national debt jumped by one point to ...\nAnd the fiscal year twenty Eighteen it was a time when uh the Republican Party any way actually used to talk about a fiscal responsibility and deficits but now it

California's drought that there were X number of people that until they turn on the tap and dust comes out of their faucet they don't take the drought seriously\nOr some do but a lot don't and I think that that's kind of what's happened with the deficits because conservatives have been yelling about deficits for fifty years\nAnd yet everything's still keeps running and you know keeps you moving on and uh we've been talking about the LA city problems in the state of California with unfunded pension liability is union everybody's check keeps coming in and I just fear that until the thing

was a little higher but then with the Congress dramatically cut the debt it was responsible after World War two and a paid it back down\nThe problem now is you know we haven't been to one attempt your

station\n[noise] have you seen is led them locally seven o'clock morning everyone on land pleading President Trump held a rally in Mississippi and brought up the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford for the first time yesterday a casting teeny has\nThere was a serious tax fraud involved in how Fred Trump's taxes with the uh uh a parrot active involvement of Donald Trump and his family members and his siblings\nOr participate in the New York times allegations of course being denied a by the Trump family through a lawyer Charles Jay harder\nWho said that this is one hundred percent false and highly defamatory or\nBut meanwhile uh the the the data the documents appear to be legitimate and ah the tax department or is now reviewing this certainly both New York state and the IRS\nThe or the federal a revenue services the Internal Revenue service is going to have no choice but to start looking into these allegations the president gets this wages garnished [noise]\nWell I'll tell you something uh this is more than a wage garnish you know a lot of ... again we're dealing with stuff from many years ago so let's Donald Trump when his father died\nHis father died in Nineteen Ninety nine oh okay so he was so he was way man right okay but\nWe got along these allegations are from the nineties\nBut it's it's a seat and this is where it's above my uh I mean I barely understand my own taxes so I'm not going to try to go to Mary ... so yeah but if it's sort of seems to have work like this\nThat are in order to beat inherited taxes and to beat taxes Fred Trump would put ownership of apartment buildings in his kids name\nAnd ah this started when Donald Trump was like eight years old at the age of aid he was the owner of apartment buildings and and receive salary ... because he was listed as the receiver of the rent is that one from the people do I bet it's what they do\nYou find any way to make sure you have to get your money and the government\nAnd that you don't get taxed I I'm In the rich have to figure out ways to spread that money out that's what they do it\nAnd that's one of the things that makes this story so complex because tax law\nVaries from state to state and it's complicated and when you have big interests there's all kinds of expenses written off but in some of the cases here there seems to be outright money laundering where there were show corporations that were created to buy\nA maintenance supplies for the apartment buildings but apparently there were no maintenance supplies ever purchased they would just\nA essentially inflated or invoices created for things that had already been purchased right uh so that's where you get into outright a fever and yeah I mean tax fraud now what's going to be done about it have no idea\nThe reason I'm bringing up if you want to read it of course the New York times uh pieces on line it's a long read\nA and there are people like I said more qualified than I Am to kind of walk through the thicket of allegations and we'll try to get somebody on a could explain this both of legitimate portions of it and the illegitimate portions of it but\nWhat it does too is what I've always thought was the central issue that started the whole train of events with Mueller investigation and Russian collusion and all that stuff is why wouldn't candidate Trump and then President Trump release his tax returns\nAnd still hasn't and nobody even ass\nAnymore because you know now that he's been president for over a year there's been another year's income taxes where\nTraditionally we get the president's tax returns to for the president and first lady usually released their tax returns George W. Bush and Laura Bush did it the Obamas did it the Clintons even did it and back it goes through time in the modern era anyway\nUh this has been sort of a pro forma thing that we've done for basically the last fifty years and this president didn't do it and we're originally\nTold that he couldn't do it during the campaign because he was subject to an audit he was undergoing an audit we know that that's not true in other words being the subject of an audit does not preclude somebody from releasing their own tax returns\nHe stepped on that whole thing by using his taxes as a bargaining chip saying if Hillary releases or emails I'll release\nMy taxes which clearly showed that he understood that he there was nothing stopping them from releasing his taxes except his own a decision making because he chose not to have them release well now there's not even a discussion of it anymore I just went away\nBut the thing is I've always believed if there was a scandal to be had it's not going to be from Russian collusion it's not going to be that you know Vladimir Putin had put a microchip and Donald Trump's head so that they'd have a man ... as far as the United states\nThat it was going to be a two fold one\nFinancial ... around the ... in the way the Trump family enterprise was run or something as benign but significant for a guy like Donald Trump which is that is simply not as wealthy as he has built a legend and claims to be and the tax returns would indicate that\nAh but but the problem about not releasing the tax returns is it opened up\nA ... it opened up speculation because when you hide something that everybody else who's run for office has released\nIt ... then you open you invite people to start trying to come up with conspiracy theories as to why is this why when he released his taxes when everybody else's run for president has done that and not just for president by the way it will run for\nSenate for Congress you know for a you know a lower level officers frequently release their\nFinancial statements\nSo that uh the public knows whether or not they have any kind of conflicts of interest\nOr or whether they've been paying their fair share if you're going to pass laws that can impose taxes on people we have a right as a people to know whether or not even paying your taxes it doesn't seem like an unreasonable position\nA for for the American people to have that information\nBut the bottom line here is is that now a ... there's going to be a lot of people looking at it hit the finances because the the there's hundreds of thousands of pages of documents that certainly tell a very different story than we've been told over many many years\nOf by the president and by the entrepreneur Donald Trump before he was in politics\nAre and some of the stuff is you know I don't know whether or not it's prosecutor bowl but it certainly could be a ... the the IRS\nOr as we all know has a very very long memory now the Trump I Want to be as fair as possible here the Trump family position as a we filed our taxes\nAre and it pass muster with New York state and with the federal government all these years and that's true so or if there was a large scale tax fraud going on a fair question might be well you'd\nThink they'd be wide and find out that shit yeah why didn't somebody be investigating by now raise an eyebrow on\nThis this must be one of those might be one of those things where it's just up to the line of criminality\nWell that was always my feeling about the Clintons for instance or the Clintons would find out and I used to say this back in the day when a you know Bill Clinton was president\nThat the ethics of the Clintons seemed to be let's find out what the line is of criminality and get as close to it as humanly possible\nUh and and you know inevitably what happens if you're living a big act of life and that's your operating a F house sooner or later you're going to tumble across the line\nUh but with the trumpet a\nFamily business and remember he said and I think it was very truthful while he was candidate Trump that the red line for him was going into the family finances that that's something that he would not tolerate I mean he said it very clearly\nAh so I you know one of the questions that I have is weird\nOf course where did all these documents come from and I have to wonder remember when we talked about\nUh the uh the president's accountant or cut a deal with prosecutors mhm you have to wonder whether or not this didn't come on the other one that worked with daddy right yes the guy that's been around for a long long time right why so bird has been there for thirty plus years\nAnd going back to when Fred Trump was running the operation\nAnd you do have to wonder whether or not that's the 'cause everyone always said well Michael Cohen's guy knows where the bodies are ... now Michael Cohen's been there for ten years this guy's been there for Thirty years and he's the one who had the checkbook\nSo he knows what the finances are and if he felt like I could go to jail then maybe that's how some documents God's shifted over to the New York times anyway uh so this has to be continued a meanwhile\nWe'll get all the bad news out of the way a early the president was in Mississippi yesterday doing one of his campaign\nA rallies and you know we have teleprompter Trump and then we have Trump Trump and uh we have noted how\nModerate the president has been in his comments about Christina ah Christine Blasey Ford since the allegations came forward she came forward their allegations about Brett Kavanaugh now he's defended Kavanaugh's you would expect him to do which is\nA actually this well coming up a week from friday friday October twelve\nOr the official for ever

Orange County cumulus station [noise]\n\n... always happy to have your brain wrap around any\nWell it could use some help us morning so let's start again with net neutrality now we know that the FCC or change the net neutrality laws and what did they what what did they do\n[noise] well they were Richard ... is our laws as proposed and ship that we're supposed to go into effect basically said the Internet is free it's ferrets everybody is nobody should have preferred status nobody\nShould be in a position to what they call ... bandwidth which is either slow website up or ... or or or ... speed it up or slow it down based on the fact that someone was going to pay a ... fee like a let's say a start up start up gets on the Internet\nThey have a product is really cool stuff but because they're not paying an Internet service provider as much as someone else\nThey wouldn't really have preferred status they would be kind of like less appealing attractive consumers 'cause they loaded slower\nThere was an issue with one of the ISPs and I'm I'm not sure which one\nWhere they were had something that was competing with Netflix and their service was faster and Netflix showed up slower or because they didn't like this competition with Netflix they wanted to be a little bit more appealing and\nUm so the FCC originally under the previous administration said this is not right it's the whole concept of the Internet has to be open and free and fair and everybody gets a shot\nAnd uh so as a result they said we're going to have this thing called net neutrality and it was quite an issue uh and in fact in the Senate if you're a member Al Franken was the leader of the net neutrality for uh he he was very concerned about consolidation in the industry was concerned about people getting favored nation status\nSo it was supposed to have on the new FCC comes in and goes up looks like a regulation smells like a regulation we don't want a regulation but was one of those regulations that wasn't supposed to be a regulation\nAnd as a result they said no no I don't want to do it they held hearings there were a lot of strange issues the they claim there was a denial of service attack\nThere wasn't they finally admitted later that there wasn't a there were issues of people who were dead who were actually making comments against neutrality a\nAnd several people who were children of stars who passed away came forward and said my mother or my father has been\nDead for a decade how could they be making comments on the net neutrality rules so it was an emotional thing anyway so now there's no net neutrality the state of California has stood up again\nJust like with the British notification law there is no national breach suffocation on the United states\nBut California was the first just started now there were a fifty two separate jurisdictions still don't have a national outrage notification law but California's activism cause every other state in the union to say you know what\nThat doesn't fly with us with climate change right California stood up and said no we're going to stay where as far as we're concerned we're going to honor their powers or ... even if the United states doesn't want\nTo know but now here's the question now ah ah the the Internet doesn't stop at the border with Arizona and Nevada that is correct so and so what impact can\nThis law that Jerry Brown signed actually have\nWell first of all as a trend setter and companies that wish to do business and operate\nWith the state of California\nThey pay attention to this\nAnd there will be other states that will probably do the same thing the goal that California has a really is ultimately a to say that if you're a California company a ... a net neutrality is going to be the rule as opposed to not the rule and I'm\nThinking of it as a trend setter think of it as a statement think of it as the fact that a lot of other statements of the country may a comeback in line with what California was because a lot of people were very upset about the FCC's move\nUh their shoe we're back with the same uh the same conflict that we've had in so many issues it's a matter of the supremacy clause that you know obviously the constitution and talking with the Federal Communications commission but by common consent we've had the FCC\nFor many many moons and we'd given the power over things like radio and television and cable and executive censored cetera\nAnd the Internet's falling into their purview as well and if again if California can supersede federal regulations then why can't a county decide that we don't like the law that Sacramento past or a city so we don't like the law that the county passed and it becomes chaos\nWell let me throw this up after the FCC was climbing that what the prior FCC had done they didn't really have the authority to do so if you don't have the authority to do what the FCC was trying to do originally then\nHow do you have the authority to supersede the state of California\nThat's a good question that's why this is going to be a fun lawsuit isn't it [laughter]\nWhich are as and you know\nAgain uh we have seen the federal government in the past few years uh taking the position that any regulation is a bad regulation whatever it is that we should deregulate anything and everything we can get our hands on\nWe've seen them do it to the consumer financial Protection Bureau we've seen them do it to the environmental protection agency we've seen them do it\nA with a variety of other entities and agencies across the country so they were just continuing to do their thing and how do we make the world a better place for Comcast and varieties and an Eighteen the and the like as opposed to when you're talking about the Internet\nHow do we leave it free and open and fair where everybody gets a shot and we are encouraging\nInnovation and encouraging new young companies to step up and actually communicate and offer all sorts of different options that alternatives\nWe're talking with Adam love in his book by the way it's called swiped how to protect yourself in a world full of scammers fissures and identity thieves and it's available wherever you get your books these days in in any form a head can I switch gears real quick I Want to pick your brain on another topic that's breaking today because\nWe know that are at eleven Eighteen this morning\nWe're all supposed to get a text to our phones as a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed that's what the message will say\nAnd if we're supposed to be a presidential alert and people who are vendetta shape than it's Donald Trump tweeting to us but it's ... it's my understanding that this was actually a plan that was instituted during the Obama administration I've got a New York times piece going back to a twenty eleven\nOr talking about this that we may get text messages from Brock Obama it's just taken a long time to roll it out and the idea I guess is that you know in the old days of course we had the test of the emergency broadcasting system we have that irritating sound that we've all broadcast a million times in our lives and our careers doing this\nAnd we've always heard but because so many people now are getting their information via the phone that this is just simply an opt dating for a in the event of a national emergency or just using the the new way of communicating a ... a new technology\nI have no problem with what they're doing today I said and you know I'm certainly outspoken about how I feel about certain people in the ...\nBut the truth is that what they're doing there's nothing wrong with it in fact they should every so often do we live with amber alerts we live or of a lot of other alerts that are very important well when you're testing the national emergency system\nIt's critical that you do this and and therefore I don't know why anybody should get bent out of shape with it and certainly you and I both remember the sound that was annoying as Jim Carrey sounding dumber and dumber [laughter]\nSo yeah well you know I I Do think that the reaction to this there are a tiny handful of people are sort of a libertarian objection that uh the government has no right to take over my phone for twelve seconds but a above and beyond that I think what's mostly fueling it is because the test is coming on ...\nAnd they're just smiling they're just all sitting there and total silence smiling and then he realized they were from the Danish navy that not one\nWord of English math or anything along so that's what it would be like performing to a whole room full of jazz hand applause they didn't get one where do you know All right it's nine
