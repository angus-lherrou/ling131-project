Lawrence June cheap economist at the national association of real chores Lawrence welcome to real estate today\nAnd Steven thanks for having me on the show\nWe're so glad you're here so Lawrence of late summer early autumn decline in existing home sales\nHappening here the mortgage rate\nWhen you're a high was in all that some people are getting squeezed out because of the higher rates\nNow some of the buyers will just we set their mind set maybe lower the price point at which states well into the market but the initial phase of rising rate so is that some people are just getting squeezed out and consequently themselves\nAt five point one five million unit pay\nThe latest Mart will be the lowest in nearly three years\nAnd was it also a year over year declined Lawrence\nHere over here to decline a and they use for toys are rising up and he's very small incremental increases\nBut as an Victorian craze is providing some hope for buyers with an iced out\nNow able to see more choice as to possibly enter the market in the upcoming nuts but keep in mind that in September there were some cells down in South Korea jam up because of the hurricane and back\nAnd we will have to wait to see how that gets resolved because generally speaking a natural disaster if that is a negative ads up this week I was but down the recovery space people began to buy homes wants to stay alive\nInteresting well Lawrence yes it is a tough market for buyers out there by prices are up four point two percent year over year that's great for homeowners and home sellers record\nHigh in terms of net worth for the country a combination of the stock market I Know the stock market as little wobbly at times about one compares to one year ago it is higher\nCompared to two or three years ago substantially higher soda and then you combine that with the middle class well which is tied to housing so with home prices wise him a great benefit for middle class homeowners but we need to a shirt that homeownership rate not remain just press levels\nBut with infants who are beginning to show up on the price growth around ... percent range rather than in the upper single digits\nAgainst you provide some opportunity for people to enter the market and the economy is creating jobs and we generally find that as the economy creates jobs even told them selves may decline initially because of the interest rate\nIncreases the buyers will resume back into the market with greater inventory choices\nMore as you mentioned that the hurricanes down south affected home sales but every part of the country was down except the Midwest and they were flat so it was a very tough month\nThat it was the most affordable vision of the country held steady while the U.S Jim based on affordable conditions prices have gone up too high too fast and the west regime continues to struggle in terms of buying activity\nNorth east all modest decline but the Midwest showing civilization is implying that us unless there's jobs and affordable condition as the buyers are willing to make that Dick major purchase for home\nI see well Lawrence let me ask you this does it seem to you then with all the challenging head wins at the buyers are facing in today's market some of them might just be waiting for the spring market of two thousand Nineteen\nNow some may be waiting for mortgage rate to retreat back down\nWill be a false hope in my opinion because mortgage rate is clearly on a wide path probably this time next year maybe five and a half percent mortgage rate average from current\nPoint eight percent and when I look at the past historical housing cycles\nWhen there was a job creation and mortgage rate increase partly due to job creation or the economy improving with a mortgage rate increase because up job creation there were a few months where he sells declined\nBut that virus came back so it remains to be soon whether it's springtime the buyers will resume\nAs the economy without a doubt is in good shape\nStrong job creation wages now picking up the number of people filing for unemployment check at historic lows so economic data is very positive we make sure that translates into increase how is ...\nInteresting when Lawrence says you and I have talked throughout the year it seems that it's just been kind of either flat or down for much of two thousand Eighteen so by the time we hit the end of the year what do you think uh down near\nThe home sales what the down about three percent prices up four to five percent so one can call it you know is it a down here are set up your\nWhole sales of this treaty but foreign fighters continue to increase\nSomehow the housing market for a great\nRecession ten years ago\nThen I quite strong recovery in the recent past years before being more neutral [noise] a lot stronger look moving up or down either way in twenty eight Chang and twenty nine ten I think that two conflicting forces job creation as positive for housing\nOr rising rates are not and those two factors may castle each other out so that home so they're not really changed that much\nBut for the buyers will mean more inventory choices\nAnd I want to point out something you just said which is just so true whether the year ends up up or down depends on the kind of real estate you're doing\nSo hard time really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about the

maybe unique cash click click not just can't stop\nThe market so I think you do need a financial planner but you can go buy it straight out of the online and buy it from a trade or anywhere else\nIt's

blacks can be accessed their ... that you would end up buying somewhere around Thirteen thousand shares\nOkay they're currently paying six point six percent he'd get thirty three thousand class\nAnd get it I see so Cynthia that's pretty comparable investing in a region or a brick and mortar property except the brick and mortar property would be more work\nThe ups and downs of repairs collecting

back again now with our special show retiring wealthy exploring\nYour options as you approach the day you leave the office behind for good as we've discussed on today's show real estate might be able to play a significant role in your retirement\nAnd even though that can happen in different ways the goal is the same and that is to create passive income a revenue stream that you can count on in your retirement\nSo let's wrap up this hour of the show by looking at some of the way he's real estate can help make that happen but before we do remember you should always talk with your financial planner and your account before you make any financial move and that's especially important if you're talking about the retirements strategy\nOf course one way many people generate extra income and their retirement years is to buy a residential property and then rent it out\nThat can be a great strategy but to make it truly lucrative direct would have to be over and above the mortgage the taxes the insurance the maintenance and the condo or age away fees if there are any\nAnd of course you also have to consider potential vacancies\nThere's no guarantee you'll find a renter for the property but in most cases residential real estate is a good investment that could generate a nice additional income stream for your retirement talk to your real chore about the opportunities for getting started investing\nAnother option of course is to invest in real estate investment trust there are a lot less complicated you don't have to worry about qualifying for a mortgage and there's no finding a tenant collecting rent or dealing with vacancies real estate investment trust work just like the stock market\nYou invest in a company that owns lots of real estate\nAnd so in effect you are a real estate investor but you're not a landmark\nAgain talk to your accountant and financial planner about which real estate investment trust might produce the types of returns you hope to get in retirement\nAnd there's one more way that real estate can help you generate income and your retirement years and that is seller held financing in this scenario you have an investment property or your primary residence and then when you decided to sell it you hold the mortgage\nIt's perfectly legal and it happens all the time\nThe way it works is you set the term you set the rate and you make it a condition of sale that you hold the note so if someone buys your property instead of getting all the money\nAll at once which by the way is taxable income you just get the down payment and then every month you get a check for the mortgage\nIt can be a very lucrative way to structure your finances and you don't have to worry about finding a tenant you don't have to worry about condo fees are age away fees and you don't have to worry about vacancies utilities are taxes\nBecause you've sold the place but you still get the mortgage payments since you are the bank\nSo again there are plenty of ways real estate can help you have a comfortable retirement\nTalk to your real tore about any strategies you might be interested in making helped start the process and again talk to your financial planner about which ones might be the best fit for you\nBecause real estate is a big part of many people's retirement portfolios and it might be able to help you achieve your goal of retiring wealthy

your nest egg in your senior years retiring wealthy is coming\nRight out right after we check in with Bill Thompson in the real estate today newsroom Hi Gail Hi Stephen if\nThis is what you still

survey millennials are actually more interested in buying a home than they are and getting married having kids in fact the banks research found that there was only one priority higher than homeownership for millennials and that was being able to retire\nSteven back to you thanks bill [noise]\nContinuing now with our special show retiring wealthy all about you\nYour real estate and your retirement\nWe're going to continue our conversation\nWith a real Torre who holds the seniors real estate specialist designation from an AR who tells us that one of your best real estate investments for retirement\nMight be the house you already live in joining us once again now is Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with macaroni associates in Alexandria, Virginia\nPeter also serves as an advisory council member to at home in Alexandria a senior village in Virginia and he was just awarded the national outstanding service award by the seniors real estate specialists counsel at the national association of real tours\nFor all of his community work on behalf of seniors Peter thanks for coming back\nI appreciate the opportunity we are so glad you're here So Peter in our first hour you touched upon the four ways that investing in real estate can help you financially and you're in later years can you expand on that now\nSure first one is appreciation so when you buy an asset barring some major change HBCUs appreciation should continue to increase the property so once you've purchased a fixture cost but now it's going up in value\nAnd so that appreciation is giving you a greater equity and the property and greater household wealth every year values increase in your area\nAbsolutely yeah let's say for some reason they staged flat you still have increasing equity because you're basically taking your rent and making your mortgage payment so your candidate is paying off your mortgage and dust increasing your equity\nThat is wonderful you don't have to pay yourself someone else is paying for you if you rented out\nYes the three is cash flow it's difficult to make a lot of money on a monthly basis on rent first purchase it but over time as rents go up\nYou start to have a positive cash flow so while your property is appreciation just by the mere fact devoting also\nGetting an increase in rent so that the rental income exceeds your outflow of mortgage taxes all those kind of so you'd have a positive cash flow\nAnd how 'bout number for Peter\nDepreciation the IRS allows you to deep ...\nRental property as if it were a business which it is and the property essentially wears out but real estate wears out theoretically and at a certain patients twenty seven and a half years so you get too deep ... building which is basically a paper last that offsets your\nPositive cash flow and sell very often you can structure it that your cash flow is tax neutral because it's being offset by depreciation\nThat is fascinating So Peter do you have any clients who are now elderly who started investing years and years ago\nI Do and what they're doing is if they've run out of that depreciation\nWhich is basically twenty seven and a half years all of a sudden they start having higher tax bill because they don't have anything to help them offset their cash flow that said they've got rent coming in and it's great rent come yet but it's all taxable unless you have some ... ... which is a paper last to help offset it so what\nSome folks are doing is saying okay I've run out of depreciation I'm going to start that over by selling my property the tax deferred exchange and purchasing that another one I rest let you do that without paying capital gains tax\nYou different until the end of the line when you no longer investing\nCorrect so many investors will continue to kind of roll over their games and acquired new depreciation to help offset their rental income\nThat's so interesting I tell you one more thing yes please so a lot of folks\nAre not aware of the current\nCapital gains tax exemption on their principal resident\nSo there are a lot of folks that they've lived in their home for a long time who's equity has\nGone to the point where it's you know ... well over a quarter million dollars worth of equity that they have in the house because things have appreciate it when it's a principal residents and subject to certain rules they can sell that house and put that quarter of a million dollars in their pocket free of tax\nAnd if they're married at five hundred\nExactly [noise] so what I'm saying ... some people doing as well is\nTaking that exclusion by another property and start that excludes all over again start clock up again to try to get you to slash five hundred and that's particularly useful for people who are thinking a gallon size\nSo why can't sell the ... in fifty five hundred thousand start the clock over again in the tunnels\nIn kenner Fifteen Years cell that walking ... free forever but condo\nThat is such a great strategy Peter\nSo for example I'm In my early sixties and I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in that equity I no longer on\nA

homeowners are now faced with no place to live well they begin the process of rebuilding their homes their communities and their lives but there is a way you can help and that is the real tours relief foundation\nThe realtors relief foundation is a charitable organization with a very specific mission and its summed up in their slogan we bring help home\nIt began in the aftermath of the nine eleven attacks at that time the realtors really foundation helped families pay their mortgages their rent and other housing related expenses to help them avoid losing their homes as a result of the attacks\nSince then the foundation has raised more than thirty million dollars were just helped countless victims of some of the biggest natural disasters in America\nRebuild and start over again\nWe're talking about Midwest tornadoes Louisiana flooding hurricanes Katrina Harvey Irma and now Florence and Michael\nThe goal is to provide help to people who have endured devastating loss from money to help them rebuild to money to help them pay for temporary living accommodations even to help pay their mortgage on a house that's no longer standing the real towards really foundation is there\nThe funder administered by the local realtor associations in the areas which have been hit which makes sense because no one knows where they need exists better than someone who lives right there in that very community\nNow one thing you should know about the realtors relief foundation is that every dollar donated goes to help\nThere's no overhead deducted there are no fees deducted and there are no administrative costs coming out of the money people donate instead one hundred percent of the money goes to help the people who need it\nAnd frankly it's a good fit because as we said quite often here on real estate today real tours help build communities and after an immense natural disaster in which people lose their homes their businesses and in many cases the ability to make an income\nThe real towards really foundation is there to help rebuild communities it's just one way the realtors across America give back in times of need\nAnd just to be clear about it you do not have to be a real chore to contribute and you do not have to be a real chore to receive help anyone can donate and the assistance is available for everyone in a community that's been hit hard by a natural disaster\nSo that's the real towards relief foundation if you're interested in donating just search online for real tourists relief foundation\nWhen you do you'll find the link to the donations page

accidental but CNN this morning is reporting that push up she died in a chokehold\nThat's number one we want him to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that uh you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that an philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nYou retire we specialized work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode and while growing is important\nKeeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a beer market or something like that or you make a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly\nThen what could happen is that you will not achieve the two goals that we have right one is peace of mind financially\nThere's lots of your money you're you're you're done financially uh have peace of mind and then secondly to your money last as long as you do\nTo be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that had doors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you stand for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six of core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd uh every time I talked to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a you know a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay\nSo that's the first thing always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if for example just if you lied on your resume to get a job\nAnd you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise]\nNow

listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with a thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of the family of grandparents do you have children and grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean it and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that I just didn't grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the old thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we created will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now\nAnd if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taken care of and so will there down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think families so to apply this to you personally families that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients are obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble if we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do\nBut in the broader context and how you would apply to in your life you know uh my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song that you know ... I I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay\nSo now you got to keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters\nWe want anybody that comes to ah talk to us that does not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have that person understand that every single time\nDon't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way you take your children for granted your children to go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so you don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe it is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client money matters if you are not and what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net is our website money matters dot net\nAnd you have three things that you can do there or I Want one is you can get my market alert email and it's free goes out at least weekly and or

they will help you to build your financial plan and uh we'll do all that at no charge obligation and if it helps you fantastic and if it doesn't you know what that's fine too we will part French\nAnd then finally you if you don't want to do any of those things that you can also do a third thing which is you can go to one of our seminars\nAnd over the years we've had thousands of people attend our

is money matters with Ken rape and of course I Am your host Kenmore rape\n[noise] thank you\nJack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are\nThe same ideas we talk about with our love it and most valued clients were not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nHours without our ... and most of your clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that are you know I've been the theme of our show this week is\nThat I Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on\nFamilies that are you're doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is is something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisory firm die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created what we called Bijan one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be a strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are bad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do\nTherefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them so that is a culture that is the values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or the or or the or the Marines\nI Know I\n\nWould always say you\nKnow my thought man\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week\nNow this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the theme of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters and as I mentioned a little bit ago we ... we're not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly\nIt's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have the national security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our from what we called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of a ties in with this segment of the show which is an estate planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is a core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\nIt's not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you'd give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life because\nThen your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love\nThen somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe to more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will continue to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a from as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all to love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so estate planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in and cannot come out no in fact just the opposite a Q tip trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit\nOr if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of a Q tip trust okay so\nThink about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you diapers and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to think about so this shall we talk a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way you have success you'll find happiness I think they're just core values that apply in all walks of life\n\nWell Dorothy it is do wonderful to be true because I Want to do some business with you right now that his agenda we're going to bring it back into the capitalist world and that is that if you'd like to learn more about ... advisory farm if you'd like to

I guess that's a per se but that's a positive that's a that's a positive that's not like a negative or I'm going to have seven years of bad luck\nSo like if you don't think I see I don't pick up that tiny and I missed it like it sometimes you don't you're walking really fast on the side like you see when you go with that was that they should have had to pick it up to a site like turning on our ex can happen in my pocket [laughter]\nI'm so lucky eight hundred to two to six to eight hundred to two to five to to to um uh you know the uh this is a great time to\nUh even though you know fall is is a funny it's a relative term right ah in Los Angeles it's been pretty warm uh San Francisco it's cooling off a little bit um and ah prepping that lawns dispatching your lawn this time of year after it's been through a whole season can really be a good idea\nTo promote healthy growth throughout the year this is something that you can do um with a rake depending on the side of the size of your\nUm of your lawn you can just do it by hand it's a great workout\nOr you could rent a one rake if you have a larger piece of property that is going to help get rid of all that ... that can show the lawn and pulled out all up now your lawn will not look terrific\nWhen you first get done doing this he won't be happy about how it looks so um if you ah if you see that don't worry about it it's a great time to add a little seed\nSome fertilizer as well make sure you don't use any fertilizer that has a weed killer in it 'cause it'll let you kill the seat as well\nIt's a great opportunity to just do something with um an organic which I really like it was a couple of different products that you can use on your soil that do a really nice job one of my favorites is a product called ...\nYou may have heard me talk about ... is this great all natural fertilizer full of iron\nAnd it will green up your lawn like crazy it really is something else and you can't really put too much of it on I mean don't like port on but if you use a spread or whatever it might be you don't have to worry about burning the soil or anything it just does such a nice job\nAnd this is a great time of year to go ahead and apply that it it really will make a huge difference so if you're looking to kind of keep your lawn looking great or how prepared a little bit for\nThe uh the the cooler temperatures than now is a great time to go ahead and do all of that eight hundred to two two fifty two twenty two ... radio we're here alive in local every Saturday morning so if you have any questions about\nBuilding or renovating a home maybe you're thinking about a new roof\nYou're thinking about choosing the right kind of windows for your home\nMaybe you've got a problem with the landscape in the driveway or as an issue with bugs in your home\nThat's what we do here on how sports radio I've spent a a long time building renovating homes I I I Know I've mentioned this but it's always worth reminding everybody that I've made tons of mistakes in my goal is for you not to make the same ones all you have to do is give us a call and I'm happy to help you out I don't really see if we can answer another email this morning before we go and take a break\nI shared this is from June and looking at him and there is a vinyl sensing between now my property in many ways the openings between a slap plan my neighbors are near blows the debris always lands on my walkway is there anything to help close up the slack\nOn her side yeah without making her\nWithout making like chicken wire or to look I mean chicken wire is not going to help 'em and the thing is is that whatever you put their your neighbor isn't going to probably like\nWhich doesn't sound like she's too concerned with so here's what you could do 'em with those slaps does she say how tall defenses know she does not you know so here's what could work it's not going to be long term well I shouldn't say long term but if she went to the hardware store she could have Plexiglas\nFinn Plexiglas cut a little bit wider than the openings in the flats\nAnd then on her side of the fence she could using a little silicone talking put a couple of beads top middle bottom and stick them in the gap\nHer neighbor probably wouldn't even know what's there because it's going to be clear\nAnd so this last will still be there and nothing's going to blow over to the site now the problem is depending on how much sun that fence gets\nA Plexiglas tends to yellow overtime you probably get\nA year again it all depends on how much sun maybe it's a shaded area could be the north if it's the north side it probably go forever\nAnd or if it's not you'll you'll have to change them out so maybe what you do is when you go to the hardware store and having cut it and you look at how many slots you need or strips you need and say give me six more and then you have them when things start to yell you swap mount\nNew silicone talking deeply deeply and you're done and it looks good and your neighbor who sounds like she doesn't really like\nWill not care about little bushes for what about just asking the landscaper to not blow the stuff on your you know I mean I we're we're we live\nWe have we don't have a shared driveway but our neighbor's driveway and our driveway are side by side\nAnd so when his landscape service comes you know they blow a lot of stuff but he just jumps on our driveway and does it just sort of you know we're being respectful neighbors type of thing and so then uh when I'm doing any kind of\nUsing the leaf blower I Do the same\nThing I'm like go over there and you know just being a good neighbor being a good neighbor is a good thing it it's it's good for everybody [noise] All right I'm ... and you're listening to

I. N. T. C. R. E. T. E.\nThat's on right pinch Crete and I believe the website is ten to ... dot com\nOkay and they sell small containers you may be able to find it and you you probably won't find that you probably have to order from their website can they make small containers that you did the smallest one I think it's three pounds they ship it everywhere on the porch that you have what is the age\nIn Nineteen forty\nPerfect they make a new concrete color and an old concrete color because older concrete tends to have a little tinge of brown and that as an ages and this is what I Want you to do\nWith where the crack is once you get this a powder mixture going to mix it with water and has acrylic and everything in it you're going to mix it up and uh you don't need all of it you're probably gonna use not even half\nAnd you're going to mix it all up to like a thick\nA pancake batter\nTake some masking tape on either side of this crack\nAnd put the masking tape right on the edge of that crack just exposing the crack and make sure that the masking tape you you do a couple of uh runs with it so you end up with like a couple of inches of masking tape on both sides and then over with that part that's missing masking tape around that\nAnd take a ... knife\nAnd put it in there almost like have you ever have you ever crowded tile before All right so you're going to kind of do that when you get over to the patch part once it's all nice and clean and you're going to put the patch in there and smooth it out with the top of the party knife and it is going to\nBlend and it is going to hold and it is going to uh fill\nIt's not going to be invisible but it'll be a lot better than what you have\nAnd then once you have it all put on their remove the masking tape and use a\nLike a ... over with a crack is using an island and brush because there's probably a little bit of a grainy right to the ... is the ... is kinda smoother doesn't have a little green it's moot okay so then just almost take your hand and kind of finish it all off over the top of it with your hand and then wash your hands when it dries up you're good to go\nAnd you'll have a little bit extra leftover for other patching down the line\nThat's\nNot always I can do I can make it harder if you'd like but that's it\n[laughter]\nI if you want try doing it standing on one foot and see if that you know if you really want to challenge [laughter]\nAll right good [laughter] I appreciate so much for the insulation you got it and I appreciate\nI appreciate you listening to how much radio that's very nice eight hundred to two two fifty two twenty two is our phone number we have just a while we're almost out of time what to do a it's one more email before we go\nOh yes uh this is from colliding Oakland whenever we run out of 'em now whenever we run our gas water here to get hot water we hear estranged low frequency sounds I mean I guess that's what he meant and I'm from somewhere about the ceiling for five to ten minutes like\n[noise] it could be it's probably expansion or you have it could be that it's Halloween right but it could\nBe expansion and depending on if the lines run through the attic space going across I bet it's some kind of as a ... get hotter up in there and get that uh that sound in that rush\nOne of the things that you may be able to do is install an expansion tanker small expansion tank on the water heater it's not always ... it's not necessarily typically to do this on most water heaters but\nDepending on how things are pike you can get some of this sound that prior to doing that what I Would recommend is draining the tank\nDraining those pipes shut off the main water open up the ... they get on the bottom of the water heater put a hose on it and drained it all out open those valves to clean it all out and then fill a back up again and see if that makes a difference if not\nThen doing an expansion tank on the water heater can make a huge difference\nRather time offered this episode of house ... radio but I promise you we'll be back next Saturday drew today to send us an email at how smart radio dot com great weekend everybody [noise]\nThis show British by how smart

Seventy\nThirty four forty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven let's go right to the phones ... ...\nA PHD this is help line live let's go to one in Miami and he's got a question about magnesium is linked to blood pressure go ahead and one\nCommercial thank you I was going you because I had to go um I was string for an Iron Man I I like to do indoor sports and while extreme I developed my check\nAnd make a long story short I could go to the hospital and to get a bucket calf\nAnd then after many cats are discovered that I had the crash I got kind of what's in there I can I just want a strap and our strength y and Z list sport\nI had I didn't read anything about ... you might get annoying about it\nAnd I I can take medication like luck I can make it a catchy medication the question that a habit how do I know um if it would be so why is it out of high blood pressure like I got kind of like I still have it today what because I was singing like Lewis and when I look at my cash no way to show when like me she let her\nKnow or it won't and the reason is that um blood tests for magnesium are pretty much useless because I'm magnesium is held in the blood by adrenaline\nAnd in my opinion it's unlikely that the magnesium was the problem or it's more likely that you sweat very heavily you depleted salt\nYou ate food that may have had bugs in it and it got carte blanche to the circulatory tree\nThat's the most common phenomena that links us to a issues with blood pressure's so could it be magnesium yeah but it'd be real hard to tell you could go in a good drugstore now stick your arm in there and see what your blood pressure is no cause no obligation\nTo get an idea of where you are now what I see over and over again with athletes like you is you sweat very heavily and you're not paying attention to salt now most Americans in my opinion eat too much salt\nBut athletes especially in Durham sadly to anybody doing anything and Durant often deplete salt so the way you can test this one is when you break a sweat you'll reach over to the upper outer part of your arm\nAnd taste the perspiration it should too you taste slightly salty\nNot anybody else you if it doesn't need to take a teaspoon of salt\nLike air dried sea salt or better yet a pink so for two or three days until you break the sweat and you can taste it then I Would cut back and I monitor that so I always have a slightly salty taste\nNow you have plenty of hydrogen ... and no little bug can get past your stomach okay now if you're still\nWant to support healthy blood pressure and when you go and check your blood pressure you may want to go on something like cardio PG how old are you know how much the way\nI Am forty five and I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds\nYeah okay sure you'd want probably about ... four teaspoons of cardio PG and you would use that for about four months\nAnd that's designed to promote the best health for this circulatory tree and then if you maintain your sold but you're getting old enough that salt might not even do the job that you\nYou really probably should begin taking a couple of quantum died just at the start of Maine cooked meals and then at the end of the meal or maybe three to four ... now you have the the just the ... times you had a twenty\nAnd nothing gets passed those guys so uh I think you may be fooled by what's going on here okay a magnesium is famous for heart rhythm and for any issue with heart rhythm are but I'm not so much for the blood pressure itself\nOK okay thank you very much you\nCan buy them All right let's go right back to the phones\nLet's go to Kristen in California and they're trying to conceive the last nine months and the fertility ... says her husband has a very ... right are you there Kristen\nHow old is your husband away\nAnd so what does the doctor recommend for this\n[noise] having our laws are falling to see [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's amusing to me they didn't let you know all the options\n[laughter] how did\nThis is because sometimes is selling one option and not another um but you know you read proverbs it says through the council of many wise men was plans of made so you don't just listen to one guy\nIncluding including me okay [laughter]\nHowever I have no financial axe to grind okay which is quite different so I agree that there could be a circulatory issue\nI don't agree that the circulatory issues solution is necessarily that surgery it may be that he played sports and he's had his incurred an interference field an injury to his low back or to the Iranian or\nTo the tail bones that is the dating the normal energy flows through that area and the first thing that should be done is to look for that because what will happen if you do the surgery is you will now for sure\nHave at least one major interference field if not to the second one being from his childhood or adolescence from some kind of injury\nSo uh if you're in Modesto would I Would do is call the ... get the number of a cure rate person be sure they know how to do much backs called eyes the letter ice packs\nAnd if they do then have them check your husband and see if there's an interference field if there is let's mud pack the darn thing let's get him on something called delta boost to promote\nThe best circulation maybe two per day and also get him on a obviously Cirque du gold to see if we can promote the circulation without a knife\nAnd a simple retail ... of the sperm will tell if this is work you need about six weeks time I suspect you're young and have plenty of time and you really don't want him chopped up if he doesn't need to be\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm not sure that's necessary I've dealt with a number of these and in I'm I've been doing this over forty years and I couldn't tell you that I've dealt with maybe a hundred disease and I cannot recall one that was not an interference field\nSo almost for sure he played a sport he took a whack he fell in his bike he did some dumb thing and it's Twenty years later or whatever and the interference field has had enough time to make a real mouse\nOkay\nHe's also right that could be born with it however if he was born with it it would be unlikely that he would have hardly anything in the way of sperm till it and he is a two percent so he could be right about that I don't want to diminish that that is\nProstate urine or attract but also of course we wanted to touch on the lungs and the lungs are our giant mucus membranes then of course\nThe actually in Chinese medicine the backup to your large intestine and so when we're not digesting well\nWe can expect jump to be dumped into the lungs and\nAll manner of problems can arise with loans and in almost every case what we have to start with is to improve digestion when we promote the best health digestion\nWe can greatly reduce the load on the lungs when we get vitamin D levels to the ideal maybe sixty to a hundred ... a leader in the blood\nJust about no one who's wearing clothing has a really ideal vitamin D three level and it's been shown to be involved in literally all of the immune compounds the body makes it's been shown to be very critical to the intestinal lining\nThe integrity of the lining to the health of the lungs and so much more so than jumping on R D three gold and maybe using six to ten drops a day if you're under forty\nUsually can absorb this really well if you're over forty than it might be a good idea to put those six to ten drops into a half ounces of water and they had two or three or four drops of Lima name that's an essential oil of orange mixed it really good\nAnd now it takes the D. three to tiny tiny little dots and it makes it really it ... it makes it really easy for you to absorb it and get its maximum help for the intestines and for the lungs\nThan another wonderful thing that can be done is dragging plans LAX\nBecause of the extraordinary ability for the this clay to bind to a wide variety of toxins and the GI track\nAnd it can trap these toxins in about keep them they're getting from hitting the bloodstream and hitting the lungs\nAnd then they can be excrete it and not ribs or by the body said today we'll have our de three gold on special you'll buy one get the second one fifty percent off also have our dragon clans LAX give us a store or the line eight hundred three Seventy\nThirty four forty seven to eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven All right this is\nDr Bob Marshall pitch Davis has health line live or answering your nutrition and health related calls he reaches toll free triple eight\nFive eight eight Seventy five Seventy six it's go right back to the phones let's go to Richard in Boulder, Colorado and he's bloating and wants to track down the source of his intestinal gas are you there Richard\nYes I Am doc thanks for taking my call\nIraq I'm how old man or even how much do you weigh\nForty three about one Seventy eight\nThe odds are that the intestinal gas now is from either the gall bladder or your stomach is not able to produce enough hydro Flora gas it and those are the two culprits normally with intestinal gas does the gas you have to have an older\nYes boy does it ever okay well that is going to tell you the fats and proteins are being or writing and so we now highly suspect they see oh\nSo do you have bloating almost immediately after you eat\nIt actually the thing I notice if I'm getting liquids for example um I'll do raw milk here I don't really seem to have anything like that\nOr else okay or stop there say raw food does not require any digestive enzymes so that I Know no need for each sale or anything so you got to exclude those we got to deal with the cooked food okay yeah\nSo yeah so that would have happened had I been taking ac out it maybe two or three in an active later mhm I'm immediately after eating and then if I remember I always try to take it ends up I don't use your mother\nThat's probably the problem let me tell you why [laughter] well I'm not here to knock anybody else's product but normally when you buy detain had record it'll contain perhaps in the catalysts that make it work in the stomach we\nKnow that when you mix taps in with high ... gas it the hydrogen or a gas it's slowly destroys the pipes and\nSo we put the taps in in digest so you need to take a couple of our diet just at the start of the meal now you have pets and now the end of the meal you take the pain had record and it works like downtown but\nI can tell you in the whole world I Am not aware of a single enzyme that works half as good as ours and I'm really I I can tell you with search the earth to get these\nIs a Japanese company that makes these they've been making them since Eighteen Ninety eight they have three airplane hangar sized buildings they supplied China they supplies so much of the world\nBut in America we're manufacturing these and we cannot manufactured to the purity of precision that they can at this time\nSo that is why and what I'm going to say to you Richard is you try ours if you don't think it's the best year ever reuse return it will give you a refund but I'm going to tell you once you get it you're hooked [laughter]\nSenate vertical then it's a few of them with like the first one\nOr two died just at the start of a meal even if you forget and take it at the end works almost as good in the end you would take a couple of HDL and you know that it's working because there'll be no ... on your teeth and if you have black on your deep you know you have low Hedrick for a gadget\nOr the other problem we have as we pass forty and that includes you is that we're facing a real gall bladder crises in America everybody has something going on with their ...\nAnd what we have deduced is that much of it is from eating highly heated\nOils in any food cooked over the boiling point first of all the list it's a massive white cell response so it's going to make you tired right away 'cause you won't have any red cells left which is what gives you energy\nBut also the body is chasing these because it sees them as a problem and meal after meal we do these things plus we're getting large amounts of oil is that we can't just well\nSo if I were you I Would take a Ninety day holiday from all of the olive oil salad with oil and it just used vinegar\nCoconut oil anything loaded with oil any food just take a holiday and see what wonderful things happened to your body and get on some gall bladder PG and\nAt your body weight and oh maybe about three to four teaspoons and use this for about four months\nEven if the terrible gas is not from there but I think it is at least in part then this is going to give you the most beautiful hair and scan after three weeks you'll start some coffee and them as two per week and nothing I've seen in my lifetime\nGives more beautiful hair skin male or female\nAnd let me tell you you can stay looking and feeling the way you do now for many many years to come if you can solve the digestion issue and get your body into a state where you can hold your first morning\nYou're in ph in the Green Zone six point four to seven point on\nSo long as you can do that you know you've got great health great physiology okay\nThanks so much for it I really appreciate it take care of\nAll right this is about Marshall PHD this is health line live let's go right back to the phones let's go to Harry in Miami and uh he's concerned about his mom who's having some low back issues are you there Harry\nYeah a a a a call about my mom she had her out for an hour five bar ...\nThey they come brass ... can ... the fad at Colorado shutting down or the egg\nVery an unpleasant yep how old a woman and she and how much does she weigh\nShe they said that she has five thirty I came down\nWith him so the first thing you need to know is that almost for sure she's in voting laws and guaranteed at eighty three eighty six\nShe cannot digest your food without having digestive enzymes support so before she eats a single thing she should be taking one of them died just\nAnd toward the end of the meal about\nTwo or even three detained Hedrick low right\nNow she'll be digesting more like she did in their twenties the next step is to get her minerals better and the way we're going to do that is to get her on something called boom and joins support here you'll probably need to use\nAbout three caps for meals\nAnd you're going to need even more in the way of minerals so I Would make her a smoothie maybe in the afternoon and then the smoothie we could put two or three tablespoons of greens mix", "show_name": "McIntyre
