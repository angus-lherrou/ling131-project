ears are not going to understand or ever use correct one of the first things that I think would be is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now is television commercials\nMy son watches everything on YouTube right he doesn't know what cable television news is all you too but then we hook up the ... and we're going to watch Sunday Night Football and it goes to commercial things like what's going on here so we just kept us can we've asked for this you know it that's a problem\nI mean I mean 'cause you're you're absolutely right because in in you know where he has never really had that the a commercial or if he does see a commercial that only Fifteen seconds yeah and a half minute commercial there is a skipped\nRight once he watches five seconds of it right I'm In fact when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there going how do you fast\nForward and she's my father's when she goes they don't have that here they don't

the commercials for the younger generations it's a given I Know that you cannot understand about my son is she'll say I want to watch a movie and you'll run and get his eye that we have a sixty five inch television in our living I'm not bragging it's huge\nHe doesn't want to watch it he wants it in his lap and his hand on a small little like that it's so interesting to me and\nYou know what though that it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies\nAnd how they're using it versus how you might use\nIt and I want bigger I mean I'm a huge TV and I see those eighty five interests but they have a ... from drew in over the now\nIn generation okay they're they're not really watching YouTube anymore they're done with you too yeah uh how are they getting their

for a Facebook bus to help promote but like some of the motives on her on the photos that she does but what a search and then some of those ... you know lower and everything like that so\nFar to go to the pros and see what you're up there\nWell basically with the Facebook boxes that you're using artificial intelligence or sometimes people\nWrite to manipulate the Facebook news feed which we all know that it can happen right um\nThere there are some concerns if you do do this in that like you mentioned malware is one of them the other one is that as soon as Facebook gets window of it or if somebody reports you is that they're going to move her push her all the way to the bottom of the line\n[noise] over\nAnd then if she's going to have to crawl her way back up if in fact she ever gets to the top again\nKay uh because a lot of times when you start signing up for this is that these likes or what have you it's going to come from one particular part of the world and as a part of a country that maybe you've never heard of in in the eastern bloc right\nOr it could be happening as someplace that or China or someplace that India and then\nThen you just you become persona non grata and then her business is going to go it's it's good to just it's going to be gone\n[noise] so so I wouldn't do it again\nIf you're trying to ... you know I mean if you're trying to grow the business is that I Would look at you know doing a contest okay you know a look at some type of promotion you\nKnow like this photo we've been doing this on our Instagram account you know like this photo or or you know share this photo and tearing us and then in a week we're going to pick a twenty five dollar gift card\nOkay you're up to them and the best and then also\nYou know everything you know in Montana I'm sure farm photo barn weddings are big are they\nYeah there you say that [laughter] 'cause I was ... I was reading something ... pardon me in on ranchers and stuff like that here\nBut because I was reading an article in the wall Street Journal they were talking about how barn photos are just huge it was like wow\nYou are they are never thought of that are that are on you know so so if you know\nAnd that you know her pictures obviously are burned photos even look at buying Google Ads and we did\nWe just set that up or\nYeah that's a good thing you know Facebook as you can buy as well ah\nShe's done that in the past but it doesn't always drive up you know the and get it out there quite like you would expect it to her\nYou know the other thing that she can do is that if you have a mailing list you're you've you know where you're doing email marketing off of\nIs that you can tie that list into Facebook\nAnd so what that means is that because Facebook has everybody's email addresses that you can say you know here's my list of email address is find them on the site and then show them this ad for a discount coupon and then that would work so don't do the pots just stick with the clever boots marketing and I think you'll be better off thanks\nFor your call come right back now that wireless charges here on the ... commando show [noise]\nOver the years I've tried and tested every way than average people can and should back of the debt on their computers I'll tell you that I drive it simply the best kind of backups there is there is for big reasons why\nFirst it's the easiest to use I back up everything all my computers smartphones I passed tablets everything to one single I drive a ... second it's the most secure was I drive snapshots I'll never lose even a single bite of data never pay a penny because of ransomware\nThird get your data to the cloud fast with I drive express a free shipping service where once a year I drive will send you a physical drive\nYou love your data on it and ship it right back your data will be in the cloud within a week\nAnd forest that's cost effective if you're using any other cloud backup or towards service switch to I drive today get an amazing Ninety percent off their first year use my name came as a promo code that's I drive dot com promote Kim\nHowever is breast cancer awareness month invalid lenient in oil change partners without attempting to raise funds for the national breast cancer foundation dabbling in oil changes donated over eighty six thousand five hundred dollars you can see thousands well give it down to the library says how oil ... dot com\nDocked in his area that really hell bent on my number one he's seven seven eight three in the economy we want to have you done that in ... him off the Beverly Hills Denton dot com\nWe'd get the best soul food in town I mean the best I mean licking you played clean would give me your fingers off its dunes on Crenshaw\nTools on crunch will just south of stock or this is ex quiz at the southern cooking and it's very bad some cooking is the essence of home cooking it's the essence of comfort food\nThey're fried chicken ... dream about tried the ox tails the short ribs macaroni and cheese is for all your catering needs all your dining these ... on ... just south of stocker seven Ninety K.

are you I'm doing well my friend how can I help you have\nA two thousand to a Nissan maximum a drive to fool a freeway the abs like pops on and then and maybe it maybe it's too late us over the speed on that was a working a got a code he won five Seventy four\nAnd a bad sense or something on their ... what like a what'd you say light came on which light came on abs abs I showed a medic in where I call it an automatic braking says yeah but\nUh I when I was ... was my next step I'm not sure which since or\nWhether they got to check it out the ... century says something else happened I didn't catch it you said that like came on and then ...\nSpeed on was not working\nSee I just wonder if that's not a sensor on the transmission to that that causes so you've got to digital speed on it or not it's not cable so you've got a code is a chicken light on\nThe chicken was on but I'm the only one I got one five seven for one five seven for\nWhat we need to check that out I don't have a catalog with me I mean a manual duck and look that up about\nThe automatic speak control divide\nThat's what it may be that's a sensor on the transmission uh-huh but\nThat needs to be checked out by technician should look at that and see if it may be just lose it may be dirty it may have just come disconnected something of this nature I haven't done that chicken July everybody gets scared to something major\nUh-huh so I Would I Would have that checked out by technician\nAll right well thank you sir\nAll right thank you so much for the call I appreciate the call\nAnd uh that's which one oh\nOkay let's go and speak to Andrew Andrew back on line Andrew welcome\nBaggage or are we doing today good we've got about a minute and a half to go here\nAnd that you make that they get that ... it and I got a couple of years well one of the twenty ... the ... when he Fifteen sorry I stand corrected on the political up and he said he was like what a lot of it was a lot of the\nUm I don't have that much I drive about six hundred dollars if it counted mile\nAnd a whole new will be working to get into war and he goes out the ... year old\nWell I don't ... you had to speak up but it it centers on I got a twenty twenty Fifteen right the cool quickly around it\nAnd my question yet 'cause if you use are loaded with ... what is the longevity of sensors on these vehicles\nOr some of them last forever for the history of the vehicle that they all go they all do go bad so\nUh\nOnly when there's a code showing their sometime you gotta check that centers that is what turns the lights on the left of center there and like oh to censor which is the oxygen center that that doesn't necessarily mean the oxygen center's bad but he'll turn to code on which means\nIt's getting a false readings somehow or another and that's why technician needs to check it out and make sure that what's causing the\nProblem [noise]\nSo you got to have somebody look at that and find out exactly what the what's causing that and there's probably something very\nVery simple so I'd have that looked into as soon as possible so and thank you so much so that leaves the law and open a one eight hundred to two KBC

fifty dollars that's ridiculous I Need another job male liberal\nWest LA world but also you surprises\n[laughter] well it's a lot but I I I think if I had to buy one I'd wanna hybrid donate to the point that said that you won't get stranded somewhere I'm concerned but Jay when he called in and says you can go to San Francisco and back but I Am concerned I had a friend of mine has got a Tesla\nAnd ... because he can get into diamond lane and then when he\nHe forgot to plug it in one night he had friends they're coming to house and when he pulled into driveway so some friends in St Joe got talking to them any next morning he got up\nAnd had to drive the Anaheim and lives here in LA he's oh I'm In I'm In trouble I don't think I could say they're called the nearest rental company to get to work right off of this nature so I don't know Jay seemed to be calling\nIf he hears listening he'll probably called him but he's highly on electric vehicles and it seems to be the thing is going in the future they'll probably get a correct it like parking meters going like trust and they'll have a if they'd correct the batteries is just right it's not I think a bread I agree with you

okay Doug given information I called you or you're just so reliable as\nWell Thanks Neal I appreciate it give me a call back any time okay so if they saw All right thank you that leaves the line open at one eight hundred to two to ... a B C and let's go and speak to Randy Randy welcome to the program\nHigh motor man can you hear me clearly loud and clear my friend okay the screener said she was\nGetting an echo [noise] um I have an overweight Ford Fusion and uh I was driving at the other day to work and the it started the spider really badly at the stoplight [noise]\nAnd then eventually that check engine light came on I took it to a shop or early yesterday morning\nAnd unfortunately they had to close it too and they still were not able to diagnose what the problem was and I thought that was kinda strange um do you think that's unusual for a problem of that nature and then I heard it could possibly a friend told me it could be a mass air censor\nWhat mass Airflow censor out there that would cause if this butter and a ... year two years of vehicle two thousand eight six to wait\n... should tell you so you got you we can't gifts ... years ago we can guess about cars you know I can tell you exactly prior to the computers on a computer right I can tell you just about anything that happened to cars happened to me because I've been working on this in this business all my life and so\nBut now with the computers there's so much electronics on these because some of these cars have Seventeen computers in them you know and so\nThe chicken life's going to check engine light doesn't tell you where the problem is most of the time it tells you the area that it may be made to so it takes a technician some time to sort of research that area tells you the area doesn't tell you exactly hey changed this and\nAt one at all the parks doors got in trouble because they'd come and check your ticket code you check in July and you go by part that incorrect it\nRight it it tells you the area you need to have somebody look into it and get to coed gym I have to put together the code but usually the check engine light most of the time will tell you the area that you need to look into and you got to figure out\nThere's like a doctor is no different dog where doctors were doctors of automobile is I mean sometimes you get a pain\nDoctor X rays you and he sees it in a certain area but it doesn't know exactly till he gets in there and try to find out it may be causing from something else you may have a name grown toenail and his cousin your side they're heard something you know back problems are that way I got back problems but your toe hurts and it's really your back causing the problem so\nCarson no different in a Dr Bob I think and follows my show will certainly agree with that that sometimes it's the area that you know especially back problem back problems caused a lot of different pains and things of this nature that does this stomach pains and all of this\nAnd so it takes time that diagnoses areas and cars and getting just like the human bodies almost [noise]\nYeah well they came up with a ... code\nThat shrank lean mixture there so I may have to you may have a back to him they sit\nHours and they still cannot come with is that is that okay is that normal to take ... to trace that it takes that long to trace the problem\nWell it depends on where the problem lies is the hardest thing they're going to trace it down in the days are just boom opening who like I used to be able to do and look at a car ... pull a spark plug wire often tell you oh man that's cylinders not hitting right here is not working\nThe day we had to pull the spark plug world now got hook up my computer to turn off all the lights it's going to turn on because there's going to the computers of sense there's been a problem and I just took the spark plug wire off\nAnd so they don't tell you that no mess fire and and left bank at the end you know if you're going to be a or B six\nIt's all kind of problems so you need to have that checked out it's really a problem with electronics and it's getting worse\nYeah All right well I was just kind of ... not sure because it was taken so I mean they have the car still and I'm sort of without a car for the whole week and then they'll they'll\nWeigh you might want to say you know the shop unless they're working on it and should be able to find out what is causing it\nI Hope so I Hope so it's not so you you don't have any ideas it could be anything you're saying\nIf it's got to lean mixture tells me that has got\n... a yes or no no\nUh the one you've been talking about that they won't tell you the the there's a lot of company bought it\nYeah I'm ...\nBut if you put an addict and there's nothing more than an oil disgusted they big while you just already put the new oil and I would just add\nSomething like that I think it's called tribe attack a nut travel take I don't want you to put the wrong one uh [noise]\nOh my mom's blank anyway one of the oil additives that I don't want to put something as thin and there's got to be one of the oil added\nThat are both to check out God's talked about it for years now my mom's blank on it and I've used it all the time but\nNo I I think I Know which one you're talking about because\nI got a large clear bottle up in a large clear bottle is almost a court ... court yes yeah and it's in a clear bottle and you can see the product inside just not a small bottle is a large I like a whole court and put that in ... president Tom and I think the noise or go away\nOkay now what would you recommend synthetic\nAbsolutely absolutely had runs in the absolute\nThat's a nice engine you want to run the best you can get a very high tech engine\nIn that I can about hyper little hyper Lou that's it high for the guy that hyper loop that's the one okay\nNow what a quick question was that I went to a different dealer and they recommended five thirty\nNow that's only ... that's a brand new cars that for current at a brand new a new car to give them the wrong information for and I'm Glad you\nCalled yeah yeah\nI Do not see some of the new cars have zero thirty\nZeroes like water but I Would go since you got over a hundred thousand miles on a hyper Lou hyper loop right now put that in that didn't go to twenty fifty and I do use hyper loop again on that vehicle and then I bet the noise of go away\nOkay perfect give it a try my friend yes thank you so much and thank you for your service\nOh thank you I appreciate God Bless you my
