would you put your money ground all back and you got to say well listen they played them\nYeah that's the worst game that is the worst defensive game I've ever seen in a post season ever it was like anybody in one inning you made what for errors in one inning ... I mean it was just\nPathetic but I'm\nThe Dodgers are lucky to get out of Milwaukee with the split a once again just in terms of being big money\nAnd look they did what they had to do they got one when a ... on the roads right and they can take care of it is but I just went in their home games so that's the best you can hope to do the same thing as can be said for Houston or playing a

holiday in your home games at it and we're ...\nAnd the military falling down a you know rip on her show for game one but I think the Dodgers defense spoiled bad game not him well he ...\nHe wasn't great but the defense definitely put them behind the eight ball so you know the bottom line is uh they're all good teams and the Dodgers a you know they they ended they've ... they've got the home field advantage you gotta I'm going to repeat it myself or when you're home game yeah\nHit your heads a home run off you it's kind of demeaning led by the way he didn't just hit a home down he crushed that and it it it it's funny because listening to the ... the commentators they even said that they showed the slow mo the guy swing and they're like if you didn't know he was the ... just looked at that guy ... he looked like a ... yeah\nIt was perfect there are pictures that can hit bottom shows are pretty is very good pitcher but I just looked like a lot like the first head of the season while he crushed that ball yeah I was about four hundred and fifty ... ... you know they do the close up of course all faiths and he's just like\nOne of those nine yeah anyway a show or the playoff continue

Rosa say only comes from the southern France Kayla region of Mexico ... a and a Mac turn to morning right here on seven Ninety that's it all the cheap imitations that are out there it's just not certified organic\nWell the state of California Department of food and agriculture is in the process of creating a state license or for cultivate hers or to protect the brand of a California pot to talk about it is our very own weed expert a correspondent Jim real good morning Mr group\nLauren this is very interesting because well California is not the first state to\nA ... to legalize recreational marijuana it could be the first state to do just what you are saying\nThese Appalachians I'm to be able to name\nA particular brand as or region rather as a brand\nTo protect especially the northern California growers soup and you're talking generations of growers who have cultivated their seeds um who have developed certain colors and textures and buzz\nThat comes from these certain weeds and they want to protect them so if you buy we that's labeled as Big Sur holy bud that actually has grown a hundred percent in the Big Sur region of California\nUh and there's a lot of there's a lot of money attached to this\nAbsolutely look a lot of these guys can't compete these smaller a hippie grow if you will up in the northern part of the states they can't compete with these giant warehouses in the San Fernando valley or other places so they really want to not just protect\nOther brand but to just sort of grow their brand worldwide you know this is a this is a world famous area here and they want to make sure that only their name or is the one that can be produced and then distributed to wherever these legal marijuana grows can be\nIn fact there are a lot of the northern California from humble county a lot of that\nMarijuana we understand is very popular in places like Amsterdam they just want to protect that area and then as the money is made in California for recreational marijuana these guys want to be able to to compete\nThe first time I ever heard the ... about Humboldt County all my life was in the seventies in college when somebody said they had humble county wacky weed that's what they call it\nThe thing is that I had no idea what humble county was ... this was in Massachusetts in Nineteen Seventy five or Seventy six\nBut yeah that's exactly the point the point is is that it is a famous brand and now that it's legal you're talking about literally millions if not billions of dollars over time so it's going to be interesting to see how first of all what legislation comes out and how one forcible it as and it's always that's a problem because you can go into a lot of stores\nAnd fine champagne mark champagne that you know from van Nuys ...\nYou know you're you're the laws only as good as enforcement Jim thank you so much follow Mr rope on Twitter at ... news it's five fifty for talk radio seven Ninety KBC\nBen Shapiro here in this world violent crime can make my anyone at any time when it's your time well you'll be able to protect yourself and your loved one in ... Frank ... personal relationship adapter Ignatius ... a front paint fire I'm printing is we have arranged for you and your family and train there to free of charge well ... what a front like that\nOh well good to be here\nIt's a kind of terrifying to think that the twenty twenty campaign is about to start but it is about to start and it it really already has to be gone and that's why we've seen for instance LA mayor and a Eric Garcetti\nMaking multiple trips to Iowa to South Carolina into New Hampshire et cetera and anybody who's interested in anything is already starting to put feelers out for fundraising and sort of testing the waters et cetera but it really does kick in as soon as the polls close in November\nI I think you're exactly right and when you say it started already that's true too people are developing fundraising relationships are either in Los Angeles uh most of the candidates or potential candidates have been through to meet with potential though there's just not just agrees outright uh ... not not for presidential campaign spoke with her tax\nOr for other candidates and that I think you'll see announcements\nVery closely after the election\nI mean you even see a ... to me Nikki Haley's a announced retirement from the un a secretary position ambassador position is really about writing a book\nBeing able to travel the country do some fundraising for Republicans all around the country put some money in the bank for herself and certainly goodwill and the good will tank and she's looking at twenty twenty four who knows what happens with the Mueller investigation\nShould maybe even twenty twenty and their emergency but at the bottom line is people who have presidential ambitions have to look at the whole world and the calendar is a giant chessboard\nThere you're right it's so funny so you know not only do we talk about twenty twenty but also twenty twenty four deaths I knew some as another example of that on the Democratic side\nYeah and so is Eric Garcetti by the way he's got ages insurance favor and if he runs now it doesn't matter what happens he gets name recognition and starts to build a brand nationally and who knows it could end up as a VP pick lightning could strike you never know but the fact that California's primary has been moved up to march\n... and we are in this to me is a fascinating aspect about this because of early voting we could have people in California returning male imbalance in early voting before the Iowa caucuses\nAre\nProbably right about the same time as the Iowa caucuses those we're twenty nine day early voting that I think the calendar day is exactly what the Caucasus are expected to be held so probably registrars would be mailed out the ballot up that day and then ballots would be returned start being returned before New Hampshire I mean what's interesting is that\nIn two thousand what what I think it was\nJohn Edwards swear in two thousand eight when when there was an earlier I think that was the year the California treading earlier primary uh there were a lot of ballots that will return for a candidate who ended up not being in the race\nBut I go yeah that's a California lectured ultimately ... and ... right well\nWell it's also likely we could have people announce afterwards I mean we could literally ended up with people who aren't even on the ballot when we vote\nSo it's possible that and and pollsters disagree I think about how how this will go down but I think the\nGeneral consensus is that there's a core group of people who cast their ballots the minute they get 'em and return of because that's just the kind of go up they are or you may see\nMore voters holding onto their ballots than in the past and on\nThe on the on the flip side really what what could drive this is so much about winning an early primary for a candidate has but momentum going into it next primary right so you win Iowa you look really good in New Hampshire then you look good in South Carolina but I think what's going to be different twenty twenty as the polling has gotten so good in California that\nPollsters will use the voter file\nTo poll voters as they return the ballots and I think that you'll see asterisk next to you know somebody will report ex candidate won New Hampshire but there'll be an asterisk saying more votes were cast California on Wednesday or Thursday or friday or whatever it is for\nThis candidate and so the momentum but I I think California gains moments of advantage there too\nWe're talking with David ... is a national political correspondent for Politico now ah before we get too deep into twenty twenty and triangulating I Would be remiss if they didn't ask you about of course the actual election facing\nA ... in the aftermath of the Kavanaugh a controversy you know obviously the left has been highly energize because of Donald Trump and all events\nUh anyway and the Kavanaugh a confirmation process has poured gas on that fire but it really does seem to me\nAnd this is just you know his unscientific as possible but I'm just observing from reactions on the show or from my own social media thread which cuts across the political spectrum I Would say that that the Trump supporters are as energize now as I've seen him since the November twenty sixteen election\nYeah I think that you're exactly right Democrats thought they would get an edge but new I think that that Republicans would get bumped to the question is who fears butter a\nRepublican you even candidates or knowledge and how significant Kevin ... is especially in me less so in some of these congressional races like you have in California they're so important I mean in the house races in the Senate races though\nIt's a big deal of

school is aimed at toxic wealth is designated a methane site by\nThe department of toxic substance controlled day TSE were just like an active oil field in the rear of the campus for capping unplugging Nineteen oil heads so for them to say they notice they don't they talk about methane gas\nThe only mitigation today have and their latest talking points are to ensure the safety of the tunnels\nBut not not the migratory path that nothing because you can't predict it and additionally they talked about all these safety measures they have for the tunnels those are for the tunnels and those are mandated by law there's nothing good they're doing for us there's nothing beneficial to us\nThey have no business tunneling under our only high school with a hundred year old buildings above shallow tunnels oxygen dated electrified running too heavy field of methane gas and hydrogen sulfide\nAnd to add insult to injury they were supposed to be a thousand feet away at staging throughout the fence line\nThere right they put the most loud noisy machines up a defense sign and about eighty feet away is all of the dirty diesel trucks and and and and equipment going back and forth with dirt and whatnot and there's going to be three hundred diesel truck trips today\nUm and these are not level for trucks that are have no emissions these are dirty trucks at levels we don't even know if their level to we think they're less and they they are two thousand ten standards why would you expose kids to this risk\nWhy would you expose them to to dirty air to\nToo horrible noise vibration why would you expose them to risk of buildings up sinking and subsidence or and or methane gas explosions why would anyone do this and and and they'll cost the taxpayers at least an extra four hundred million that they finally admit to\nWell the usual reason X when I was ... that's the most direct line or to put the purple line and\nAh you know they're ... it's it's basically a calculated risk gets roll the dice because that's where the you know that's the most efficient way to build the subway line a ... and and I assumed that a is a major factor for why the the course was Jo\nNo actually no I Hope the original line was a slated to go down to Santa Monica boulevard the public right of way\nI'm almost all subways go down the public right of way you avoid all kinds of litigation you avoid all kinds of issues with eminent domain and trains like to go straight in the dead of night\nIt was always supposed to be down Santa Monica boulevard an addendum nine two thousand ten they surreptitiously does I decided to route it and do ... do you lose and make a turn on Santa Monica a down last skate than tunnel under our district office building\nAnd down the heart of why why why would they do that\nWell you could ask a former supervisor Mike on top of it basically I'm the mayor was than Antonio Villaraigosa uh doing favors for his largest donors in century city who have a tower and they wanted a trans applause at the base of their building to mitigate um\nTraffic litigation which is very expensive and to boost the density of their building which they were not legal entitled to\nAnd that deal was cut and we got literally the shaft\nAnd I don't think any government agencies should impose a risk on other people's children for dirty backroom deals\nWhere it's warmer Lisa and I have not my ... about it he was there\nAnd we're talking about who's ... who's the Beverly Hills school board president and the issue is the purple and construction going on to the school now it's late in the game for this what are you a ... hoping that can happen here to stop this going for because it's going forward\nWell we're in court right now and the judge uh in September issued an order that he told FTA to turn over uh the documents we've been asking for to complete the administrative record we believe in those documents will be some very significant information that metro didn't want us\nTo see about how they chose the route they chose the route after they chose the route down Santa Monica and they did the ... and then go under the heart of our campus\nAnd we've offered them by the way three alternate routes on the campus to the south under the ball field and we offered them\nTo go back to their original round Santa Monica and they say they can't go down Santa Monica because there's fault but they're inferred we believe they're fake but they're inferred we've offered to trench at our expense they don't want to do and they don't want to know they don't want to know what's going on in Santa Monica because they know there's no active faults there\nIf there were let's trench let's find out and if they're really active fault why did they in title\nTons of large construction project on Santa Monica right adjacent to the fault at was filled shopping town ten thousand Santa Monica tower would just like forty stories high Waldorf Astoria hotel\nAnd and so on so none of this makes any sense we're trying to be reasonable we've offered alternatives we've hired every expert under the sun and they're not interested and the ... honestly putting equipment up against a fund science three hundred diesel truck trips\nIn and and and basically putting not just risk of subsidence and explosions but you're giving cancer to kids\nWell he's a truck particulate are extremely talks\nAnd this has been a problem that has a major headlines many times before Beverly Hills high school anyway because of the petroleum or drilling ... and where you happen to sit you sit on an oilfield so it's been a recurring closing\nDown the oil we were we stopped extracting oil December thirty first two thousand sixteen and their capping unplugging the oil wells in the rear of the campus and I want to tell you it's taking us twice as long and it'll cost more because it's really really really difficult work and it's full of unknowns in full of rest\nAnd we can't predict the migratory path of nothing\nSo is there a tunnel boring we don't know what's going to happen to meth and if it gets trapped in the basement of our buildings and any concentration over five percent is explosive\nWell we've seen those around a lot of money a lot of money hurting a lot of people a reason for this\n... how long are they telling you this project is going to take your\nSeven years at the fence fine and the tunnel boring you know they they say several months under the buildings um I'm sure you know about big Bertha when tunnel boring machine hit casings they stop and the only way to fix it\nAlmost unique ... universal is to go from the top well the top\nFor us as kids and buildings so you know we're in the midst of modernization because our buildings are older and brittle and we're rebuilding them and to frankly to tunnel bore under them and then they get caught on one of the ADA abandon oil wells and casings\nAnd the only way to fix it TBS has to go from the top is pretty frightening for us\nWell do I mean there's just no good reason to do this when you have alternate routes that costs less carry more people a shorter distance we can't understand why\nThey would want to impose this risk on our children and our community and it's not done where in court we just got that great ruling we um are working feverishly to get the attention of President Trump and Secretary Chao we think they know about it um and we still\nHave an eminent domain fight don't forget they still need that he is meant to get under the school\nAnd I hope that any bored sitting there will cite it to the end\nWhen are the most with a shovel in the ground\n[noise] when they get these men and they don't have it yet they haven't even um started the condemnation process uh I think they know it's not going to be easy um the benchmarks for condemnation you know a as very strong favorability towards us\nUm we you know we look Doug we believe in transportation but we also believe in education um the metro or almost like you know zombies all they care about or you know trains and trucks\nBut you can't forsake education and kids and you know they were supposed to go down Santa Monica I made the turn\nWe offered them three alternate routes to the south under the field under the campus we hired all kinds of rail experts tunnel design experts to show them that they can do it\nThey want to hear nothing of it they say that they can't do it because they would tunnel under a home on the south a block three hundred south Lyndon and they say that that house is historic well that house was torn down in Nineteen Ninety eight it looks like a spaceship now\nEverything they tell us isn't true\nThey have no experience tunneling in these conditions why would we believe that\nWell this is ...\nIt's the

providing not just for the folks on the street but for the general community as well and and the result that we're seeing right now is is because of that complete breakdown of of our sanitation standards\nWell we couldn't agree with you more and uh I mean just this morning we replayed an interview we did last week\nUm and ah you know ... this should be a public health emergency there should be we need to be bringing in FEMA\nAnd putting up temporary shelters with sanitation facilities and and we need the legal authority to remove people forcibly if necessary from the streets but we have to have a place for them to go and that's what it it's the two pieces of this puzzle litter missing is one the legal rights\nOr to protect society against the spread of these diseases\nAh and then a

telemarketing calls are still getting paid it's traffic on their service but the problem is\nIs that the the phone calls coming into the house are now so likely to be a robocall that people are not answering the phone and as a result it's people are literally cutting their landlines for a lot of reasons but this is one of the things fueling it\nBut why should I have a landline when the only thing that's going to happen is I'm going to get hassled by a bunch of computers or scam artist so now they're finding your cell phones to now that is right now I'm getting calls in Chinese on my cell phone really yeah a Chinese language a phone calls is West Bank no this is ... well\nMaybe it is but I'm going to hell in a Chinese like that does that come up in a number and chain into the void the pitches in Chinese\nAh oh I see I don't get that in my last name's Wang [laughter] till McIntyre they're confused but the bottom line is that you know we've discussed this for years and this scam\nApparently is based upon finding\nElderly people who are lonely and I and I talked to anybody and they'll talk to anybody and I saw this has happened with my stepmother a down when she was living down in Maryland\nAnd that was my father and my father would never answer the phone that's in good ring until it got a hernia and it wasn't good he was never going to pick it up as it was true when we were kids and the phone was right behind his head at the dinner table Wal phone rang and rang and rang there was no way he was answered it because\nUh ... what was it going to be that was in his interest in what is it like ms September was calling have Bob what do you do and Saturday you know ... father with three kids in a more on edge that why do you want to leave the wife and kids for me there was yeah that was enough\nGood that was ever going to be phoned into our house for a father of three and certainly bill collection I was going to be some pain and they add though he was never going to answer the phone\nBut my stepmother would answer the phone and she would talk to these people\nAll day long and there was one guy who called habitually from Jamaica we found he was calling from the island of Jamaica\nAnd because it when I Would be down there visiting I Would try to get to the phones to try to say what are you doing this is madness I mean you're calling the house fourteen times a day fourteen times a day and this is a living person\nOr you know and then there was the junk mail that would come in because she said five dollars to somebody and then they buy the mailing off that said it's over once you send something and then you got ... changed the phone number that's all you can do\nA but but it's like what kind of an industry is based upon talking to a lonely elderly people because\nEverybody else's hanging up I mean who's or not answer a sudden you you you hear so I'm\nCalling from the home improvement center here and we're in your neighbor meanwhile you can hear all the other ... scam artist and the phone's behind him a voices avoid you know\nWho is saying yes to this they must work because it model wise they wouldn't do it yeah it would not be doing so well we're losing money hiring allies whenever somebody falling for that fake FBI iris scan\nOr the police charity that's calling them whereas all we have a relative that's in prison and I need money to get them out somebody supporting the Nigerian prince yeah it's gotta be workout otherwise and we'd go away we're in the middle of a thirty minute nonstop news ... by the way

was appointing a managing partner of ... three partners as its chief restructuring officer and as part of the bankruptcy Sears will close one hundred and forty two stores towards the end of the year\nUh the bankruptcy filing comes after more than a decade of elaborate merging Sears and Kmart hoping that the the two together would be able to survive and it hasn't happened and some of this by the way is a is the technology obviously the hyper competition of online sales Amazon et cetera\nThat everyone's dealing with Dr van massive corporate mismanagement on top of the CEOs mission

store it's coming close and they're getting field they're feeling because that real estate is not cheap\nSo it's a there's an ... out in the west rallies that occasionally I drive fast and it's called ... now and I owe a ... or ... and the store's been closed for a couple of years now and they just built a ah\nIt has been opened yet they built a chick fillet and on Horner I Know what are you know what it is yes it was a big building is still sitting there empty it's been what at least three they said that they were ... they\nWere going to put in a um like a low in sort of a clothing you know like where you could buy scribes and stuff like that but that never materialized either and then they said chick fillet well they built that nothing\nAnd they're only using a corner of ... of course the property so that you know and this is this is a revolution is making place where all of the malls and all of the big box stores that were built I've talked about this a thousand times I go into a fries every once in awhile I Need a thing that goes into the thing we need to be one of those ... you know that ... thing\nWith the used to go into radio shack but now they only sell cell phones and little remote control helicopters so I have to go to the big bookstore and I look for the thing that goes into the thing\nBut the first thing you got to find somebody who works there who knows where the thing that goes into the thing is but meanwhile you wander around the store and they don't have enough products to fill a floor space there trying to make stuff I'm not again what's the biggest thing we can put in here uh treadmills for elephants put it in there and put a bunch of those in there just because it fills up space for\nAnd you also like you just mentioned you know trying to find somebody that's in my last experience at Sears this maybe six years ago going to the one in Burbank where it took me twenty minutes to find somebody that could actually take by money for the thing I wanted to buy and then they said oh you're on the wrong floor you have to go by is on the first floor\nYeah well Sears annoying has a couple of brands that first of all the Sears brand itself is so important in America but at one time so was the Pennsylvania Railroad you know I mean they kind of go hand in hand uh they did was all going to live off on the train taking it out\nTo rural America and that old Sears catalog which was the ... in essence the Internet you didn't surf the cat you surf the catalog surf the Sears catalog we didn't use that term\nBut a craftsman tools a Kenmore Appliances is there a home in America that doesn't have something with Ken were written on it somewhere in our house it's the uh\nUh besides the a refrigerator that's in the garage it's also the vent the or the fan that's over the stove I Am a fan more and it's oh it's gotta be a kid more because it's the only one that fits this that particular space if they ever stop making those things were\nGoing through the way they've actually been able to stay afloat for the last year or so is by starting to sell off parts of those brands Mm a valuable man and ten more value power very much I don't know about\nThe auto centers there are a lot of those around ... you always get your snow tires change there in Virginia and go do you ... you know tired stop well and people go up to big bear in mind exactly you know it's funny when I was growing up as a kid Sears is always the place he'd go for tools dad would always go and get his tools aircraft or you get\nBig appliances are ... you know you get your fridge is and you're a dishwasher there you're washing machines there and you you know things like steel toed boots or anything\nI mean you can get anything at Sears but that's what I remember going there shopping for guns car housing a literally back and why you want to buy a house they had prefab houses they put it in big boxes and ship it to you on a railroad\nYou'd have to pick it up on a railroad siding and then put your house together kind of like I Can't before\nI go well that that if you've been to that when we were at the Nixon Library Nixon's her house was a prefab house it was that was just weird do five Richard Nixon's father or they're not sure which catalogue it came from because a lot of the Montgomery Ward a lot of those big catalogs you could buy a house\nIt through the mail and they send it to you so they're not quite sure where it came from but it was a ... house to Nixon's father assembled himself and there's a lot of them around the country still standing\nFrom all those years ago anyway we'll see whether or not the Sears brand itself a bankruptcy does not necessarily mean total an a liquidation I mean you know look what's going on with Toys R us where someone's trying to make a kayak so impossible the brand will survive but we know the craftsman and Kenmore will survive in some form\nBecause they're still viable and the products are valuable and people want them\nAll right ladies and gentlemen let's we didn't get to do this earlier a but it seems to me that this is this is one of these uh life it beyond annoyances I learned the hard way to keep my big mouth shut and I'm never saying a word about this again for a variety of reasons\nBut when you see people parking and the ... in the handicap slots\nAnd you see them get out of

many mouse and mice and rats are ah but\n... you know here's the thing about those handy cap placards it's like you know\nShould be reserved for people actually have mobility issues because I see a lot of people who have them\nAnd they park right by the door and then you see them get out of the sprinting I didn't hear that already has nothing wrong with them yeah but what if they have like a

P. orange draw J. P. how are you\nI'm doing great thanks for having me appreciate\nYou coming back and I'm sure the Dodgers were happy to get out of Milwaukee with at least one which is what you really you always love of course when every game but when you get a split on the road you really kind of accomplished your task\nParticularly the way that that first gave would look like the brewers we're just going to put whoever they want it to other ... and whatever anything they wanted to and but out of pictures and every one of the woodwork and if that's if that's going to be the blueprint for the entire series um yeah you definitely want to get one of those first two games on the road\nNow losses a loss but there are losses and then there's game one uh because the Dodgers were out of the game and grunt do I don't know what was going on it's like ... seizure or something it was like Bob euchre was catching for the Dodgers\nAre but the Dodgers came back in a game and they got more than a look at the tying run a third of the ninth inning uh and that's the kind of\nUh getting off the map that really can have a carry over and so overall I think they did okay and Milwaukee\n[noise] yeah I think it really boosted their confidence that they were able to get a little bit of a rally going there against Jeremy Jeffress get a little bit of a rally going against Corey label in the Knight thinning that's two of the brewers better relievers\nIt like you said up six to one quick helpful the brewers manager didn't want to use two of his bed early for that game he thought he had that one in the back\n[noise] um but that's the kind of move that could have a little bit of a trickle down effect\nNow you see it first bringing Jefferson a critical moment in game two he's already throat a little bit the day before and sure enough he goes ahead and gives up three runs and including the home run by charter um so I think that both of those games can have a very practical cumulative effect\nAs well as the emotional effect that you mentioned going in here to game three at home\nNow the cumulative effect specifically is a this you know knew a bull panning term that really Tampa Bay uh carved in stone now the teams who don't have quality starters are gonna look at this as a as an option just simply use the bullpen all the time but the problem when you\nPlay a seven game series is that you're going to see the same guys over and over and over again day after day after day and at some point that can easily flip to an advantage for the fence\nOr as opposed to the defense and that's where I think a fork in a while you know given back that big lead in game one was really a blessing for the Dodgers because they did get into that bull pen in game one and now they saw him in game two and here we go\n[noise] yeah and and the other thing too is that at some point if you are up by their friends as ... did get up by five runs in the first game the brewers manager put in a couple of his weaker relievers thinking that that lead was safe and and the Dodgers were able to get to them so\nYou you worry not only about the ... uh to the doctors will gain by seeing all the different ... arms\nAre you worried about running out of pictures and I think that's why the brewers would have had an added an extra pitcher to their roster prior to the series we'll see if these moves pays that pay off it it's going to be fascinating ah if you're a neutral observer just to see the contrast style throughout this series\nI don't think the Dodgers want to get in there both at particular particularly early Walker be alert to throw a budget and it was today and see if it works\nWe're talking with Jay ... covers the LA Dodgers for Southern California news group of papers", "show_name": "McIntyre In the Morning", "station": "KABC", "day": "15", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
