venture\nAnd this story caught my attention over at crabs security crazy story that I have to tell you about how voice fishing scams are getting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this\n... bags into small Portland credit union last week he got a call themselves from it from an eight hundred number\nThat matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession he didn't answer the first two he's let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this must really be important I should answer [noise]\nSo he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in a hole in Ohio\nMade to his debit ATM card\nShe then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHe would tell the lady listen I'm going to need a replacement card immediately about travel out of state California well the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't\nGoing to be made in Oregon or California or those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California ... not a problem\nAny charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\nWe're going to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably doing a favor\nShe said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up or just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip he says I had\nThat's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect\n... is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother's ... he said yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit code printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seemed ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply the same PIN number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you\nI can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now\nAnd he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account there were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account\nSo what the scammer had was every single thing about him except for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the car and they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had to duplicate the card she had the number she had everything\nIn front of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhat would they get all the information that is our dog when it's on the dark Web crazy

West Virginia population a thousand two thousand people and\nShe had a plumbing business he when he was he was a plumber in the navy on an aircraft carrier and can you imagine the toilets on an aircraft carrier ...\nWill go back to that it will go so that's why you know my dad you know when I was a good heart I feel bad and I couldn't even\nImagine yes and I'm In the in the forties fifties sixties is when my dad was in the in the navy goodness gracious putting my dad\nHad a small business a plumbing business and he worked from before sunrise too after sundown\nOne after another house after house after house she did a electrical work he did carpentry he did the little the plumbing there was no other plumbing businesses there was no other Jerry Reynolds out there and so my dad had\nThis business that within a forty mile radius there was one plumbing company Reynolds plumbing for years he had a monopoly on it\nAnd he had a wonderful reputation\nBecause he didn't charge anybody there was one times where my dad woke up on Thanksgiving Day ... boots on and went to work and we spent all day at this house\nFixing the pipes are I think the types of frozen so we needed to go in and fix these pipes and at the end of the day the woman just said you know I've got not a penny to pay a you know here's a pie for your ears and apple pie for your troubles\nAnd that's the way my dad worked and he had a just a reputation for working as bonds offer everybody in town and when he passed away when I was Fifteen\nHe did not think about a business succession plan putting his business in the hands of somebody else when he died the business died with him he could have sold the business we had assets out the laws do she could have\nSold real estate that we are told I was telling you during the break that in Nineteen Ninety my dad had three real estate properties all rental income generating properties and she did not put a plan in place on what to do with those properties and\nTrue mistakes that were made by my family members and myself for not getting involved I'll take my machinery where I have\nI was Fifteen but you know what I mean you know the army's old you are going to go down there but you were still I regret I regret that would go looking back on that a little bit because we had properties and we had income coming in\nThe over the years the properties went away the business went away immediately and I do the math on that today the rental income we could have generated that was\nTwelve hundred Fifteen hundred dollars a month in Nineteen Ninety dollars right\nI Would have been eight thousand dollars a week a month\nWe could have been generating that's a hundred thousand dollars a year nearly let's give or take a few bucks right\nOn just the property on just the properties and that's with out if we leverage those properties to go buy more properties during good times because these rental properties we're completely paid off one of them was my grandmother's house that was built in the Eighteen hundreds\nOut in the middle of nowhere in West Virginia\nAnd it was generating a income because we had rented it out and this property had been in our family since Nineteen ten and in Nineteen Ninety two that were well I'd probably say Nineteen Ninety five for\nThat property went away out of our family and broke my heart and soda pretty smart to his day whenever I go and buy in fact I'm sure there's probably something I could do you know but I don't get back to West Virginia as much as I Would like to sew\nBut that's that's horrible here there's a lot ... this is not something that sick\nOut of the what it has not out of what drives me nuts is when I Do the math on that we could have generated a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a million dollars a decade my dad's been gone since Nineteen Ninety to Ninety to ... to coming up on them for years twenty twenty two or three million dollars three\nMillion dollars that's not in my mom's pocket not in my pocket not in my sister's locking my brother's ...

C. dot com and Jason on the break we were talking a little bit you were kind of telling me about annuities and different things that you can put your money into and how it really works and how it a certain age you can pull twenty twenty five thousand thirty thousand every single year and then you switch over\nWe were talking about something else you know\nUltimately um in today's Reynolds Wrap\nUp\nAh we want to talk a little bit about protected income or you know we can't we can never know what the economy is going to do and what the market is going to do and so I always tell my clients you want to have a level of assets\nThat isn't the market of course and that is going to be um growing and and and going through the ups and downs of the market but you want to have a level of certainty\nYou want to have a level of income that you know it was going to be there an asset than you know is going to be there and one of those is an annuity an annuity gets a little bit of a bad rap sometimes but there's a menu Newt he's out there there's a variable annuity a fix stability of fixed indexed annuity\nOr they can get a little confusing and that's understandable there's a there's a lot of moving parts to those annuity is but one of my favorite annuities is a fixed indexed annuity\nVenice is real quick for people that don't know what a new lady is can you tell people what that means\nYes so an annuity is a product that is issued to buy a insurance company and it provides you with an income stream\nLater down the line or immediately so what that means is if I for round even numbers let's say I put in a hundred thousand dollars into an annuity and I'm forty two of them let's call me forty F around even\nNumber [laughter] um and I knew that too [laughter] we can all around her backwards for the last eight eighty five is the new sixty five and I say and\nWrite letters legit and so if you do an immediate annuity you can put that money into an immediate annuities and start taking an income immediately meaning if you're forty and you're put in a hundred thousand dollars into the city\nYou can start receiving income for the rest of your life or until about a hundred thousand dollars runs out depending on the company depending on the type of um features that you get because they all have\nDifferent features that you can add on or remove the other one is a an annuity uh that when you put in your money and you let it grow for usually it's a ten year minimum period but if you're forty fifty years old\nTwo years old and you put your money into an annuity and you let that annuity grow\nWhether it'd be in the S. and P. five hundred index or a diversified index of\nStocks and bonds and international equities and bonds you can create your own portfolio inside of the annuity and that annuity will grow over\nThe course of time and when you decide to either retire or need an additional income stream you can turn that on it's called the annuities Asian um and so when you a new ties that you will be able to start receiving income and one of\nMy favorite companies out there is Ali on which is one of the largest global financial institutions out there and they've got several products and\nThose annuities they have a product that it gives you bonuses meaning\nIf you put in a hundred thousand dollars your income value they'll give you a bonus of twenty percent so you're a hundred thousand will be a hundred and twenty thousand an income value\nAnd then they also give you features like protection from the downside of the market as negative they will provide you with protection that\nYour portfolio won't go down either as much or at all you will get credited\nWith zero if the market goes down ten percent it provides you with a protection level which is ultimately what you want out of your annuity you want your money to be protected and when you put it into an investment like the market there's very few protections that you can put into place\nBecause if the market falls thirty forty percent there's really nowhere to hide but if you've got a balanced portfolio of money in the market and the money in I'm a product to like an annuity it will provide you with long term protections and so I highly recommend\nThat if you are fifty years old right now and you're listening to this show and you've got the goal of not working until you're Ninety years old as my mom would say a working until you've got a foot in the grave right\nBut if you love what you do it\nWhich I Do you know I'm not I'm not I'm not big enough toilets right you know what I mean I'm very have no problem working until I'm Ninety or God God willing by it might help the\nStates but I'm also mentally what we want to do as financial planners if I Want to talk directly to\nThose people who are fifty years old sixty years old who want protection and their portfolio we want to have a conversation with you and we want to explain to you what your options are because\nAnnuities unfortunately don't get explained well sometimes and they get maybe oversold so they get a bad rap but when appropriate and when used properly say can be a lifesaver and I and I'll give you an example for our client hum that it will be one of the best investments she ever makes because she will end up getting\nShe'll take money from the insurance company which is the on the on the side you want to be on when she's in her seventies eighties and nineties it's going to be a great investment for\nThat's amazing so people can come to you and talk to you about that kind of investment and you'll explain it because I wasn't sure either I'm like well it ensured highly no I'm going to get money back\nHow do we know that I'm going to be safe putting my money into that but you really can understand that you explain it and you make it okay well I get that now what other what other things can I put my money into how else can I grow my portfolio what can I Do and I love the fact that you were a super detailed there was like you do and we're teachers yeah\nAnd we want our clients to be educated I tell my clients all the time you're going to walk out of my office

know complete electrification almost every car out there is trying to get in on the market of electrification I welcome your calls about that would you buy electric car\nFull electric car note a lot of you've got ... out there\nBut uh anyway a lot of Tesla's sales would you buy another one that's a that's a good back to them\nOn and speak with Brad Brad and pallas Verde good morning\nI'm good morning motor mouth is right although I mean all the time motor mouth I'd come home to say oh you are a motor mouth of the day\nHuh ha ha and she finally got a kick out of that yes she did finally yeah yeah lady\nHey I'm Leon I'm I just bought a Tacoma truck okay\nToyota Tacoma\nAnd you know Toyota Tacoma access cab mhm I'm In a\nDesert of two thousand Seventeen a and I'm looking at my manual to see if this has any kind of a timing chain or timing bell it's an automatic transmission and um I don't know I I I I was thinking is that vehicle have that\nIt may have a time machine on that VA you probably got a V. eight engine and that ...\nYou're going to do I got\nThe two point to point for leader\nTo flee seven I got a four Bangor metaphor bang or in their\n... uh you know to be honest with you I I'm not I would say tell you to know I don't\nKnow it's kind of timing change may have a timing belted it should be on your owner's manual to tell you the maintenance on how to change it abusing nothing in there by the time about it'll have a timing chain\nRight what's the difference so\nWell one's made a rubber atomic belt as a rubber a belt atomic chain is more internal part of the engine in my opinion is much better last longer less problems and but the belt has become very popular in so many different model vehicles\nAnd so it's hard for me to even keep up with it all the cards at one time I knew every model cars out there now and I'd hate to be in the automobile manufacturing business they're all striving to get you as a customer to buy their vehicle I mean look at key I never heard of ... to a few years ago ... never heard of ... and I got a Vietnamese\nCompany that's coming into the arena\nThat try China China's coming in the rain a main Korea I mean it goes on and on and on and they all do the same thing and disaffected oh it's actually made our industry better but now when you come into to the American car industry we talked a world how to build cars\nAnd now everybody most part of our market in the ... everybody brings a car vehicles to the United states\nAnd to sit here and the and\nThen I noticed yeah and I noticed too like you know we talked about the time and change time Inc though I'm like all the fluids for a modern era automobile or these fluids or they necessary should you really get you know maintain these fluids\nThe answer's yes but they have been proved that the fluids show much like motor all motor all is a tremendous improvement over fifty forties fifties you used was usually was just plain oil then they put additives in it\nAnd now the engine cleaner different fuels and that whoever heard years ago\nI had in the Nineteen forty four and it was headed owner's manual had ten pages in it and they changed the all every thousand miles that's how it started years ago then it went to write and direct thousand ... and ... all the manufacturers tried to or not to manufacture shops and thanks tried to get you to change and went to six thousand\nI think I think the buzz word for the automotive industry is that you don't want to you you you want to do less maintenance so you get no synthetic or your your vehicle will run\nFor ten thousand miles it's about keeping it out of the shop I think it's you know there's a there's a philosophy about that you know how long can you keep the car out of the shop because you pay a ... foot you know an enormous amounts of money that's already forty grand\nAnd then they're saying okay you did that you know you made that you made that effort to pay forty grad so you know what what were the reward you and we're going to keep the vehicle\nOn the shop whether manufacturing getting money one way or the other two years ago when you know back in the fifties when I was a fulltime technician cause of always been a fulltime technician\nThe dealerships care less about what we call the back room they called to repair the where the repair and he said he could care less all they cared about was selling new cars they were\nMost of the dealers were independent owned at that time now there's ... vehicles you know one ... one company owns ... hundred and fifty dealers are two hundred car dealers\nAnd so sure it's it's ... it's changed tremendously now they want you back they want you back\nEven though may pay more for their cause those days you pay you know thousand dollars two thousand dollars for a car three thousand but they took it for maintenance the dealers didn't want to be involved the technicians were shortage and know that was a few of us like myself now there are men the shortage where the manufacturers of training them\nAnd that's something I Want to get involved in is trying to teach these young kids that's our future in the maintenance end of where this men or women bigger than ever\n... is a good is it good livelihood believe me I'm I'm a retired longshoremen and I tell you I Love mechanics but like you said if you could get young kids plant that seat in their mind and senior this is a good career path to go down\nAs good as Adam West and thanks for your call I'm running out of time there did fluids I've come better now they don't they don't need to be changes opt into one main thing is the trait fluid is the thing that I'm concerned about the most is is the brake fluids on these vehicles and thanks so much I appreciate your dog your\nLegs and open a one eight hundred to two two KBC boy that our went by fast but we come back we're speaking to ride and Kathy and Tom\nFor went by so fast I guess a motor mouth is the

A. B. C. and let me get your opinion about that or anything else I say you know I've been wrong once before so\nAh let's see Kathy welcome to the program good morning\nOh good morning Leon it's such a pleasure to talk\nTo you know God Bless you thank you\nAnd I'm also a little emotional because my dad and um he loved you and and now he passed away this year but he was eight twenty nine they can\nCome home and God Bless him I Love him to know I I I Know how you feel so trust me on\nThat he liked planes they like cars and it was good at that those things he was very knowledgeable\nOn dams a happy man yes yes that he would want me to be asking a question here um\nI inherited his car and it's got about Ninety seven thousand miles on a on two thousand and eight a three fifty or state easy and it's I'm blowing through rear tires pretty good and um\nI go to a a a um independent Mercedes dealership and a candidate and at one point\nEarly on they had told me they you know get the alignment and it's got a a like a sports package kind of on it right and\nI went over there a couple of times and there was I just got a weird feeling and and so I I didn't follow through and by the time I went back for regular service at the independent they kind of blew me off on on having that done and it was a very involved process improbably inexpensive process but I just\nHad a weird feeling and then to hear them after the fact kind of like say oh you know those cars kind of go through them and\nThat's not true okay because well first of all a Mercedes is independent we'll suspension is not I don't know whether you understand what I'm Talking about each wheel is independent will move independently owned Mercedes\nAnd I don't know what the cards ever been in an accident or thing among minor minor and may have been hit on the rear wheels but in the event most alignment machines now today modern alignment machines are full we'll on line but you need to line up front with the back it's not just aligning the front wheels that we did in the past\nBut uh I think uh I see on the line we got Jay Leno in Milan ... good friend of mine in a while and he probably agree with me hopefully you'll agree with me because she knows a lot about vehicles as well\nAnd uh probably knows more than me so he may try to take my job I think that's what he's trying to do but anyway they need to fool we're because the key is is to get the front wheels aligned with the rear wheels not just the landing the front wheels so\nYou need to take it to a good alignment shopping should not to rear wheel should not actually the front wheel should be wearing out more than the rear wheels\nEven even on a a rear wheel drive vehicle\nYes unless you hot rod her unless you're spending the tires and race I mean somebody like Jay or me you may wear out the rear tires a little better but you want a normally\nAny specific like put it in any alignment or is it better to go to the dealership does that make\nIt any good quality alignment companies should be able to do it somebody who specializes in online much now also the is it one tier their lives are both tires wear out\nYou know I it's both tires\nBut it's just not normal for us just not normal not unless you are hard drive or a new racing around and somebody other than that different times usually where at first 'cause that's when you're turning in going back and forth\nRoughly what what is a rule of thumb you know I Know it's how hard you drive the vehicle that I'm for new tires or that you know mid grade or high grade even um what would you expect how many thousand miles\nThirty to fifty thousand miles or every five years\nYou know and I had a problem recently and I just got for brand new per rallies and um [noise] they get some alignment and they did break for me but then he said I'm coming back in three thousand miles and I can um switch the pac\nDoes that make them well yeah rotating the tires rotating the tires but still the ... as a rule we were out before\nIt's different though that size on the front and back so he's talking about doing\nIt if the different sides you cannot rotate them\nBut he said something about flipping the\nTire you could go from left or right but if their direction or tires I Know I'm confused and yes and a lot of question and that if the directional tires you cannot switch from one side to another okay directional means that going in the same direction all the time so have you switch to the other side they're going backwards\nAnd I don't want to do that no okay I have a good Lyman shop take a look at it in my opinion that is not normal\nOkay and then favorite car after a male oh\nNice nice car Cathy thanks so much for your car thank you Bye bye bye now okay okay okay let's go back\nTo the phones let's go speak to Jay Jay welcome to the program ... and ... rearm afraid of them\nI Know I just I just want to use that you talked about electrification and I'm driving they let
