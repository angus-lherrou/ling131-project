purposes\n[noise] know that you're exactly right and I think that you know we we are used to hearing these stories of fraud in ... for example and [noise]\nYou know we get outraged or eventually the outrage kind of dissipates because it become so common but you're absolutely right I mean people responsible for what they do but we shouldn't be surprised by what is surprising\nIs the fact that that oftentimes the federal government sometimes at the state level is they don't even want to do basic stopgap things to prevent it from happening so in this report up people can just go to our website a\nCronyism dot org and download it but in the report I mean we give examples of people who were charged with and convicted of engaging in ... chief fraud and millions of dollars worth now it's considered a white collar crime so you end up going more to a club fed type of prison of that are hard prison\nBut these individuals having committed the crime go to jail for three years they come out and what are they do they go to another state and they become an ... tea vendor again\nAnd they engage in fraud again and you wonder how does that happen what they actually didn't change their name the problem is is you are not required in the state to do a criminal background check on somebody who can become any ... vendor and so that's the sort of thing that ultimately you're right people are going to do this there's\nThere's money here it's a magnet\nBut we ought to be doing very simple things that say look if you had to gauge the misbehavior in the past if you are a criminal we're not

couple of fact there are three at home and I didn't bring snow shovels with them as they go back to them on the\nI'm Steve the uh uh the ... report coming out now is that several at least several of the bombs that quote unquote bombs that were sent\nA were not capable of exploding and others are still being analyzed\nIt is it possible that none of these were actually a functional bombs at the whole thing was to terrorize obviously the intent is still the same there's no way anybody would know looking at them that they weren't capable of exploding but is it possible that all of them er nurse well\nOf the NYPD Commissioner and the assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office were pressed on this yesterday\nAnd ah neither one of wood elaborate on whether these bombs were rigged to explode or if they were designed just to instill fear\nOr they said that they are handling all these as if they were lived devices until they are examine further but they wouldn't say what those examinations have have told them at this point\nUh and the reason for that if they don't want anybody to become complacent or let down their guard because you've even let's say\nThese are these ten let's say let's say all ten of them were were not a risk to explode that doesn't mean that future packages wouldn't be in and could be explosive so they did say that there was black powder in at least some of these pipe bombs so are they are a potentially dangerous\nOr when pressed on this the police commissioner was asking oh well then what would you call these how would you identify these packages and he fits affected explosive devices\nAre they suspected explosive devices are suspected of coming from Florida or do we have any ah any indication why the police believe that they are they came from Florida\nWell all of us are reports that are out there on this said that at least some of these packages were traced through a U.S postal service a facility in Dade County ... and uh the FBI's official here in New York again wouldn't comment on these reports\nBut it's pretty well established now that uh this is one a focus of the investigation\nOr one of the other things of course you can't have a story like this without conspiracy theories especially today so I'm looking on CNN and says breaking is an eleventh package found in Florida addressed a senator Cory Booker okay so there we go they're still finding them\nAnd we have no idea how many more uh there was a search at to die and find signs office that turned out not to be\nA one of these packages but a conspiracy theories of course of running a wild as they always doing a story like this and one of the things that people are pointing to is because CNN posted a photograph of the package that came to John Brennan care of them\nWas that the package had ... canceled stamps\nOn on people that go on a false flag operation but I'm looking at postal service blogs\nWith a lot of people asking has the U. S. P. S. stopped canceling stamps and a lot of people and this was way before this incident this go back to twenty Seventeen twenty sixteen people saying that when it comes to packages often times the stamps on those packages are not cancelled\nYeah and oftentimes you'll see it and you see it in in in one of the images of one of these other package is not the CNN one\nOf the the postal markings actually wind up on a different part of the package right or they don't always wind up on the stand sometimes it's like on the bottom yeah on on an edge exactly\nAnd one in one of them was actually returned for ... for postage do\nSomething like that it ... the one that was addressed to Eric Holder didn't get to him and it was a return to the address that was put on there uh for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nRight they were using Debbie Wasserman Schultz former ah DNC chairwoman and the congresswoman from Florida they were as like the return address return address right\nSetting a you know you're talking about all the speculation that's out there you know in the police and the FBI are are very clear about this they say that that doesn't help their their their investigation which the primary goal is to find whoever's responsible for this um\n... yeah but you know we were living in an era where the administration has gotten out of its way to discredit the FBI so we [laughter] that's the problem is that we we damn well need an FBI that can investigate these things and have confidence that they're actually doing their jobs\nBut then we have a an or on the water that's trying to muddy that up so that just one of the many things we have to fight through these days All right\nSteve thank you so much appreciated a fall asleep on Twitter at ... cast and bomb at five fifty for talk radio seven ...\n[noise] from what Halloween costume I'm gonna cut I holes and uh she had them around all them along the coast\nAnd now you're not find reasons to visit Iran do this we\nThirty thousand dollars dumping tournament Wednesday October thirty\nOut trick or treating\nYou ... when John Barr have\nOur safety Thursday to get like\nOf one hundred and eighty thousand dollar is Jean Jean PR\nAround all casino resort as well conveniently located on too long ago good times\nCredit products are made by ... written terms very base my credit history Amazon ... promotion other restrictions apply the website for detail\nHow do I get into critic on a trip to the emergency room\nMoving expenses there's a million ways to get into a credit card debt but one sure way to start getting out of ... von ... online on secured loans from two thousand dollars for thirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and no extra charges were being back early over five hundred\nThousand customers have experience for the convenience of alone drove on no wonder about has an a plus rating from the better Business Bureau the application taking minutes for ... for dirty pm central time Monday to friday funds are deposited as soon as the next business day and now we're black would also give you a fifty dollar Amazon dot\nCom gift card after your first thing that is made on time to check your loan options had to get their special radio offered to go to Yvonne dot com today and enter promote forty\nSix forty six when it blind that's Avi A.

C.\nIt's on an extra ten we update of course on the suspicious packages sent by a terrorist\nForce or risk the Saudi Government is now admitting journalist who still it was a premeditated murder and Medicare prices are way more than in other countries you're in the United states and the president says he became\nSo all of that more from your parents or your ...\n\nYou're hooked on this aren't ya somebody oh yeah that was good at work it's been around since Eighteen twenty five do lots of choirs and done\n\nInterpretations are great yeah there was a gentleman Arlen\nTen of Florida mayor David stewards at a bit of trouble because uh Katherine ... the ones who am I trying to get speed bumps put\nOn her street who says I'll give you a bumps if you give me home so yep oh\nBack for more hours\nJay Jay peak of supporting your little have lots of course you're having his drugs drugs are bad\n[noise] you're not shot Rand\nYear [noise]\nLos Angeles or shown to Mueller station\n\nPackages discovered wanted New York city that was a want address the James Clapper the other one addressed to Cory Booker was actually a going through that same facility in Florida that is right now under scrutiny\nWhere at least several of these packages I've gone through this facility and ... just north of Miami so uh this is a again a ... it's been about twenty four hours since the discovery of the last packages yesterday\nSo here we go this is continuing officials are saying that uh they expect there will be still more out there and they should be considered viable explosives potentially destructive devices even though none of them have gone off\nAh and ah the report this morning is is that at least several of them were not capable of exploding alright there's still being analyzed would of course that doesn't ah minimize what the intent was the intent was to cause panic like all terror\nAnd certainly put people on notice\nA this is a shot across the bow out as a bare minimum\nUh it's uh it falls into those categories we're talking with NBC News correspondent builds up here uh the uh New York police department NYPD is put out a a a message on Twitter account we're responding to a reporter spaces package in the vicinity was fifty second street and eighth avenue a police avoid the area expect\nUh the LAPD ah or I ... excuse me I'm ... LAPD cleared a suspicious package near\nThe LA office of Senator Dianne Feinstein yeah but it's interesting that Cory Booker made this list because of course he was a prominent critic of Brett Kavanaugh during the confirmation hearings as well as a prominent critic\nOf a President Trump\nA fitting the build up one question I have about the packages do we have any indication that they're all essentially the same weight\nOr using the same amount of posted in other words are they all the devices that whatever they are are they identical or some of the bigger than others\nWell they are uh just about the same size they are very similar there are some subtle differences between devices some of them are you may have seen these the pictures that had like a parody ISIS\nFlag on them are there are some subtle differences between them but they are basically the same size the same weight a shift in the same size envelopes they all of them are very similar and the way they had been constructed now or at the at Quantico, Virginia\nA terrorist explosive device analytical setter they're tearing these things apart and trying to determine where the materials may have come from and whether this is indeed a case of someone who just was not\nA very knowledgeable about constructing these devices or someone who didn't intend them to go off it's amazing how much they can tell from an examination and there's a lot of evidence there these are guys that can take a fragment from unexploded bombs\nAnd and tells you a lot about that bombing where it came from and who made it so they have the entire devices here that they're working on\nThey're going to get a lot of evidence out of the but they all have been very similar to this far and what we're hearing so far is that these packages this morning we're also of that same\nType now are obviously in the post nine eleven world virtually every major a population center has cameras covering everything but but because these went into the post office\nThen it's not necessarily going to be helpful or to law enforcement to find out who physically brought the packaged to build any specific building the one that will matter is who brought it to the postal center in Florida\nThat's right and in that postal ... are there are some self service kiosks where you can send a package\nSo uh that's a possibility that they could be able to track that with surveillance video and also the tracking system the postal service uses now ever since nine eleven as you said it is pretty intricate so that once they know that this package went through this facility they may be able to backtrack\nIt to find out at the point of origin\nAnd then a start looking in that area as well so there's still a lot of legwork that has to be done here but this case is taking on priority for the FBI international priority this is the number one case on their list right now so all of their available resources are going toward\nFiguring out who is responsible for this series of packages now that we have twelve of them\nUh it's fascinating in all for all the wrong reasons why we asked remember just about a month or so ago there were envelopes with suspicious white powder sent to the White House\nAh to President Trump into a couple of people including I think a General Mattis a and that was obviously a handled by a secret service says well we don't hear much about that and I don't know that anybody has ever been caught for that a crime\nNo doubt that I Know that's a good point and there wasn't much of it of course it was not a biological agent or that they found there uh but still a something that is being investigated I have not heard a result of that investigation but yeah that's a good point\nToday and they hadn't done juniors wife open it isn't in exploded in her face yeah a ... remember that package that was sent to Donald Trump junior and his wife opened it and it it like pet stuff gone all over her and she had to be go to a hospital\nYeah that's really yeah it didn't turn out to be anything too bad but still\nYeah kind of unnerving there so\nYeah there have been several instances in the past and\nAh it but this one a just a little more than a week now before the midterm elections is certainly something that uh is designed to disrupt and perhaps influenced the midterm elections that something investigators are looking at as well and there's a wide range of options there as you look at motive for this particular type of thing\nAll right listen thank you so much bill appreciative embassy news bills and fear of reporting for us uh and\nYou know ... again\nIt it's interesting this\nStory is obviously getting a lot of attention because of how many bombs there are an out an on going and it's out amongst the civilian population\nThere's my guess is that there is not a day goes by that the White House\nDoesn't get some kind of a threats and to have yeah and we don't hear about that if he maybe because Daley's kind of like\nWhen a when a lunatics used to run on the field during baseball games and they used to put it on television in the early seventies if someone one on the field\nOf them then everybody's going to walk out each year and then they finally realized policy now we if by showing it we're encouraging it now they never showed on tell me never see I flopping anymore you don't see that any more including the strikers by yeah in that used to happen well you know you\nBanned it ... exactly remember how we we sort of you know when we're talking about school shootings some people are saying well let's stop talking about the school shootings and not getting twenty four seven coverage on it\nWell now we're doing is talking about all these packages and I even heard somebody talking on the radio the other day we were like well maybe we should stop covering it can be the person is loving all this attention but you\nKnow well here's the thing and this is my point about the way these are being covered when something comes to the White House in every administration going back to George Washington someone's threatening to kill the president happens all the most\nOf them are just you know people mouth off they're all ... looked at their all examine but they do keep it quiet because they don't want to encourage more people to do it but it's easy to keep something like that quiet because it's a sealed system ... it's very difficult to keep a school shooting quieter\nWriter difficulties have won the massive sixty story tall Time Warner centers being back on the street with a you know and it's a TV network in there it's impossible to keep those things quiet and that's why\nUh even though you're probably right if we didn't cover like the major league baseball making a determination the way to minimize doped running on the field after twelve beers is to don't put them on\nTelevision I mean you know the guy sent these packages are people who get it or watching all that coverage looking at all the man that's causing going they haven't found the other three we've sent in the mail wait till they find those you know that it's sickening so ah\nThe search is still on obviously for whoever uh Israel whoever is responsible and it could be as a single individual it could be a group of people who knows\nA if you're committed to doing this uh and you're crazy enough to do this I'd I'd actually it would be in some ways a\nIt would actually be comforting to think that it's only one person I'd hate to think a bunch of people got together and said yeah this is a good idea\nI think it has to be one person because they're all ... don't actually\nWeren't well that might have been a point now that the goal yeah\nIt is and they talked about that they send them to people who they we knew they would never actually get to the person that it was intended for and the ideas monthly they create\nThe higher they still grades of panic and and uh disrupt society and they put they put you know their targets on notice and they put him on notice that um you know\nWe we will we're trying we're you're in our crosshairs and it's getting all the intended covering Tony recovering at wall to wall in there and back you waiting buildings without actually killing people but it's putting everyone I've noticed when you're who were targeting right and the thought is if I get caught at least I haven't committed\nMurder and learn a lot of support for my idea of how to resolve this are we getting right now why do I need the mail at all\nBecause we have to send warrants to your house [laughter]\nIt's too expensive for us you Sonia and so they're leaving but it's cheap for ...

Bush and the Catholic Church on wanted single payer health care et cetera and what we do is\nWhen we find a political meaning of a a lunatic then we lump them in to our political enemies\nOr because it's a way of describing a whatever radiology we don't like\nA ... and this just adds to the ... the a language and the tenor of the times in which we live where are a political opponents aren't just wrong but they're evil\nAnd and I think that we we we make a grave mistake\nIn just trying to isolate lunatics as crazy people because really the times in which they're living is shaping their actions and and were contributing to it by mass marketing\nA hatred towards our political enemies at this moment in time and there are consequences for this because crazy people have set the world on fire when a ... a Gabrielle precept\nA shot Archduke Franz Ferdinand in ... he triggered World War one when that a crazy dutchman set fire to the right to start building in Germany and thirty three gate Hitler the excuse he wanted to roll back civil liberties and send them on a road to World War two so crazy people can\nCan trigger the destruction of societies\nThey can and this individual can impact on the midterms which you have to believe the timing is significant yes there was a reason for that timing to\nTake place how that may happen we don't know yet but you know you and I you you've uh talked about some notable cases it was back in the Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties we remember George ...\nThe so called mad bomber in New York City this guy built thirty three devices over that Eighteen year period put 'em in a a a red stocky in a Red Sox and planted them all over New York city twenty two of them blew up what was the reason he did it\nBecause he didn't get the proper insurance he thought he should have when he left Congress and at the time so for Twenty years almost\n... wages a war\nAgainst Con Edison and against New York city well now an individual like that other guy we're dealing with right now only has to do is sit in front of his TV\nAnd collect from Fox to CNN to MSNBC and what ever farfetched theory idea or whoever he wants to hate he can find a network that will feed that\nAnd unfortunately the more he's fed the hungry or he gets and eventually\nYou're going to have these people just like this person act out against what does this political affiliation we don't know as far as I'm sure the FBI they don't have a dog and the fight other than the truth right now and trying to get to this guy off the street and I think it's terrible that people are claiming he's\nGot to be a left wing he's got to be a right when I don't care what is she is a potential killer let's find him let's lock him up and then we'll talk politics later\nWell unfortunately politics has very much impacted the FBI itself and that's part of the problem is that the president is a political brouhaha with the FBI has compromise\nIs not their function I don't believe it's in compromise their ability to do an investigation but he has a damaged their believability amongst many millions of people\nAnd that's the challenge you know when I was an FBI agent for twenty five years we had a phrase among us or statement it was don't embarrass the bureau it's whatever you do get up every morning and realize\nThat America trusts the FBI and you've got a responsibility for that trust you know you're you're the last leg of that investigative ladder that people want to be able to trust and we've had three or four people who violated that trust in the

you know the Peter stroke or you know tech text message exchange about we won't let that happen [noise] meaning the election of Donald Trump as it was incredibly damaging to the bureau because what I

there weren't fail because he's president but the bottom line is there was something that never should have happened\nA and yet it did so that you know you ... the people who have a badge and a gun and the authority of a law behind them have an awesome responsibility to use it with great restraint and with perfect integrity because man\nOr when you lose that reputation it's so's cynicism in

the\nFox Fox actually gave Megan Kelly in primetime special interviewing Donald Trump and it was like fourth place in the ... yeah\nI Know a so they're probably looking for a reason to part company
