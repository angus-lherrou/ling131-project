twenty shouldn't present in two thousand seven to ...\nDo you think's bill\nContinuing with our very special program set for life all about taking a big jump by investing in real estate when you're just a few years out of college or maybe still\nIn college and right now we're going to talk about saving time and money would you're both precious commodities and especially when you're an investor\nBut this approach involves just getting really simple let's talk about it now with Laura Adams host of the top rated money girl podcasts ... is also the author of several books on personal finance including money girls smart moves to grow rich Flora welcome to real estate today\nThank you so much for having me\nWe're so glad you're here more as you know I follow you on Twitter and recently I saw one of your retweet called seven lower for ways simplifying your life can see time and money I'd love to talk to you about that\nYes this is a post from acorns dot com\nThat highlights some great ways to simplify and I'm all about like ... ... and the first is declaring and this is something that I think we have to battle on an ongoing basis you know I'm sort of all that you build an e statements and getting rid of paper\nSo if you can convert all of your finances to the digital realm and stopped getting papers dot filing paper how will really help the clutter your life and it also\nWill help you save a lot of time you know you can even keep records that you need for taxes keep them digitally so that's the very first thing\nYou know that it's just such great advice Laura because the tools around there\nThey are that you don't have to have piles and shoe boxes full of receipts anymore\nThat is so true I mean going paperless is really easy most accounts in an institution they like that too because it saves them money so go ahead and requests paperless bills and make the switch over I Know it can be intimidating but if you do it's slowly and and just sort of start converting everything over to digital you'll feel great\nAnd I also believe that automation is the key to simplification so if you can automate you're saving maybe you're working out for a home down payment on auto pilot maybe just moving money from your checking account\nOn a regular basis to a savings account having that sort of working in the background of your life you don't have to think about it that's the trick\nI've heard you say that many many times more than if you make it automatic you never see the money you're not tempted by the money and your savings will grow\nThat's so true and you know we have to trick ourselves we have to really sort of set up barriers that prevent us from sabotaging our financial success the automation is one of those ways\nAnd also looking at your debt you know the posts talks about consolidating or refinancing student debt so this may be something that you should take a look at depending on what type of debt you had it can also worked for credit card debt\nJust trying to simplify it you know taking five loans and and consolidating them down to one low rate loan means that you just have one painted so that makes your life a lot easier it also saves you money on interest\nExcellent and then\nRe think your housing situation that's interesting\nYeah you know housing is probably the largest expense that we have from most of us are house or even at the end of the mortgage payment of rent payment is\nReally our biggest one so if we can look at downsizing that is one way to save more money so maybe you have to take a step backwards in order to sort of save up and and get that home that you really want are making a movie that you want and you know it may be that you're looking for\nThat's a different city maybe want to relocate into a a place that is more expensive so if you can downsize now and save up when you make that big news you'll have more money in the bank to do it\nThat is wonderful and Laura the next one if you actually sit down and count up all your memberships and your subscriptions and your services that you pay for every month you might be amazed at how much money is going out every month\nSo true we're all paying for something that we really don't need a we're not using and those gym memberships\nMagazine subscriptions when you're not reading them they're all kinds of things that companies are smart and he said they're moving over to subscription models because they know we tend to forget that we're paying for these services or even what we're not using them so reevaluate what you're paying for cut back on those things that you're not using\nWonderful and the last one on the list plan your meals\nYeah this may sound kind of basic but we really can tend to overpay for not only food that dining out when we just don't have a plan for our meals and so I'm a big believer in thinking about it on a weekly basis making sure that you've got enough to make multiple meals so\nTo save time if you make a lot at once and then maybe put it in the freezer and make lunches ahead of time anything that you can prepare ahead of time is probably going to save your money and definitely going to save time so it just went one way to simplify your life so that you can focus on the big things big wins in your life\nGreat advice Lauren you know following you on Twitter is a great experience because sometimes you are presenting articles that you have written but if you see something interesting that has to do with personal finance you pull that right into so if one of our listeners would like to

[noise]\nReal estate today because you love real estate [noise]\nAgain now with our special show set for life and in depth look at how to get into real estate when you're young and generate income\nAnd build wealth we're going to wrap up today show with a look at one of the best tools available for every real estate investor\nA tool that helps you move from a small real estate investment to a bigger real estate investment and all the way up to an enormous real estate investment wild ... your tax it every time you sell one property and buy another\nIt's called the chain thirty one like kind of exchange it's part of the nation's tax law and it has huge benefits for everyone who invest in real estate\nAnd that's true whether you're buying a single condo or old one thousand unit apartment building so let's take a look at what it is how it works but remember I'm just giving you an overview here so if you really want to use the ten thirty one talked to a real estate attorney an accountant and your real chore\nSo when you buy an investment property it generates wealth in two ways one it creates revenue every month when their incomes in\nInto overtime to property will typically increase in value so good over a matter of years or a matter of decades the property will become much more valuable than it was when you purchased it and you know what that means when you sell it you might come away from the closing table with an enormous check\nNow if you just sell the place and you don't buy anything else sure you will have to pay taxes on your profit but if you take that profit and use it to buy another investment\nAs expensive or more expensive than the one you just sold you can pour the entire profit into the new place and defer the taxes\nThat means that if you make a one hundred thousand dollar profit on your first real estate investment\nYou can put the entire one hundred thousand dollars towards your next ...\nInstead of just what's left over after the taxes it's a huge benefit to real estate investors all across America because it's helped many people go from a single condo to a four unit building to a forty unit building and on and on\nAnd you only pay taxes on it at the end of the line when you've decided just now your real estate investment and not by another property\nNow using the ten thirty one like kind of exchange is not for amateurs this is the big league so you want to work with inexperienced real estate attorney and accountant as well as a real chore who knows investment properties inside and out\nYou can't just do it on your own because for instance after you make that profit on your first place that money will have to be held by a third party until you purchase your next real estate investment\nSo talk to your real toward about all your investment plans and asked them which attorneys and accountants in your area will be able to guide you through at ten thirty one like kind of exchange you know many people have real estate investments they might buy a house but keep the one they were living in and then rent it out and that's great\nBut if you really want to grows an investor and create a really big real estate portfolio\nExperts said the ten thirty one like kind of exchange is the way to go as I said it's the big leagues of real estate investing and there's no reason that you can't use it on your path to being set for life [noise]\nComing up next week on real estate today we'll move to the other side of the spectrum and our special show retiring wealthy will look at how real estate can help

to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... to stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June of old nine\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself over time time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired are retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of them and say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody oh don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show is Jim on where we talked about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect which you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten till\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening and talking about you [noise] um I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive being thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a ... right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so Laura heard this and she sent me an email we have the best\nI can tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK\nAnyway let's talk about in this house and an eight all over again okay so you know I Want to go back to um you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October ish and all that and at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but there were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically\nAnd at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally of fell off a cliff\nSo is this like that I'm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs\nThat no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWill basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raise interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week at the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff\nYou know what it does do in my view it should be a wake up call to you\nBecause did you know did you see how fast it fell\nI mean it was like what eleven hundred points in two days I mean that's fast the market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly\nI mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did in Y. two K. or ... and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that duty or ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and you are contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you says oh there's

that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we not work with over a thousand\nFour hundred families are in in forty three states and you know what it never ceases to our and me and

advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and that's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning as our primary focus\nAnd so that's you we love to help you if we could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all\nAbout the topics of a retirement planning and ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the areas the probably the most important a decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two and Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits\nIf the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take your sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy so an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is it is the\nLife expectancy so you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine\nSo so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be so the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity and by delaying you'll walk up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefits because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay there's a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at uh we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon

number will help you to calculate you have enough money to retire on\nOkay that's the big question we'll also talk about five strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes when you retire we'll talk about how to maximize your cash flow okay so when you are retired it's in my opinion is all about cash flow you got to make sure you have the cash coming in to cover the lifestyle that you

of the show you can go back and listen to a we have articles on retirement planning topics we have videos on the same so we have all kinds of stuff on there that I think you can benefit from\nUm this is a part of the show where we talk about estate planning we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs\nThe fruits of your labor and we do this because money isn't everything but it sure keep the kids didn't touch does it not right on the sports happy\nAnd that's what we want we want happy squirts\nLadies and gentleman you don't want to see unhappy squirts that's not a good thing okay so we weren't happy squirts anyway this is a time when we talk about estate planning and so we're going to talk about this week the dynasty trust and I think the dynasty trust is one of the most powerful\nEstate planning documents there is I really do and so we can talk about that but before we do it Jack and you play it you know I'd go to let's\n\nSay you you\nKnow my ... may be um\n[noise]\nAnd\nOf course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite we don't want that to happen to you so therefore every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust that will hold\nThe inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes during that entire time so [laughter] wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIs in its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can create it during your lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will show up on your dad they read the will and it says create the trust so it can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it will be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and estate taxes why\nWell because for example let's say that uh you know your your daughter gets a divorce\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trust the inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child they're not so into trust therefore the trust his immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the in the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generation skipping tax trust because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money as trustees your children or whoever you named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support him H. E. M. S.\nAnd you know hams is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance was sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets that they want to leave behind\nDo they're greedy and watched undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if they're real estate or something like that so talk to your ah financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to one of our financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you go to our website it is money matters dot net\nAnd on our website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there\nDorothy guess what people will get they will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunks cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip chips made with ... they form and they formed the chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate and melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or does because our topic trunk\nAnd while you're at it you're learning about your finances man it's a deal you can find nowhere else\nTo go to our website money matters a net now on the off chance that maybe cookies or not what you want to go to us that are for although I Would highly recommend it\nAt the semi we're gonna talk about three of the worst enemies you have to your financial well being we're going to talk about inflation going to talk about income taxes beer markets we'll also talk about how to calculate your magic number which is a if you have enough money to retire on\nWe're going to talk about your cash flow Matt and maximizing cash flow during your retirement we'll talk about what you should be doing with your four one K. right now we'll talk about when you should take Social Security when you're sixty two sixty six when you're Seventy we're going to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want to tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits and we know show you how to beat that if it's at all possible we have so much information at the center I Can't even tell you all about it right now but go to our website money matters dot net\nSign up for the seminar and we'll look forward to seeing you there you know what I can not believe how fast the show has gone it's over already I Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I enjoy doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] information presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis of a sudden your hands and not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned none of this show's content viewed as personalized investment by a professional\nAdvisor city can solve them more implementing any of the strategies presented\nNumerous times and other methods involve varying degrees of risk and therefore it can be no ... any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for a client was fully tax\nPlanning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nProfessional regarding your specific legal ...\nFounded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of ... or ...

how it can knock these houses down and I think there's a real issue with\nUm the types of homes that we build them when they go to rebuild this again I think there's a lot of options that we probably should consider in particular\nThe idea of pre cast concrete homes and that technology is there it looks really good\nAnd um you'd be amazed at how sturdy these houses are because they're concrete pre cast walls\nAnd I think that they would really a stand a sand up a lot better to this kind of a a weather of course that kind of forces amazing but it's going to be a heck of a lot stronger than um than a a frame home in the issue there when you think about that as far as it pertains California\nWildfires even earthquakes it's dirty\nA option for sure of one we're talking about um a building homes that can withstand the effects of Mother Nature so I I Want to talk more about that later on and I'm going to get somebody on in the coming weeks that is in that industry because\nI think

mainframe here with you um I Want to talk a little bit about um\nSolar and the affordability of solar joining me on the phone line right now is Michael I'm going to get this right stab vice president of business development for summer on Michael good morning\nMorning how are you\nI'm doing well thanks for having me on the show\nOh thank you very much for joining us um you guys or San Francisco bay homes solar energy company tell me a little bit about son running what you guys do\nYeah so um our CEO injure rich or met her co founder at censor at Stanford business school um and they started the company about ten years ago\nAnd the purpose of the company was suffering affordable clean solar energy to know the residential audience to homeowners\nUm enable them to you know obviously produced their own clean energy save money on their energy bills and just generally make the world a better place or our mission is to create a planet run by the side than we've grown tremendously over the last ten years\nIt is just such an amazing thing and I mean I think most Californians realize the fact that that some beautiful son that everybody lives in California has has such potential but it is that paid back for a lot of people it's it's difficult right it it's it can be unattainable for many\nOr your goal is to make it more affordable how is it that you're able to to do that or what's the plan\nThat's correct so our primary products is a is a solar power purchase agreements and in that way we provide solar as a service to the homeowner we're really not that different from the utility\nOr when you sign up with the utility when you move into a new home you don't have to make a large upfront came it truly just start paying with Bill right do you see your zero down in solar and so\nUh when you sign up et cetera and you don't have any out of pocket\nCosts we put solar panels on your roof we provide you with the energy at a rate typically lower than the utility and then you pass luckily for it\nSo it's just like signing up with the utility yet I Am able to harness the or the power of the sun how are you a are you able to um install a novel panels to power the whole house or Senate the house um what what's the typical install\nYeah that's a great question so the masks on that is really a function of how much space you have and how much energy you need an outstanding every mission equation that sort of balances all those things but on average I'd say California most of our customers are offsetting Ninety percent or more each illegal\nUm that Ninety percent it's amazing\nThat you know 'cause I mean a lot of people or you know across the country you know they'll look at solar and they'll say\nOkay this is great I Want to harness the same but you know I've only I can only offset by twenty percent and I've got this big investments and the payoff takes forever I'm to be able to pull that off is is really quite amazing I Would imagine to Michael\nThe issue is that the solar panels themselves have gotten more efficient as well right\nThey have they have um they've been increasing efficiency by you know ... percent a year a couple of percent a year but that's been going on for many years so it starts to add up all the time um I think at this point they're probably thirty or forty percent more efficient than when I entered the industry I'm sure it's not only seven years ago wow\nThat's amazing um do you remember this report a while ago that talked about solar and how um I mentioned this before you came on the air where if we were to go into the desert and build a hundred mile by a hundred miles solar\nFarm we could probably\nFeed the entire United States of electricity\nSo I I haven't seen that mass um but I can tell you that doesn't sound wrong to me um I got kind of a similar statistic which is that within a few minutes the sun produces enough energy to power the whole planet\nOr just to be like a it's sort of similar that's\nRight you're right right I just think about that right it's incredible to think\nUm tell me or if\nPeople wanted more information Michael about your company and and what it is you can do how do they get a hold of your phone\nSo uh we have a website it's ah WWW dot ... dot com um you know it was pretty easy to find online you can call us our number is readily available and or you know we have you know call centers in people's idea to take the call\nMichael ... vice president of business development for summer on their website is sun run dot com thank you so much for taking the time this morning apologies for a little technical headache up we had the thanks for hanging on\nA new problem thanks for having me\nYou got it I appreciate it eight hundred to two two fifty two twenty two eight hundred to two to five to ... to let's go back to your phone calls right now and see but we can help out a this is max in Newport Beach max you're on march radio morning\nAnd you know I Would argue that I'm a I Would argue that we build them better part of the issue was is the older homes a lot of that lumber that was used was old growth\nAnd so it was slow it was denser and the whole thing about mailing stuff together was that it really held down because it you know these were trees the group for a hundred years now you know the lumber industry it's a crop dislike corn and soybean wheat\nIt's just a crop that we are cultivate every Thirty years and it's not that that would isn't strong but it's not like it was a hundred years ago that's for sure\nIt dries out a whole lot faster I Know yeah it's amazing what shrinking shrinking the amount of straightening you get\nYour ... right because it's just so it's so wet or when it grows and it's so quick that there is a difference in you know it's it's an interesting point when you think about some of these homes that when these terrible storms come you know like they just experience on a Florida North Carolina or even earthquakes that come in California\nPart of that issue of the overall a structure could be the fact that this lumber is not as dance and as hard as it used to be ... that that certainly I think a plausible I'm a plausible thing\nWas true yeah I've I've done ... remodeling myself and and\nYou know you you put some like new would in to the existing wall and all of a sudden the wall shrinks down smaller than the old wall\nOnly have one way out that's now yeah [laughter] where I didn't sit in the edit dip you know now bill and the doorway or something like that and and it's like\nA you know just you know maybe two or three months later all of a sudden you've got this little ended in ...\nOr you know it shows where the roots hair was done or rice is nuts and the rank us fluids\nNo you're absolutely right for the straight male and and the and the nails gonna come straight out I appreciate it yet a rich thanks so much for the call I appreciate your being part of how smart radio our phone number is eight hundred to two two fifty two twenty two eight hundred to two to five to to to\nUh is the numbers that mentioned lenses off this week and she's joined some are and are down in Mexico or let's go to the phone lines again here's Larry Larry you're on how smarts radio morning\nI got a problem I got us doped up by one replace the whole ... too big for thirty eight inch an inch do short for thirty six age and I think a ceramic tile\nSo it's a it's a stove top that set inside of a\nA of a of a cut out in the countertop\nCan we do you have if you were able to cut out the ceramic\nCould you put all the way we say give me the size one more time it's too big for a thirty it's too small for thirty two\nAnd two big for a thirty\nAnd I go to a store and they got thirty and thirty ... right\nAround there and the whole is thirty three edges and I need thirty four\nOkay a ceramic tile because\n... can be caught but do you have the room to cut it in other words what's the cabinet underneath and\nEverything will be okay if if I can get that orange are ever going to be good\nOkay um you have a couple of ways to go there is a a who's going to do this you\nKnow okay a there's a couple of different tools or you know you need a tire guy first to come in and they're going to come in with a cutting tool that'll cut that ceramic out first and they'll just use the diamond blade\nA on a diamond laid on the end of a small little grinder and cut out exactly what you want if you go by that new stove top there'll be a template that the\nThe folks can put down over the top of it they'll cut their ceramic then they'll come back again with a different blade and they'll cut out the top and then you'll have you'll have a little bit larger a cooked up and you had before but it it should work just fine so it absolutely can be caught\nBut there's been there's tile so he\nGoes to ... businessmen cement born underneath their\nRight to put it down to the pile on so that would be kept as some of those Jeanette ...\nIt's going to be a dusty it's going to be a dusty job but it absolutely can be done with the right blades and they can cut it out there and you can put it right over the top\n... children do if they do a right to go to class or break or something\nIf they do it right you shouldn't have any problem whatsoever you need to really you know I I was talking with the earlier caller about the national association with remodeling industry I have nothing to do with that organization other than uh I I'm very familiar with it and the contractors that work there\nAnd so if you go to that um if you go to that website Mary Ann A. R.

sleep in do you have difficulty going off this sleepers dance like\nOh okay awesome and stay okay good I got it All right well see the off to sleep is usually linked to the gall bladder\nSo we'd want to support gall bladder at your body size maybe three teaspoons of gall bladder PG usually the first night you observe you can go off to sleep easier okay I'll show and this you would use for months\nAnd uh after you have used it three weeks you would begin to coffee and them as per week\nNothing will give you more beautiful here and skin that will just do wonders for you and that lasts
