USA Today the editorial\nPeople bear can possibly even a pool of something like that I Know it sort of thing and they get in there that's crazy for NBC News to put Julie sweating like on every member sweating to is represented by Michael ... out excuse me\nA ... that the lawyer for so I always completely ... for for whatever reason so sorry about that but they put her on the air and they gave her a national stage before the interview they say NBC News cannot verify\nAny of the allegations are corroborate anything that the sweating to say so here she is don't kill the inner ear there at that point right obviously the New York times and Brett Kavanaugh through ice\nOn somebody while at college storing a ball that broke out there were no charges made of course and the writer of that story by the way it was an anti capital critic who the paper later had to admit it wasn't even a news report so that I can only go half hours but if I get I can just keep going\nBut all these things what one direction\nEverybody in the media not everybody most or against capital getting confirmed and most didn't want to see it happen in most wanted to create divisiveness because that brings clicks and ratings and that's the whole problem with our country right now our media isn't interested in the truth there are only interested in the bottom line and that is a shame\nWell one of the uh one of the also load some really most load some a media reactions was a political cartoon that was run in the Washington Post\nAnd uh it's a picture of a young girl a kneeling and praying a at her bedside before she goes to bed and it's the caption is Kevin ... daughter says another prayer and here's the prayer dear God\nForgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward so so I mean there really were no holds barred and the thing is\nA ... it was represented there's a story on that I saw on drugs this morning of one of Stephen ... bears writers a woman who had not heard of before who tweeted out she subsequently taken the tweet down that uh well at least we ruined his life uh\n... ... ... and I you know the you know that's that's the constellation prize and by the way I'd like to point out\nThat that was always the objective because the objective here was if you can't defeat the nomination disc ... de legitimize the United States Supreme court or certainly de legitimize Brett Kavanaugh but now that it's a conservative majority you can de legitimize the entire court and this is the\nSort of a this is the uh the poisoning of the well water that really both sides are involved because President Trump certainly does this to anybody who gets in his\nUh bad side he attacks them personally or professionally to de legitimize them as individuals and institutions and the left does it too and my question is how is America's supposed to function\nIf we're going to tear at the very fabric that holds the country together\nOr not [laughter] think of the bottom line I think everybody is going to retreat to their corners it becomes tribal and then the made a best side when and their compromise is a dirty word now that that\nThat's that's never going to happen and I think certainly people were invested in that it's not because yeah All right if you're a conservative yeah a and other conservative on the court more staunch obviously a than than Kennedy ever could be\nA but I think it more was about the fear that\nIf Democrats and the media succeeded in allowing this precedent to happen if Kavanaugh didn't get confirmed and the president being you can accuse somebody of sexual harassment or misconduct or gang rape without one corroborating fitness without any evidence and your succeed and those allegations\nThen all of that do no sane person would ever ever go and pursue a higher office\nOr or the Supreme Court ever again because I say I'm not going through that because anybody can make up the anything and I'm not saying these things are made up but at least you know ... when you put away feelings a look at the facts ... there was there was no evidence\nThat that that's a scary thing that this this could happen to anybody and you'd think this is bad wait till the twenty twenty elections and all the things right to come out about people and what they did in high school and college or allegedly did it is disturbing\nAnd well you know also you know obviously if there were a way to prove that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted\nA Christina bless you for that would be a very different situation there was no way to prove it obviously a but ... everybody was acting as if Seventeen to Twenty one year old Brett Kavanaugh was being appointed to the Supreme Court and\nThat's the thing they they keep calling him an alcoholic well how how he's sixteen oil in life that is even consider the Supreme Court\nAnd here's alone and that makes me an alcoholic too that I guess well the the\nThe bottom line is there just isn't any indication that whatever however much he likes beer or there's no indication that it ... it that it interferes with his performance of his duties or his life as an adult and ... and by the way we've had you know\nWe've had a lot of heavy drinkers perform at a very high level or in many many aspects of life or that the ... there there just isn't any indication that Brett Kavanaugh is an alcoholic\nOr that again as certainly as an adult that there's been any inappropriate actions in any way shape or form related to his interaction with women\nSo I again if you ... the tide goes to the base runner if you're\n... if if there's no way to prove ... there's no way to substantiate\nUh Christine Blasey Ford's allegation then what are we supposed to do just simply ... destroyed a this man's life over an unsubstantiated allegation and now brand him forever as a as a sexual assault with a gang rape is\nRight exactly and and then then you add mob rule ruling as well I I'm going to Washington ... senators now they they need security they came to walk over to the Senate building over to the capital and it just there's moms everywhere waiting to pounce on people I think that's the way that there are there going to accomplish\nWhat they're going to accomplish and again the precedent here is is a very scary thing that we're we're going to if this exceeded then even though you're right they did succeed Democrats in terms of any of the G O P now as as anti women in pro gang rape I mean that that's there\nYou've got you've got to allowing the cultural battle\nTo of nine Supreme Court justices now are tainted with sexual ... you know impropriety allegations\nA you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg has like a kind of graphic documentaries running on CNN twenty four hours a day turning into with action figures and she's a pop culture icon and ... why because what made her interesting was her friendship with Antonin Scalia\nBut they didn't make a documentary of Antonin Scalia they made a documentary about Ruth Bader Ginsburg she's a secular saint and the Republicans are gang rape is\nHe right about that and then look again ... I thought it was a complete BS when when Republicans would bring up well President Obama admitted it ...\nTotally or you know ... right it's ridiculous\nAnd George W but she is an alcoholic as he got a DUI like Thirty years ago you know so it's funny how that works but even like better or for instance that the guy running for Senate against Ted Cruz of Texas He had a DUI and reportedly left the scene of the accident in his twenties and then everybody say yeah but that was a long time ago and you know he's learned from it sets a look look\nWhat a good person he is that well okay you have to apply that to people you don't like to if that's that's the new\nOil out of fortune limit but I mean it's like eight showers from this what it's all done I mean everybody ... people anyway now unless we're\nTalking with Joe ... the hills media reporter the hill dot com I'm\nOne of the law of unintended consequences that kicks in here is that uh the left was counting on the Kavanaugh nomination to energize the base and it may very well have done that but what they didn't expect was how much energy it may have given to the Republicans\n[noise] every poll shows that enthusiasm a month ago I think was Wall Street journal NBC News Saturday sixty three\nPercent enthusiasm on the Democratic side fifty three percent on the Republican side now that's turned upside down and Republicans are even with Democrats and they will go to the polls because they were reminded once again of what they're up against here that if you're a Romney or or McCain and you run for president and you try to play nice with the press and you try to run a campaign\nYou're going to get stampede it's like they were and and as you get criticized drop and God Knows I have in terms of his demeanor but he seems to be the right guy for the right time now because at least the punches back and and voters Republican voters will be punching back because of the white capital and his family were treated because remember

that's going to put a whole new spin on happy hour [laughter] wow the girl I tell you something you can't say you could say a lot of things about the show but one thing you can't say it's not informative\nBut it might be worth it even if you don't like your in laws because like senior ...\nRight exactly what I tell it aging in place or in other words there are a lot of a for instance high rise apartment buildings in New York and I assume that some of them in in some of the new high rises in Los Angeles has the same option\nOr because they're very upscale\nThe buildings have a services provided that you come to you that came back on everything and to your apartment and as you get older instead of having to move into a board and care\nYou essentially can quote unquote age in place right where you are which I think most people would find they die early do for sure\nUh but this is a there's an additional benefit to this to\nOne of the things Americans as a lot of things well one of the things we don't do well\nAnd it's represented almost a perfectly by Randy way out is respect our elders trying I respect me out there you know you don't have we don't take care of them no no they send them all you have all of the arrogance of every thirty year old punk in the history of the world including myself when I was a thirty year old punk\nBecause the thing is when you're twenty and Thirty years old\n... think that that's a permanent condition that you're always going to be on the cutting edge of hypnosis every American to be young every generation things they personally invented sex\nThat ah that nothing's ever been funny until they were funny and their friends were funny and this is ... is this is true\nFor ever it's always been true every generation is convinced\nThat those dinosaurs that are clogging up their future mom and dad hats should just go away those people would just die and get out of the way\nThey screwed everything up looking out screwed up everything as well that part's true well in some cases that is true but the bottom line is is that it has always been that way but we don't we what we do is we don't respect as seniors we don't respect the past\nWere not interested in it remember this is the new world and therefore anything with the world old Oldsmobile went out of business right Edward old in front of we don't like saying used cars it's previously owned we come up with all these euphemisms\nEr on court additions instead of reruns\nYou know anything that is in the past were not interested in as a result we're culturally ignorant of our history and worse than that we're oftentimes ignorant of our family history because we shunted grandma and grandpa off to a nursing home or to a retirement village or they chose to move to some place in Florida\nWhere you know they drive running golf carts and I wanted to get away from you people there's something to\nBe said for that to a so it's not all one way but the bottom line is is that you're there there's a wonderful film that was made by Barry Levinson a many years ago and I'm blanking on the name right now\nBut uh I'll look it up real quick a and a ... it was the story of a guy who came to America in Nineteen fourteen\nAnd uh he tells the story of his uh of his experience from father to son and then you see the great grandkids a TV comes into the house in the new start to see a communication breakdown because instead of talking to each other or what happens is they uh\nUh they're watching television and find it a last scene of the film is she's in a nursing home with his great grandson and a Thanksgiving Day parade is on the Macy's day parade is on and Avalon is the name of the movie and\nInstead of a listening to is the old band starts to tell a story about I came to America Nineteen fourteen the kid staring at television not hearing it and you can see that that's the moment where this family history and that this story will not pass on any never be burned again here\nAnd the thing is is that we've broken that chain earlier and earlier and earlier and this isn't an odd way because of the housing costs of the change of cost of modern life\nActually may help keep that connective tissue alive\nSo there could be a real unintended upside to this six fifty for talk radio seven ...\nThis is John Green and if your teeth or

Dr Drew in Lawrence along\nAnd as a as Susan Collins said during her a speech on Saturday or maybe the only good thing that can come from this will be a you know that this is the bottom that it can't go any lower than it went this time\nAnd that we can find some way to pull back and have a confirmation process it actually provides the service that it's supposed to provide which is give us insight into who were putting on the Supreme Court\n[noise] or not [laughter]\nThat process was extremely ugly I'd never seen anything like that no one's ever really say that they like it that made that the closest second what eighty a combination of Clarence Thomas and made a hill hearings but this was was even more\nUgly than that it's it's for those who remember that the Anita Hill hearing so we thought that the whole issue of sexual misconduct or harassment was dealt with it that time but it came back in technicolor and we know now that\nIt was not a final word then ... and going on for a long time and the at least a\nOne of the other thing Susan Collins said was that and they'd be more women will come forward now and report their assault well\nI don't know if that's going to happen when you consider the consequences that Dr Ford had to suffer I mean she was humiliated by the president at a rally a who mocked her and uh\nYou know it just there's still a lot of people who don't believe her and she received death threats and her family had to leave their home because they were being threatened it's just the worst possible scenario the latest laid out\nYeah and unfortunately you know Brett Kavanaugh's also had death threats and you you know ... you can go to dinner anymore without the risk of having protesters track them to restaurants and\nScream at them and threaten them and you know the the now that sticks up gets hammered down in and the whole social media phenomenon has made this so much worse\nBecause it allows people to ... to first of all to stock people or their movements post there whereabouts in real time\nUh expose their what they called doc seeing their home addresses their phone numbers their family members where they work where they like to hang out oh we saw a situation where in New York Mayor Bill de Blasio who uh has a regular workout routine as part of his the way he lives his life\nAnd and people routinely uh come up to him while he's in the gym working out and again in his face on whatever issue was their cause the lab\nAnd uh apparently over the weekend to somewhat of a woman who was a homeless advocate got and build a blog goes face and now he's a villain for saying I'm not talking to you about this right now it's just I I'm doing ... ... ... and you know the thing is is that there's an entitlement that activists\nHave of of all ilk that they they feel empowered to personalize these things and encroach into people's home lives and they because they elevated every issue into a moral imperative and this is left and right\nOr they of elevated every issue in life and death therefore there's no compromise there's no compromise possible if if everything is a matter of a either a divine law or some kind of secular equivalent they're off\nThen you cannot you're making a deal with the devil to compromise and if that's going to be the standard going forward the country's not sustainable we solve this happened in Eighteen sixty one and it wasn't pretty for the next four years\n[noise] no it doesn't and you were talking about ... somebody posted online um majority leader Mitch McConnell's home address both his whole and ISI and at home and the whole state of Kentucky and\nThat was very ugly they were waiting for him when he came out the front door protesters they were having a keg or outside of his home or two days before the vote and a mocking uh Brett Kavanaugh\nFor uh the whole thing that came up and his hearing about how he drank and college and high school if he drank in college and high school it was just a um it was a situation where they were trying to confront him directly and it isn't the first time this has happened\nOh no housing is happening or Tibet it's happened quite a bit yeah and you know the thing is is that now that the passion the immediate crisis as past if you will uh I I mean we really do need to have a national conversation about\nAh obviously if Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of sexual assault back kicks this into a whole\nDifferent discussion but this whole obsession with drinking with his youthful drinking\nWere not appointing Seventeen year olds are Twenty one year old Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court he's a fully formed human adults in his fifties who has a thirty five thirty year ... thirty year anyway track record of professional success with zero indication\nThat there's any impact negative on his life both personally and professionally or colleagues or people in cow just because of alcohol\nAnd there is zero indication that he's at any\nUntoward incident involving women as a fully functional adults and we've got to at some point you know again we can't be such hypocrites that Beto O'Rourke can run for the Senate\nIn Texas and his a DUI and fleeing the scene of an incident uh from Thirty years ago is well that's something that you know what happened in the past and it's a long time ago and\nUh it really isn't relevant to him today if that's the standard for him\nHow can that not be the center for other people ... what is this selective out and vice versa there are people on the writer will point out Brock Obama you know smoking pot or using coke that he acknowledged and in one of his memoirs or\nYou know I Am back we can keep going through time where people are selectively outraged by the behavior of others and you know at some point we've got to say stop this this is this is a ... this is outrageous demagoguery\nWell this just speaks to the ugliness of the process of the current society in which we live people of the certain freedom to say whatever they want and host whatever they want on social media and think about the consequences well there are credits consequences and ah and went and seen that playing out\nWell you know there's a story and this is just want to me this is representative as a writer for 'em as Steven called bear who tweeted out she tweeted out while at least we ruined his life\nOr a you know a ... and and as if that's an accomplishment but you see to me Linda and again this is you know one man's opinion but I think that this has been the game that has been played with it it wasn't invented by Donald Trump put in the era of Trump it's come to a fruition\nThat the standard in America now seems to be that you de legitimize your opposition uh it ... and that way even if they when they have no moral authority to the office they hold and Donald Trump does that individuals who does it institutions of the press being first and foremost the fake media\nBut the Democrats do it too\nAnd that's what they've done here with the Supreme Court if they could stop Brett Kavanaugh and they couldn't prevent the Republicans from having the majority on the court which you can do is de legitimize the conservative court while you got CNN running low auditory documentaries about Ruth Bader Ginsburg here's to a Republican appointees were sexual predators\nClarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh\nSo you couldn't have a bigger you know everybody was upset about the tenor and tone of Brett Kavanaugh's\nPartisan attack\nA during his last testimony but Ruth Bader Ginsburg blasted the president of the United states uh and of course she apologized and all is forgiven so the thing is that the double standard is the standard while the Republicans are criticizing this terrible process they didn't even allow Merrick Garland to have a process\nThey didn't give him the benefit of a phoney baloney confirmation process and reject him even though he

mites viruses pollution habitat loss and pesticides and herbicides or all considered factors that contribute to colony collapse\nAnd they believe that there may be something in these uh mushrooms that could actually help stabilize the bee population which would be a huge step forward and that's a level of knowledge that is so deep dish thank God there are people who study that stuff that's\nThe thing I think that story as well water there are people smarter than me\nYeah and there are people doing amazing things you know that are just so specific every once in a while you stumble across

is that it's one and done like all major front runners I mean people who have big leads\nIn elections Gavin Newsom has zero interest in debating ... Cox because the only thing that can come from this as he makes them kind of a colossal blunder and all of a sudden gives oxygen\nOr to a candidate that he's got a huge lead over so as a general rule uh the front runners if they really believed that they've they've got the election and the bags they don't like to do these debates they only do one debate so that they can check the box and not have the empty chair on stage and all of that show business that goes in politics\nHe didn't want to debate in the primaries because he had such a big lead\nAnd Dianne Feinstein is not going to be debating a Kevin deli on and they won't be any Kevin daily yeah ah so the bottom line is is that a John Cox is going to get his one shot and he's a formidable\nCandidate he's not a not he isn't saying stupid things there's plenty of a real issues in California to talk about\nThat ah of course Gavin Newsom isn't going to bring up in terms of make it a\nA oh say ownership of a policy of the Democratic leadership at the state's Carson and there's a lot of issues that cut across party lines like the gas tax like\nUh the uh the the uh for you know the rent control bill which is the the only thing that's going to have enough ... ten passes what's going to happen it was a piece in the LA daily news over the weekend that says it beautifully or you're going to see a rash of landlords converting rental units to condominiums\nThey're just going to get out to going to get out of rental game and and it'll be ten minutes after Gavin Newsom was sworn in when you're going to see the Sacramento legislature start to push for some kind of a bill to limit uh landlords from converting to condominiums I mean once you get in telling private property owners what they can and can't do with their property\nSo there's issues the bullet train another issue that John Cox should make a meal out of because Gavin Newsom is on record as saying of course it's a terrible plan and we're going to build it anyway\nBut doesn't all Gavin Newsom need to do is say well John Cox indoors by Donald Trump\nThat's right as a general that conventional wisdom says that that's all he needs to do however what does conventional about wisdom and twenty Eighteen\nAnd drew I got a point out one correction though this isn't a debate NPR actually said we're calling this a come for say a car and got it [noise]\nThe protests continue even after new U.S Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh swearing in on Saturday justice ... has been accused by several women of sexual harassment correspondent Abby Philip reports President Trump will conduct his own swearing in ceremony for Kavanaugh\nDespite the fact that judge Kavanaugh was sworn in formally over the weekend he will also hosts for a swearing in ceremony for like the White House later this afternoon and meanwhile I haven't I've expected to be hearing a case is that the Supreme Court starting tomorrow\nWell a cabinet how about this a turn of events he gets confirmed and his first day on the job as a holiday\nBecause after that or if the day off a cause I think it's\nStill Columbus Day in Washington DC although I'm not sure about that does he get his robe fit into the courts are closed today open tomorrow and Kavanaugh will uh take his seat on the bench now here's something that was lost in all of the uh ... over the weekend that is significant\nUh and and I think it speaks well for them a number of the uh current achieved a Supreme Court justices showed up for Kavanaugh swearing in ceremony behind closed doors including Atlanta Kagan a fact let me do a quick search here which justices\nOr showed up for Kavanaugh's ah swearing in\nI should have done this before the show by the way I'm aware of that I'm aware that this uh but it just occurred to me that it's worth noting\nA and um [noise] it\nWasn't me with her at Harvard yes Alina Kagan hired Brett Kavanaugh when she was the dean of the law school there and he uh\n... and and he was a one of the instructors she was she was his boss she hired him\nSo John Roberts gave the oath of office and a Justice Kennedy of course we're retired\nUh he came to the court or for the swearing in ceremony on oil and a Kagan was there and I believe at least one of the other a liberal justices was also there are I'm having trouble finding it some ... G Ruth Bader Ginsburg look at that the notorious or was there a\n... and it is nice and it's significant so yes because this is symbolic it's symbolic and it says look a controversies aside the court the Supreme Court must go forward we must have the umpires on the field\nAnd we got to show that we're above all that part is all\nRight it's gone on and remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg had her own issue in terms of partisanship when she blasted Donald Trump and then had to walk that back\nSo it's not just Brett Kavanaugh mouth and all of a partisan politics so anyway I I Do think that that's a significant thing that happened over the weekend that got lost and all of the controversy that the court itself\nA witch protecting itself if you will in a sign of bipartisanship that uh they realize everything you've been talking about Doug [laughter] yeah I Know how important and that is is really important going forward [noise]\nNew York governor Andrew Cuomo excuse me jumping one go ahead you

you know who knows what spoofing is David Lazarus he's with us right now the morning David how are you\nGood morning I'm good thanks what the hell is spoofing it's not moving let me start\nRight now trying to\nKnow about that let's just move right on okay I got here if he tried to keep this on a higher plane in this regard\nBetcha yes but the thing is really insidious and I'll bet you everybody listening to this has had an audience of it it's something that telemarketers used and it's a way of getting around your caller i._d. system by having a bogus number appear on the caller i._d. screen\nNow sometimes it might be something like you know your local police department or a local hospital or your local school something that that has uh an aura of trust around it\nBut the technology has been improving to the point now or telemarketers are able to spoof local numbers in your area maybe even your neighbors are people you know and so that number comes up on the screen you think oh it's George and glad it far I haven't talked to them in a while and you pick up the phone and it's not them it's some telemarketer\nAnd so it completely makes the caller i._d. system useless\nNow I I of course we've experienced this to where like the first three digits of our home phone number shows up with some of the numbers and well that must be in the neighborhood\nBut here's the question I have cars weekend a lot of these calls it the house\nAnd a ... most of them are our ... our boss so which by the way as another term that no one knows what the hell we're talking about Twenty years ago\nBut on the phone rings you didn't answer it you go hello and then you hear that sort of click and there's it's total silence and I'll Wait I'm Out until uh they hang up on the machine hangs up\nWhat benefit is there to these telemarketers\nBy just I mean I I'm trying to figure out we're who knows how\nAre they making any money from any of this to keep this operation go who staying on the phone to give them their security number\n[laughter] clearly enough people that it's worthwhile for them unfortunately many seniors get duped by these sorts of things you know there are folks who got lots of time on their hands they might be a little bit lonely and they don't get a lot of calls and so the phone rings and it's kind of an exciting thing it's a damn shame out\nTwo things happen when you're picking up a call like this either it's going to commit to an automated system which might take a moment for it to kick into gear because first you know ... it has to confirm that you're on the line and then the system starts up and then it's going to lead you down some track that probably\nIs going to lead you to press one and then you're going to talk to a live person or a live person coming right out of the gate but let's face it they don't have enough live people in their call center so again you're going to get that\nPause as the system waits for one of their operators to say oh we got to live on on the line and then they pick up and that's what's going on with that pause\nA we're talking with David Lazarus whose piece appeared in the business section of the LA Times FCC such a huge fun on telemarketers court spoofing but the industry still needs to step up our I define thirty seven point five million that's a pretty big fine I'm sure there'll be

Banksy\nPainting of a girl with a balloon and\nIt sold for one point four million dollars banks yeah of course the sort of mysterious street artist\nAnd the second the gavel came down\nOr all of a sudden the artwork in its frame which was it was framed by banks himself starts to move down\nTowards the floor inside the frame and shreds [laughter] so I'm a paper shredder was built into the frame should have seen the look on people's they hadn't ... and\nThe uh the gallery owner of the the auctioneers at Sotheby's grab the the the the\nAverage are also at all is it still shredding and I assume that it was a remotely activated by an app\nOr say a built in the technology is fantastic it's a Banksy pranks the\nYeah they showed him doing it he he'd been thinking about that for a long time and it was like all these little razor blades that he had put into it they didn't get any native video of building yeah the paper shredder into the army so he ... you know years ago to make this happen\nAnd uh and pulled it off brilliantly now the thing is Randy you called it a prank and I guess it could be dismissed as a prank but really what it is is\nWas the artwork now what they are the whole purpose of the painting was to do that mhm so in it was this in essence this is what it's called performance art but it was ... now\nWhat's astonishing is that there is there's an argument over ... did the person who bought this thing for one point four million is it actually worth ... people some people are saying it's worth doubling what he or she I don't know the owner for shredding\nA painting you what do you do have an alternate frame with banks he's known for a lot of things if that's the case then my wife is ... she's got that paper shredder don't every five minutes and the and

drum circles and drum circles or\nThe the this used to be Columbus Day in Los Angeles and it was Columbus Day across America accept a lot of Venus apologies have ah have bailed on Columbus Day because Columbus might've sale the ocean blowing fourteen hundred Ninety two\nBut he was mean did I get you write that\nColumbus ohio doesn't celebrate Columbus that were wrecked Denver was the first major city that I remember hearing of that uh bailed on Columbus Day but it's pretty common this did not happen remember the bill de Blasio the mayor of New York was talking about uh getting rid of Columbus Day in New York and the Italian or community said\nI don't think so that I don't think so I don't think that's going to happen to miss the\nMayor of Denver if they can and gave it up did they still keep the kids get off a school like did they change it with a different name yeah they've got an indigenous people say oh hey I say our end that indigenous people say is very specific and very\nA political there's a lot ... a a lot on the table behind the radicals who pushed for indigenous peoples that\nBecause Columbus was not just being hauled off the pedestal because he was a bad guy in Columbus was a bad guy he was a tough game by fifteenth century stand he was a tough character a ... he he did not set out\nTo a spread disease and to enslave people he was spread he would he was setting out to find a sea route to the indies\nStumbled into the Caribbean islands had no idea where it was but the amazing thing is he made it back to Europe but he did this four times so we never really was sure of where he was and he did all that without Google Maps he did it without longitude which is quite a feat\nTo sail with only using latitude\nA and to be able to find your way home is pretty amazing ah the fifteenth century was an ugly ugly time All right there were no enlightened humanitarians and the fourteen hundreds so let's cross that off the list a\nThere are no gluten free begins no there was no artesian well actually I probably was artesian was certainly natural food products but part of the food we are human beings because the curve Reeves that the Caribbean is named after we're cannibals ... and the other indigenous peoples who lived in the Caribbean islands were terrified of the curry leaves\nIt was a it was a tough world that Columbus sailed into and he was a tough guy sailing into a tough\nWorld where we celebrating the courage today\nHey indigenous people so uh the the why is it indigenous people's day instead of Native American deck\nAnd why couldn't we have both for instance why couldn't we of Columbus Day because whether it was a good guy or a bad guy he is undeniably an enormously significant person because the sequence of events around Columbus is journeys changed the history of the world\nIn ways that leaf Eric since trip in the year one thousand didn't ... Erickson was in Vineland up a Newfoundland at least five hundred years before Columbus and there may have been people\nWho sailed on reading graphs from Africa even before Li ferrets and it's entirely possible that is what for higher dog was showing with the ... the dish\nOr the Mormons think Jesus was here like a thousand and a half years ago or so there you go\nThe point is when Columbus ah Columbus is voyage of voyages I should say uh introduced a\nAn endless succession of travelers from Europe and from the western world uh or I shouldn't say from the old world to the new world and it and and and it never went back\nThere was no unrestrained about and that forever changed\nHistory of the world so it's a hugely significant event bought the radicals who one of the top of Columbus weren't really gunning for Columbus as much as their gumbo gunning for western civilization itself\nAnd that's where a indigenous people's day comes from because I think most Americans would overwhelmingly support a Native American holiday mhm is absolutely undeniably hugely significant\nThe millions of people who lived in this hemisphere prior to Columbus and and after Columbus the a cultural contributions or someone to even talk about the political contributions the ear required conference et cetera I personally believe that's a little bit overblown but nonetheless\nA hugely significant\nBut that's not what the radicals wanted they didn't want Native American Native American holiday they wanted indigenous people stay because that's pre Columbian that X glued western civilization from this hemisphere and that's what they're really all about and that's a very radical notion\nA and that's what the city council dead and many city councils and communities around the country are doing\nAnd uh you know again because we're so historically ignorant in this country we don't teach the accurate history of the country and that should include Columbus is warts and all and uh the atrocities that were and injustices that were committed on the native peoples of this country except for you teach the truth\nAnd the truth shell sets you free but when you don't have any base
