we covered this story when Mitch Englander LA city councilmember one of the few who speaks to us by the way I announced surprise announcement that he was going to leave the city council early to take a job in the private sector\nAnd that wasn't totally shocking when you thought about imaging Linder had made a run for the LA county board of supervisors that came up short\nAnd it turned out and there's no obvious a political office he doesn't want to go and sit in Sacramento is an assembly minute or something like that so he's going to get a a plum position for sports and entertainment conglomerate\nAnd okay fine but then the LA Times reports that the night before that announcement he hosted in eight hundred dollar per person fund raiser for his office account\nLet's talk about it with one of the investigative reporters who broke the story covers LA city hall for the LA Times welcome back to the show David ... or\nDavid how are ya I'm pretty good how are you I'm fine thanks for coming on this is perfectly legal but boy it's perfectly ugly [laughter] well so\nAs you mentioned uh the counseling which I Wonder you know a week ago today that he's leaving his post he's leaving a at the end of the year even though he's got two more years left in this term\nAnd well we didn't know until very recently is that the night before he did hold this fundraiser at San Antonio winery near downtown LA and from what we are the people who showed up I had no idea he was stepping down the next day so he's raising money for this office holder account and that's a for those of you\nDon't know it's a fund that a politician to city hall can use to spend on meetings at restaurants or foreign trips or they can donate it to nonprofits we don't know how much he raised and we want until January um but under the city's laws he can raise about a hundred thousand a year this way\nSo so he has eventually and then the next day\nYou know bam a you know that he's leaving\nAnd uh once the course the LA Times exposed this the council men said that ah anybody who wants a refund will be given a refund\nBut the question is is the ethics of not informing\nThe people in advance that he was leaving out as I understand it he he argues that well\nThe vet was planned well before he knew about the new job and that may very well be the case but by the time it's the night before it may be the eyes aren't the final I's are dotted the cheese aren't cross but you have a pretty good idea that you're not going to be there so your fundraising for watch\n[noise] well uh what he said in the invitation was that he needed it\nTo uh the money to communicate with his constituents he does have about a ten weeks left he didn't mention but at least part but he did mention communicating with his constituents um and when we contacted the office after we learned of the fundraiser they said well this was going to pay for a community events\nAnd office expenses racked up through the end of the year [noise] um and you know they did say that they informed uh\nThey informed owners before we contacted them they said they told them they would give a refund anybody who asks you know but the thing is\nHe is still going to be there till the end of the year so he can have an influence on things involving people who gave the money\nAnd also I Would point out the host of his fundraiser with council president her lesson who ain't going anywhere from what I can see so I mean there could be risks to actually asking for a refund\nWell and here's the issue that this really raises a and we're talking about David ... of the LA Times ... times dot com\nI David ... the real reason that this story resonates with me and I think so many people as it is a window into the weeds of how city government actually works\nThe fact of the matter is is that if you're funding\nA the functioning of your office to a ... a donations from people who have business before the city or would like to have influence at city hall then if you're buying a level of access\nIs that the regular citizens don't have\nAnd uh you know and frankly some of the some of the city council is not just ... all of them do it and they use some of that money for quote unquote charitable uh giving where let's say there's a church the church band broke down and they throw a couple of thousand bucks towards getting the

Dodger Stadium on Thursday after and equipment bell function no injuries were reported\nOne good thing they want and again going on while they tried to land\nWell Tim ... that's his name right to produce yeah OK to mind Brunner a\nSays that he immediately goes into some kind of conspiracy theory he thought that this was\n'cause it's a tourist helicopter it was a valley city around the country that it was some tour operator giving their passengers a little extra lucky Lou Dodger Stadium me and I pointed out and said well let's put it this way if he faked an emergency landings are go plop

driving\nCalling for state and federal regulators to do more to tackle the growing problem estates grapple with prescription drug abuse and adapt more permissive stances on pots let's talk about it with a very ... group\nGood lawyer this is interesting because it's right on the heels of Canada legalizing nationally um recreational use of marijuana and in Canada and Alton provinces the police are allowed to pull people over\n... without really any cause it just because they may be weaving uh you know but and and to test them a roadside test a sobriety test to see if their impaired I'm ... and what the NTSB or what a states are asking for\nIs that the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nFor new standards on ... and in New devices new guidance on how to tackle in combat this drug impaired driving issue uh in in a lot of that stems back to last year as deadly bus crash in Texas where\nA man and a pickup truck on both marijuana and anti anxiety medication slammed head on into a bus killing Thirteen people so it is it is a problem the NTSB is trying to address it uh and states are calling on that board to do what they can to help\nUh what's also a a factor here is a there was a report I saw yesterday it said that pot smokers need to separate five hours from the time they took up\nA until they operate a motor vehicle no pot smokers doing that I Know but that's the problem and and the the states that have a legalize specifically Colorado where there's more data\nHave legalized recreational pot there's been a very significant increase in traffic not just the accidents but the talent these\nUh since pot has been legalized and that's you know ... not only predictable it was predicted it's just simple if you legalize something that impairs people you're going to have more people\nCross the line uh we we also Jim have a real peculiarity now is that a\nCandidate has legalized pot because in the state of Washington are\nYou know northern neighbor a recreational pot is also a legal so it's legal in Canada and it's legal in a Washington so you figure okay if you're a Canadian and you want to drive from Canada into Washington or you're in Washington you want to drive up to Canada\nAnd cross the border what's the problem well the problem is the border is federal property so\nWhen you go through the border crossing now you got to be in compliance with the United states federal law which of course is different from the Canadian laws on part and the state laws in Washington\nYet I mean yes that that's that's the problem with the the us not having a national drug policy I mean I mean marijuana legal marijuana policy and that was a concern that I was brought up by folks in Canada um even people who want to cross into Michigan or Washington as you say so\nUh yeah it is it's it's something that people need to be aware of um I don't think I Would imagine we're going to see a a fewer arrests up in that area or at least the seizure of marijuana from people trying to cross a either way really because as you say that is that's federal territory that border\nAll right thanks so much Jim appreciate her fellow gym on Twitter at ... news that's R

ethics university looked at sets of identical twins where one of the siblings was heterosexual they found that the homosexual twin tended to have a greater distance between the length of their index and ring\nFinger with the difference most pronounced among women\nI give this study of a middle finger [noise] yeah and there's a lot of flooding I think it has to do more with what you put the finger [noise]\n[laughter] one\nDollar\nFlight Ninety moms of that place and you're lucky true what\nYour next shot in a brand is coming up in just seconds so even here\nIn Los Angeles county cumulus station\nTo\nThat would GI Joe animated series et cetera but I'm ... and often times with that what we used to call in uh the Hollywood term the tent pole movies\n... ... if you'd go see at the theater and then six months to a year later you could go ride on it at a theme park at universal or someplace they turn a movie into a ride like the Harry Potter series et cetera so the crossover is an unusual but could you talk to us Jan about what's going on in the toy industry itself\nThat so many companies who are in that business are struggling or having to reinvent themselves\nWell there's only two players has grown to tell them how rose almost three times the size of Mattel and we all thought at some point in time they'd be one company I still suspect that you're better off if they were because it's just a tougher business now why is it a tougher business because right now there is only three people to sell to Wal Mart\nTarget and Amazon none of the three of them are easy to sell to the point of view of making money because they all understand the toys as the fourth quarter business\nAnd for two of those three traffic is the name of the game and what they want you to do is come in the store so they're willing to sell the toys that about any price to make traffic so it got much\nFor some Toys R us which at one point was the largest seller of toys in the country has gone away because toys was the last full price seller of toys that sold them seriously twelve months a year nobody else\nDoes and then I didn't stop and Toys R us because they were the most expensive so I never went in the store for that reason well this hour on line fascinating\nBecause uh my wife and I made a couple of a feature documentaries\nAnd we sell them through Amazon and Amazon charges a pretty much an arm and a leg to small retailers of small sellers of product like us and they also charge the stocking fees and we have to go through this ridiculous ritual with them where once a year they send us back\nWhatever inventory is on the shelf in the warehouse and then we have to re packet and send it back to them I have no idea what this is about\nBut the bottom line is ... how did the big companies they how does a ... or how did it Toys R us sells through our toy company has Roma tell how do they move their products through Amazon I Can't imagine that they're paying the same kind of freight that we were paying or we pay on a on a on a one off product\nYou know the small players are paying like twenty percent I don't know what you were paying but it's pretty common to have to pay twenty percent to Amazon\nBut remember if you were selling it to a store and the old days you were selling it for fifty cents and the store was selling it for a dollar so getting it for twenty percent on Amazon is not as bad as it sounds on the other hand a lot of people really hate the arm and a leg\nPart of pain Amazon which is one of the reason is the third party business at Walmart is growing so fast\nBecause Wal Mart's giving people a little better deal because they'd really like to grow their online business\nBut that wouldn't apply to big players like has rowing and Mattel I advise a couple of big brands that sell through Amazon and you know they're selling a small percentage points not twenty percent so I don't know what the deal is that ... has ruined Mattel out but I can tell you it's nothing like what you were fighting\nBut that doesn't change the fact that\nIt's not a full price business most of the time when you're looking at places like Wal Mart target and Amazon where it was a toys are us made all one more player in the business a huge player in the business and somebody that sold toys all year long to\nPress or to the public and got a lot of press for doing it so they're always out marketing the product getting you to come to the store even if you're a cohort they didn't come to the store\nAnd of course nobody else was coming to the story there and there but it's just starting to slow down because big box category killers started to die\nTen years ago and Toys R us went out of business where they were highly leveraged and bought out by you know the private equity firms but they were going down either way from the point of view of competitiveness\nWe're talking with Jeff and who is the CNBC retail analyst and CEO of genuine worldwide enterprises in the website there is J. R. K. W. W. dot com I Jen how does the demise of Sears factor into this or is it a just a a just a a sidebar\nSears dropped from fifty four billion dollars in sales every year to down about twelve before they went bankrupt they're not much of a factor anymore and they're really not a factor in toys to speak out\nThere just a more of the symptom right there there what's happening out there they're not getting traffic their business when they didn't keep up with the times and they're just showing you what happens to retailers short part of the current movement to on line and everything else that has to happen\nThat's kinda where toys are us was they had become a bit of a dinosaur and the business and they were competing with people who were very very aggressive on price and who own fourth quarter and if you can on fourth quarter inch toys you can't oh toys\nI'm In the uh has pro cuts they're talking about laying off workers they employ fifty four hundred people worldwide as of twenty Seventeen their annual report\nAnd they could lose anywhere from fifty to five hundred workers or what is their situation I mean why are they are feeling the pinch like this\nWell there is a healthy one actually all they're doing here is trying to control the expense structure but they're the winter in the business they're the biggest they've got the movie's they've got the hottest toys so that that's not really the issue the issue is that businesses just become dramatically more competitive as it moves into these very\nAggressive companies that are hard to deal with when you sell them toys and so they're getting ready for the fact that it will be harder to get\nTo profitability out but there are very strong company I expect like I said one day you'll see them and Mattel merge and has where it will be the winner when that happens but either way has got to a growing business and the whole point of this by the way is still growing\nDespite toys are us being gone it's not the business is not growing it's just that it's much harder to make a dollar in it than it used to be\nJammed what am I here I I thought maybe like a week or two ago I saw somebody was trying to bring back the toys R Us brand or bring back the giraffe will do you know what that was all about\nYeah that happens with every bankruptcy somebody wants to buy the I. P. or you know the brands and do something with it so they want to use it on line or they may have a few stores and yes that goes on with each of them but it's never going to be a serious player again in the toy business it's not going to\nMatter it may be a business you may be able to buy stuff there if you want to but it's not going to be one of the big players ever again\nYeah Newsweek Magazine is still technically in business for the Newsweek dot com it's a business a jam thank you so much really appreciate you coming on and talk about it a Gen ... or CNBC retail analyst and the c._e._o. of genuine worldwide\nA eight hundred to two came to see if you want to join us ladies and gentlemen this Sunday aids walk LA will be out doing the annual walk if you want to come out there and walk with us it's a great cause you can also make a contribution go to ... dot com\nThat is a great event\nAnd uh the k._b._c. boosts will be at the halfway point and we can meet up there or after the uh\nUh the opening a gun and we all start off from downtown LA on Sunday Morning we'll meet you at the k._b._c. booth and we'll walk to the final distance together it'll be a lot of fun so that this Sunday the twenty first and how about this as a little a\nReward for being with us in the early hours exactly one hour from now at seven eight team color five will get a pair of taking the foreigner double vision then and now the original members including ... joined Mick Jones and the current lineup and to complete sense celebrating the fortieth anniversary of double vision as a Microsoft Theater on November ninth\nTickets on sale now furnished by golden voiced so go get them tickets and get some more great tickets wearing what stage coach coming up and rod Stewart later on in the show so hang in there\nAll right ladies and gentlemen the latest on the Saudis showdown\nIt does look like the president to slowly\nOr coming to the conclusion that yeah apparently the show he's dead\nAnd it's likely that the Saudis killed them now how far we go with uh the finger of blame remains to be seen the real indication wasn't that Mike Pompeo the secretary of state came back and said well the Saudis need a couple more days to come up to ... that they can lay on as\nThe real indication was that Steve lunch and the treasury secretary canceled\nHis trip to Riyadh Saudi Arabia for the upcoming uh Davos in the desert conference which is\nSomething that the Saudi royal family particularly the crown prince it was really his doing in and was in some ways it coming out party for Saudi Arabia and this event\nWas really remember a few months back maybe half a year ago\nWe got this news that the Saudis refined and letting women drive car yes yes all of that was in preparation for dollars in the day is uh bringing down the western world people and they were starting say alleged around the periphery let loose and let's get a little Lucy ... around the prayer for you to take some of the heat off of us and that's why the\nOr alleged murder any way of a ...\nIs such a catastrophe for Saudi Arabia yeah all that he are all over the world do or the the ... hanging out with Tim Cook of apple ... it's all gone south in fact they employed to a high very high profile Washington DC based a PR firms\nAt a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a month now both of the PR firms drop Saudi Arabia as a client yeah\nYou don't need your money well bloody dirty Monday ... well they were\nThere is one qualifier and they're so ... like Rachel McKinnon is a a transgender woman\nA and Rachel used to be Richard yeah and you know ... ... of the Richard got rid of the Richard a\nUses a different bicycle seat but the bottom line is won the women's bicycle race and here's the deal you know a week uh I I have I have friends and acquaintances who are transgender and have no problem with that and that's not a frivolous\nA capricious thing like you wake up one day and said yeah and I need this body part a\nShow I recognize that but we've got to come to terms with the inherent unfairness\nThat having somebody was born male and allowing that person to compete in ... in women's yes sporting event and they did logically it for on the air to the women it's unfair to the women who were born women yeah and I identify as women\nSo we got to come this this is nuts it's a six thirty\nOne big or not whether that was in Sweden\nThank you very much Doug morning everyone a man will spend the rest of his life in prison for killing a police officer and injuring his partner after crashing into an LAPD cruiser\nTwenty five year old mine or Burrell a learned just by Thursday for murdering officer or a bird oh Sanchez\nWhy\nHe was convicted of second degree murder an vehicular manslaughter an August prosecutors say he intentionally rammed Sanchez his patrol car with his SUV and twenty fourteen to try to stop the officers who are pursuing a Camaro being driven by one of her relatives friends I'm ... ...

Ronald Reagan's first term\nSix in ten registered voters said that Donald Trump is a factor now that could be one way or the other either to support or it adds\nTo hate on them yeah but the bottom line is because we always say and it's the reason we always say it is that it's borne out by history that the mid term elections are\nGenerally go against the party in power pendulum swings back the other way there have been\nA exceptions to that a classic example was a FDR in Nineteen thirty four\nOr even remember FDR was elected in thirty two and a vote for him and mental and no actually I didn't I Wish I Wish I went with Hoover I'm thirty two but ha ha it in thirty six I was down with FDR a by by k-mart out a by forty four I I was a window Wilkie guy\nBut who was really if you think about it [laughter] I'm Still a window located uh uh anyway the point is a FDR just had a massive victory in the mid term elections in thirty for\nA and actually had a big wipe out a few years later when he tried to pack the Supreme Court the country said that's overreach and they took Congress away I mean they they just they they lower you wanted to add more see yeah\nAh but in this particular case\nA presidents tend to say if they lose the house and they lose a lot of seats in the midterms is a well I wasn't on the ballot and if they win seats\nAnd those rare occasion I because of their and CIA or on the ballot\nIn a truck but every one of his rallies saying we'll go in there and vote like you're voting for me\nRight and that's the way he should campaign to his supporters of course but he's also said if the Republicans lose the senator lose the house it's not my phone out man you can't have\nBoth yet oh can you can yes you can uh Donald Trump can have both in fact most presidents try to have it both ways if the economy as good as they did it if the economy stinks it's someone else's fault six fifty for talk radio seven Ninety KBC\nThe little things like finding twenty bucks for the last\n\n... last shot on line for all the new style than that\nAround the dot com of course the dot com today for incredible\nI knew with my parents my son is that is\nEven more choices checkout today's deals on line for daily coupons enough\nEveryday states dot com little things mean everything off I couldn't apply\n[noise]\nLooking to save money on Medicare part D well Walgreen says I preferred network pharmacy for many plans including United healthcare which means lower ... for you to gather Walgreens and United healthcare makes saving on Medicare part D quick and easy\nTo bring your prescriptions to your nearest Walgreen pharmacy and start saving today [noise]\nWalgreens trusted some things you know one [noise]\nTaxpayer advocates across California oppose crops ten John Paul is president of the Howard sharp as taxpayers association\nPrompt and could create more than five hundred rental boards role of on the look of your friends and allow them to impose and government fees on all house lost control how much homeowners can charge to rent out their own home or even a single room\nRobert ... from California taxpayers association\nCorruption cost state and local governments hundreds of millions of dollars if is flawed plan gets challenging core prompting for taxpayers on the hook to defend to protect your wallet vote no on problems and\nCheck the facts that probably ... dot com\nPaid for by knowing prompt tend to flood initiative that will make the housing crisis worse coalition of housing advocates renters large and small businesses taxpayer groups and veterans committee major funding from Blackstone poverty partners al ... and that whole thing is I Love the blacks don't real estate partner six to eight or ... and their holdings\nSurfaces seizing equal housing lender seven sixty four none of the short supply will qualify for Trump's\nHomeowners do you need cash right now called a casual refinance I buy at eight hundred Seventy one eight to nine ... unique cash to consolidate high interest credit card or pre college tuition no problem\n...

I was ... will have that\nThey have that I think they have that guilty feeling and also they don't want they don't want their names and information spread\nAround the news and that sort of thing and so a lot of concern ... absolutely they don't want to come forward so uh so\nI think that that's one of the\nReasons that explains why I'm a lot of women have come forward but but some have certainly after this uh um you know after the after the press conference that we had a we started getting calls and you know we've had we've had a hundred or so calls now and everything are we at the end of those and investigating them and\nAnd uh and they're not all they're not all calls from uh from from victims necessarily but their\nTips and leads and are people who think they might be victims and we've been looking into that and now you know so we had five ... five new um good cases that we um that that we've ... there were prosecuting and and so that was the latest uh\nThat was the biggest thing that we had was the addition of those are those by counts plus\nA we also decided to looking at it and uh you know considering doing some research into how this happened that ah that's not the intoxication gives rise not just to uh on consented to sex but\nOn consented to moving of the of the party from one place to another and so ah so this was a kidnapping as well as a as a rape\nWe're talking with Orange County a dish attorney Tony ... as\nA Todd Spencer was with his yesterday and he or she made the allegation that this case took a took place in twenty sixteen and charges weren't brought until twenty Eighteen and that this represented a failure on your part how do you respond to that\n[noise] [noise] well ... we learned that there was such a case in a\nUh the towards the end of April twenty Seventeen and once the once our office Florida that I'm a big or we had a an attorney and investigator or start working on it with the Newport Beach police to uh to bring up a word and I\nI tell you how it works they worked diligently on this to a a check to brand forward wound up in uh January of twenty Eighteen uh doing uh\nA search warrant that search warrant\n[noise] um [noise] and just developed a huge amount of material that I had to be a I'd have to be a\nAnalyze and ... and you know ... that an analyze there had to be followed search warrants so it was a great deal it was a great deal of work and when we got the case when we finally got the case for a for a a\nR review from the Newport Beach police that was September sex\nAnd we found the case of five or six days later on September eleventh and we didn't you know we we worked a as quickly as we could\nTo to bring the case may rest on the on the next day that is well so um I I tell you the truth I think we've been working pretty well and I look back to see what a you know what are people who have been doing and\nAnd uh they they've been working diligently I mean we had we've had a like a a good attorney solemn investigator\nWorking on this case working with Newport and are trying to get this they analyzed so we could bring it forward\nUm the a release of this field a war or the sealed ... uh information which uh you have criticized Todd Spencer for now originally as I understand it this ... warrant was was not sealed originally and then was sealed subsequently is that correct\n[noise] it it ... it hasn't been sealed until uh until it was um\nUh brought to court to to um to the judge in the ... and he ordered it sealed in September\nOf ah twenty eight team so and they were they were two dates on September the eleventh when it was ordered sealed in September the Eighteenth when it was ordered a sealed again and\nAh [noise] it was very troubling I'm at the supervisor Spitzer's officer the court is an attorney he was in court a during a discussion of the\nUh the fact that these documents were sealed and then and then uh not long after that he was a outside a telling reporters that\nA while these documents were had been sealed by the court but I'm back to receive them before they were sealed so uh he was a handing out a pre prepared pre prepared copies or to the to the press so it's a it's a very um\n[noise] a very destructive to the case cows to the victims I mean this is a it was\nTo be honest with you it's stunning that are um that ah that I'm an attorney would do such a thing that he was doing it to a to make a point the point that he's trying to make about or that he thinks the timing of the case was bad and that sort of thing but uh basically he's just trying to build up is\nUm an argument for a for his candidate for district attorney so um it's it's just unfortunate that uh that he's done that and\nAnd I mean it's discouraging to victims of a ... shortly after that we started getting calls from\nFrom the victims in the case to we wound up their uh their private information has been revealed or or you know what happened here in the ... the ones that we've gotten a call from so far have been\nA ones that were not covered\nBy the by the search warrant but you know it's it's not just it's not just cows to them is also a discouraging to\nNew victims who might want to come forward and you know have the fear that this is going to be spread all over the news that their information might might be handed out to two reporters so ah so

created this opt out system which means that when you go to the DMV to get drunk drivers license you're automatically registered to vote unless you specifically opt out of being registered\nAnd if you don't select a a party preference you are automatically registered as a decline to state or no preference in other words an independent voter which is fine\nBut the question that people had from the beginning as well what about all the people we're we give a million drivers licenses the people who are in the country illegally and we were assured that that don't worry about that we've gotten

process to implement the legislation could take up to a year\nOr longer well\nIt's got to be done this is a you know in our attempt to get people to the polls ... first of all I wrote a column about it\nSo we could go uh we are confronting and trying to address\nVoter apathy from the wrong direction in my opinion the reason that voter apathy is so high is because people don't know how the system works we stopped teaching civics we stopped teaching\nA how bills become a law we outsourced it to to uh jak Sheldon to sing or I'm just a bill and as a result\nYou don't play a game if you don't know the rules if you don't understand the rules you're just not interested in it it doesn't apply to you have and we've done that for a very long time now there's other reasons too there's voter for tea constant elections the constant political ... turns people off\nOf some people don't want to register to vote because they're they'll get jury duty there's all kinds of reasons why people don't vote but you have to factor in as a major component that\nIs that if you don't understand the process if you don't understand the system and how what the three branches of government are and what they do and the federal system in state ... states you know law versus a federal law cetera\nYou're ... it's just it's just like the adult voices in the Charlie Brown cartoon you just walk out and why ...\nWon't won't won't won't walk and you move past it and millions of people do that\nSo what we do instead is we keep trying to say well if we make it easier for people to register if we make it easier for people to vote ... that'll get more participation there's no evidence of that what it does is it opens up more opportunities for voter fraud\nAnd that's a problem now with that said\nYou'll see a thousand stories of troll a social media about the evil Republicans trying to suppress minority voters by purging voter rolls all around the country I Wonder why no maybe that is the goal in Georgia and other places but\nIt is just as important to safeguard the integrity of the vote as it is to get people to register to vote in other words it's one thing to have people vote but it's another thing to have people who are ineligible to vote vote and we are opening up\nA thousand ways that the system can be jobs because you know these mail in ballots they used to be absentee ballots for a legitimate reason to vote when you weren't available instead fresh just balance ... rocks as well you guys grabbing packages off your front doorstep and go grab the ballots\nTo ... year one\nAnd you know in Texas there's a big controversy right now that uh the uh ballots were sent out in democratic precincts with the uh\nWith the uh preach it was pre checked for non citizens Texas Democratic party under investigation are being accused of sending a voter registration applications to non citizens with a citizen ship box already checked\nSo you know ... you know there's this huge massive voter fraud that way a person who's in the country are either as an illegal immigrant or is a legal immigrant but you're not allowed to vote can honestly say I didn't commit perjury I didn't check the box that says that I'm eligible to vote\nBut if you send it back and it was already checked when you got it\nSo somebody did the perjury for you\nSo you this is the cat and mouse game that goes on\nSo but we do have to find that sweet spot in the middle where we make it we make the election process as free and easy as possible for people who are eligible to vote and want to but we also have to safeguard the vote is honest and to me personally\nI don't think it's asking too much to show photo ID when you go to vote I think it's preposterous that in this day and age of a stolen IDs et cetera et cetera that you have to show a picture ID to get into Costco but you don't have to to cast a ballot you have to show\nOf a picture ID to get into the election headquarters in counties a county governments all over the place tried going past they all got metal detectors all got security try to get into one of these buildings yeah you all have to show some kind of idea to get in the building but you don't have to show an idea to cast a ballot it's crazy\nAnd you're off two birds with one stone open bar and all voting registering places you have to show your ID to get a drink and you can\nWell that's how elections used to be done when the George Washington ran for the house the bridges in Virginia before America was America but when we were still a colony or the first thing you
