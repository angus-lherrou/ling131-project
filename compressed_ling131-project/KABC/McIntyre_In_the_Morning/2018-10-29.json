to be with you\nOr Jerry the are obviously were piecing together both a Robert Bowers demented life and the wonderful people who were congregants of the tree of life congregation which is kind of the center of Jewish life or in the ... neighborhood of Pittsburgh\nAnd uh you know we've seen this many many times before one of the things\nThat is a I guess I don't know I I don't know how to say this without it sounding wrong which shocking about this is that with the history of anti Semitism this is in fact the single worst uh attack\nOn a Jewish community in the history the United states that's ... and it's happening in our time not in some ancient bygone time\nIt is astonishing and I think some people probably many people were taken aback\nWhen they heard that indeed it was the worst um it it is it is astonishing in this day and age especially given all the security preparations that have taken place in light of other shootings around the country and around the world\nNow are of course the controversy in the aftermath is that President Trump said they should have been armed guards there are many many\nA Jewish congregations and de de centers a childcare centers youth centers that are in fact a protected by armed guards but as we point out this guy shot to a police officers who were trained with the Kevlar vest so you know this was a man who is intent on murder\nThey beat the armed guard um probably would not have made that much of a difference um you know the Pittsburgh mayor disagreed with the president's comments saying that's not the way to protect the against irrational behavior\nBut certainly synagogues and for that matter churches and mosques will no doubt review their security preparations and some will decide on major changes\nUh in the wake of this shooting\nAt all we've had we've had it here in the San Fernando valley wouldn't different for oh shut up the Jewish center many years ago\nYeah our our ... our oldest son when he was young went to a Jewish day care and they had an armed guard then so that was twenty five years ago so it's not unprecedented it just that it's a silly controversy because that's\nThat wasn't you know the the president's\nSpoke for twenty minutes on on anti Semitism and uh the hatred of Jews and the violence and all of these things and for some reason we've latched onto his consistent position which you can agree or disagree with many millions of people have an opinion on whether or not there should be armed guards\nOr in places like this in the house of worship the tragedies that we even have to have that conversation\nUh unfortunately you do\nThat very true and I mean there's a there's a a synagogue outside Washington DC that I drive past on a fairly regular basis and there is a local police car there every time I drive by whether there's someone in it I'm not sure but that at least\nIt is a deterrent and uh you know one quick one thing police here are are trying to figure out\nIs does Robert Bowers case the synagogue but they're they're trying to find\nSurveillance video to see if perhaps he had you know check it out a a days earlier ads or whether this was purely random or perhaps

seems like a toxic mix\nWell this Robert Bauer his character or his gripe with President Trump apparently was that he didn't hate the Jews uh this was his complaint that because of Jared Kushner and the fact that von ... daughter converted to Judaism uh that ... and moving the ... the U.S consulate ah\nFrom ah Tel Aviv to Jerusalem he just feel that the President Trump was to down with the Jews are for his taste but a lot of these guys I guess they ended up on this gab website because they had been kicked off of Twitter and Facebook and you know the Graham and all the sort of legitimate ones\nYeah this was the this was the move was according to gab this was the freedom of speech element that you wouldn't find on Twitter and Facebook because as we see on ... on Twitter and Facebook now you've got the the CEOs and the and the the ownership of those organizations say listen we can't have this kind of hate speak on\nOur social media network we can't have this we're trying to curb that they're throwing people out there also throwing pots off a Russian so they're posting all kinds of stories that they're they're concerned about that element of it\nThat's not the case with Gavin fact they were using that form it that formation of listen let's create a world where media isn't interesting upon our free speech that on some level no one is filtering what we can and can't say or they're blocking us art\nOr dropping words are putting some sort of an expletive with a dog and the dash let's just have the ability to have free speech\nAnd clearly they were having that free speech but you can see now at some point it's come back and I think you're going to start to see officials investigators I mean listen for the rooms I went through on that Fifteen minutes I was looking on Saturday if I was just in an intelligence officer somebody in the FBI that that I have to investigate somebody based upon the hate\nThere was about forty to fifty people that I could have been investigating right now that look like they were not only filled with hatred but we're ready to act\nOn that hatred alone and that would make very busy the FBI or any other investigative organization that would have to search these guys out and try to figure out who a legitimate threat was\nShe we know if the government was looking at this site it all prior because we know that ISIS were they always talking like what's happened we know that they're always being surveilled do we know if the government was looking at this at this at\nAll they were they knew about it at least to a certain extent but this guy never popped\nUp on the radar there was nothing else outside of this guy that would make him a pop up and say well he's got violent street Grammy had Twenty one register and his name and and carried out the mask or with an A R Fifteen style rifle and three hand guns but all of that combined was not enough to make anybody concerned about this and again like I\nSaid if you were just in the thirty forty people was looking at there\nThere was a lot of hatred and a lot of anger a lot of vitriol what seemed to be people really ready to act on that on some level and so I don't know if you look at that here's one out of those forty who actually took\nAction you can legitimately say any of those what on some level so there's got to be this line this delineation between who is just talking and who's a threat to actually\nLast year that's always been the problem of making and of course the gap people said we're a free speech a platform and give people the widest latitude whereas uh say are the guy down in Florida\nI I strongly suspect that the FBI started looking for him almost immediately because of his previous track record the multiple arrest and the fact that he had threatened or explosives or or have they made a bomb thrower has the power company\nYeah he had a huge record going back to Nineteen Ninety four were allegedly he there was a domestic violence complaint against him that was filed by his grandmother that was later on dropped but there was some of us on some level between he and his grandmother she eventually thought\nWell I can help them out I can help I can make him better we can get them to help that he's looking for then you fast forward it two thousand for bomb threat then he was arrested in twenty and this guy had a very long wrap sheet and what that came the ability for ah\nFor authorities to trace a fingerprint found on on the low of a bomb that was male to Maxine Waters and bring it back to him\nThat also find DNA matching a sample taken during one of his previous arrests and then match\nThat to to other bombs that were sent out to these prominent politicians so his was a little bit easier to follow because of his arrest record as opposed to this guy in Pittsburgh that they just found out about\nWell this is always the most difficult one to track the guy that doesn't have the criminal record that lays low that isn't because there's millions and millions and millions and millions of website I I Can't ... I Believe how many times I find myself a quoting this\nBut I'm a ... you know it's like looking for a needle in a stack of needles not you know and that's the problem because there's so much hate speech floating around on the inner Web\nThat ... there's no shortage of leads the problem is ... ... the overwhelming majority of it is just that it's just people running their mouths they're not going to act on it but every once in a while you have this guy show up a guy like this show up and now it's a national uh cause a lab\nA Michael thank you so much appreciate you coming on with us from NBC News correspondent Michael by our reporting\nA eight hundred to two two K.

California [noise]\nOf a large native born Californians or vote with their feet now this is not unprecedented a there's a lot of parts of the country expensive places to live with the weather is bad New England and New Jersey Connecticut\nNew York Massachusetts also are often hemorrhage a population when people get into that red zone for retirement years they started looking south they lived through the Carolinas\nOr the mid Atlantic states maybe in Maryland along the eastern shore or Florida some warm weather yeah they don't have to shovel the weather and\nA bunch of ... here in many cases they they they outright say that they're leaving because it's too expensive let's talk about this with real estate expert and host of his own show on TALK radio one dot com Stevens fear Steven how are ya\nI Am well good morning Doug ... and\n... back thanks for being with us so this is a big red fish in a study and they got a big chart about the out source or the out migration a specifically from Denver San Francisco and Los Angeles I was surprised by Denver I thought that was one of the places everybody was going to well they\nDid and that's exactly why they're leaving now because it drove the prices up it's all supply and demand you had in the Nineteen\nEighties and nineties a tremendous act so there's going to Denver because housing was that expensive living was affordable [noise] of course when an areas successful success leads to becoming popular\nLots of jobs lots of opportunity and of course that drives prices up and construction although it's been strong in Denver hasn't been able to keep up with the demand creating a shortage creating even higher prices\nWould seem to me that's a solvable problem I mean there's no shortage of open space around Denver I mean that's the problem here were hemmed in\nIt's a political problem of course here\nWere him then we can build up but there is such tremendous resistance what you see is the behavior of apartment owners\nDictates the behavior of apartment developers so\nBack two years ago in Los Angeles in the greater Los Angeles area\nThere were any apartment that came up for sale and when I say apartment I mean anything from two units the five hundred units\nIt would be snapped up immediately we as it would sell above list price in multiple offers sometimes not even coming to market and you couldn't find something to buy now realtors are calling\nOr sending me phone calls and emails four or five times a day saying we got property for sale and this\nSuggests that fewer apartment developers will want to develop here because of the regulations and the cost and\nYet people want to get out of the apartment market some of that is driven by the hangover of proposition ten which if it passes is probably going to create even less development even less housing and in California\nFourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big blue dot com remember big lose IQ

know over thirty thirty one years now\nA ladies and gentlemen or so the yes on six campaign and we've spoken to the many times about this in this complaint to something we've discussed and it's completely legitimate the\nA state of California are deliberately uh messed with the title on the ballot measure that would repeal Jerry Brown's crooked gas tax Andy\nEliminate funding for bridges and roads bill\nEliminate revenue certain revenues you know they made it sound like of course uh that uh this is just a monster is I'm surprised they didn't call it let's put your children's lives at risk press was saying\nIn the propaganda ads they exactly\nAnd so the Ah yes on six gas tax repeal campaign is going to announce a legal action as they seek a last minute remedy to the false and misleading ballot title that was given by state politicians and ah they're gonna be up in uh Sacramento\nOr to make this announcement this morning at ten thirty and uh let me ask you first of all I see no way the ballots have been printed and mailed out people have already voted\nSo ... it's a little uh late in the game for this and the fact that they're filing this lawsuit tells me they think they're going to loews yeah because a\nNumber we talked about pulling last week I talked about on the news I think it was like right neck and neck but they were only had to live in fact that they're that\nThey're filing this lawsuit now this lawsuit by the way it should have been filed but it's ... months ago yes a great I mean before the ballots were print yeah filing it now is a complete waste of\nTime to do all that double speak and make it sound like it's something completely different than what it is well\nI've been arguing for Twenty years that they are there shouldn't be titles on ballot Maine can just be the proper number and then you have to read it and and by the way they're still you're going to have to fight your way through who writes the language\nBut filing a lawsuit a you know a week our you know for election day when you know they have now but they already voted yeah is that only pointless and it just to me raised a red flag that they think they're going to lose\nIt's unfair game there you know pretty much now in a fight where people think well if you hate roads and bridges vote yes on probably they knew that\nThat was that was the fight from the beginning that was always going to be under fire from the beginning and they knew as soon as the secretary of state put this title out that that they should have gotten a court order to stop it right then before the ballots were printed and mailed out and cast\nSent they are texting campaign out doing for people I got a text randomly the heads up brandy politicians gave ...\nIn title a yes vote on

evil Jews from getting migrants into this country\nAnd uh and the an irony whereas the guy down in Florida was mailing the bombs out a door Donald Trump this guy hated Donald Trump and hated Donald Trump because he was too easy on the Jews\nHe did down from like the Jews too much Jared Kushner his son in law's Jewish and his daughter converted to Judaism any move the U.S embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nMake cetera so uh\nBut he also bought into Trump's ... theory that there's terrorists middlemen with the caravan\nWell you know ah I I'm a\nMaybe this makes me sound like a lunatic but I'm Sorry I just have to say there's no way of knowing who's in the care of and never has been caught forty Thousand Oaks TMZ at the border\nWhich has other than Mexicans including ... ... people from Libya so there is no way of knowing who's in when you allow a hundreds of thousands of people a year to come across or enter the country either through caravans through the southern border or through the airports are now\nIs that the principal reason why the borders should be secured no but it you can't say it's not a ... it's not possible because we caught forty thousand people coming across or not from Mexico or Central America\nSo that when it had a category for it\nWhen they catch people go TMI rather than actually the whole that whole problem is a big number but it's not the ... it's not the single reason that we need to take the reason we need to protect the border is because we're a sovereign nation we have a right to protect our own damn\nForeigner why is this even a controversy but we digress the point is is that this guy is a hater and a ... and he uh committed a horrific act of crime against people again\nWhen you go into somebody's house of worship and started shooting people love whether it's Dylann Roof for its hero wherever it is\nI mean there's not even any point in trying to diagnose the problem it's so obvious what the problem is the question is what culpability\nDoes society on the ... I mean obviously Robert Bowers is responsible for this the lunatic bomber down in Florida say oc is responsible for the terror he instilled Dylann Roof was responsible for his crimes the guy who was shot up\nThe pulse nightclub in Orlando was responsible for his crimes the criminal is always responsible for\nThe parents offering that they call him but\nIt is my belief and I'm certainly not alone in is that when you get into these crimes that have a a a a political slash racial component to it then there there\nAre other contributing factors that can lead to these crimes and that is to use the fancy term ... guys there's the uh what's out in the time in which these crimes are committed\nA you know as I mentioned in my column last Sunday when pressed in Brooks of South Carolina United States congressman or walked over to the Senate and nearly killed the United states senator whether it's walking stick it was in the context of the debate over slavery\nIt was a ... that precedent Brooks allowed the passion of the moment to make them a crazy person\nWhere he went and nearly beach Senator Charles Sumner to death temporary insanity well now he's totally responsible for it by the way paid no price for it whatsoever the he got hundreds of walking sticks send to them as a tribute because he smashed the ... coming right yeah they had a dinner thrown in his honor when he went back to the Carolinas\nSo you know the thing is is that people can feed off of the negative energy\nAnd they look at it as he the justification or they perceive that they will be heroes that's what Jack Ruby did when he killed Lee Harvey Oswald he thought he was going to be a hero I kill the bastard a kill JFK\nAnd his guys thought he was a heroin is racist social network thing I got to stop these guys when\nYou're talking to the people who think like you that the right field way it's like oh yeah everybody supporting well that's exactly the problem on the reinforcement yeah and when you move on in age and I keep going back to this because I think it's the most important thing in our age\nIn our time is that it's the confluence of religion and politics once you identify the other side as evil and with the events of the Christian right\nHas been doing this for forty years basically it's grafting Jesus wants you to vote a certain way and those other people are the anti Christ they are against God's law et cetera et cetera et cetera\nThe left has created its own secular form of faith and it's really to me you saw most clearly when it comes to environmental or environmentalist\nThe radicals not somebody who wants to clean water for God's sakes we should all want that clean air et cetera\nBut when you start to see people that any compromise with industry is not acceptable well you've elevated it to a ... a matter of faith moral high ground and once once it becomes that than there is no compromise possible then and to compromise is to be a traitor\nAnd you wind up with sick people interpreting that as anything I can do to stop this is acceptable right and and inevitably and a nation that trend is thirty million people in a lot of guns you can end up with some lunatic act upon it because it's easy to get weapons\nAnd if you're a lunatic\nThen it's easy to you know a feed off of the negative energy and we're off to them and what's that guy's set on that ... was like well I'm going out and\nDo we do when you do a background check if they look at your social media even obscure websites like gab ... mentioned\nIt the problem is it's like looking for a needle in a stack of needles because a lot of people now fall fall on social media and they're never going to act on it so you can find his hair and release everybody and we want to live in a country where your police everybody\nI'm All right we're talking about ... and just a second Bobby Valentine Dodgers eliminated a in five against the red Sox last night's game a five\nOr want to join us in a special

attach a ... this kind of hateful animosity towards the Jewish people uh I ... it just lost on me but it still here and this in fact was the worst attack on Jews in the history of America which is stunning to think we're in twenty Eighteen and that happens now\nI agree it's it's a hard to fathom because by most of the metrics that we measure anti Semitism\nUntil the last couple of years hate crimes were down polling showed greater except that in fact one of the loop holes of or actually conducted several times over the past decade and a half of shown that the Jews are the most of the

that's exactly right I I think that the the guilt and culpability is always on the uh ... is always on the head of the perpetrator but these things happen within his eye guys within the within the culture and the times in which they take place\nAnd while I Believe that the president has contributed mightily I think he uses bully pulpit to bully rather than to for a higher purpose but one of the ironies here\nIs that this guy Bowers hated Donald Trump because Donald Trump lights the Jews because Donald Trump move the capital of the move the U.S embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has a son in
