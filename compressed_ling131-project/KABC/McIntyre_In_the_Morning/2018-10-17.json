restrict gets ... in any\nBut actually something I was watching the game was it like forty nine or something\nThey trying to ... teams there was some ridiculous yeah uh some ridiculous amount of strike outs in the game let's face it but there were at one point I Know it it it Seventeen Dodgers are struck out fourteen the night before and this is the problem is whether or not scoring because\nAnd you got to give all due credit to Milwaukee Milwaukee scouts\nHave isolated the way to pitch to the Dodgers and the and the brewer pictures have been able to execute it yeah uh and the Dodgers are upper ... a walk home run team which means is big holes in swings and they're finding the halls and they hit their spots\nBut meanwhile it's not exactly like Milwaukee's beaten up on the Dodgers either right because the Dodger bullpen starting pitching in both and it was fantastic yesterday just sensational\nAnd thank God we only have Thirteen mimics food we're about out of and we were out of gas or you're going to say I was going to be out there forever he'd still be out and you know\nWhen a lot and I'm like oh no yeah hope he can hold it down and he did that all he did strike

because you'd like to go back on that charter to Milwaukee up three to ... and only have to win one at a two on the road instead of having to take both games from Milwaukee in Milwaukee but before we get to a today's game and the future\nUh last night's game was a doozy because you had two teams\nWho had lights out pitching that's easy to look at the two officers God they're just swinging and missing it ever than the Dodgers struck out Seventeen are more ... at least Seventeen jobs and a Milwaukee was a much better\nBut if you watch the game the pitching was sensational\nI mean it really was sensational nobody put anything in the middle of the plate everybody's hitting the corners and why was rich hills so mad that eats for steroid that box of candy while he was upset because he gave up to try and run\nA great I Know he did but that is competitive nature and he felt like you let the team down because they had a one nothing lead and the way this series has been going that may be all you get out on the wrong sad the Columbus guy goes and fixes that they send a bad boy\nAnd they go get some more ... there was no way he was going to clean that up\nNo ball players don't clean up the mess they make a that's what the public relations department is four and one of the messages are one of the messages that has to be cleaned up as many Machado mess will get into that and just a

injury data and messaging rates may apply it's for ... noon and three on seven knotty K ABC Show the night before\nIn game three the controversy quote unquote controversy was yes shall we baiting\nA Jeffers the Milwaukee picture a last night this story again was odd behavior for many Machado now many Machado is one of the great talent in all sports certainly in the sport or baseball he's one of the best young talents in the world nobody questions that\nBut he does have a a a a history of rather an sportsmen like behavior on the field that doubt this is last night we saw a doozy and this comes on the heels of an interview that he gave with the athlete magazine where he said I don't like to hustle\n[noise] because I'm not my cup of tea\nI'm not a hustle kind of guy I'm not the guy that's going to run it out to first base a and we see more and more of these prima Donna young players who play this way I don't understand why they choose to do this why there was where it as a badge of honor out a bench them if he said that\nUh but they never do now and they're afraid need them because they know they say they need him and be there the ... you know the inmates are running the\nAsylum this one of the few guys but it's been getting hit this theory\nOr and then there's the issue of uh the to slide in game three into second base where many Machado knows the rules and he knows that in the era of review\nPlays which they slide at second base is automatically review of all if the other manager choose to do so he sides over the bag and reaches out with his raft crowded and rise to grab the leg of the second baseman which is clearly interference yeah attempted interference anyway and and on the second play\nUh [noise] they credit counselor manager of the brewers came out and said I Want it that looked at and immediately they not only called Machado Alford also cold hardy Bellingham route yeah\nAnd and I don't know what in the world that can be thinking there's eight thousand cameras on him well I don't think he cared he knows there's cameras on him he's just that guy and then last night\nUh inexplicably he decides because he's mad and he grounded out he's running to first base and he's thrown out at first but he has his front for his right foot on the bag his left foot he plants in the dirt and drags it\nNot across the bag but across the ankle of the brewers first baseman or ...\nMusic there's no way that could have just been I Know dental\nAbsolutely there in the world that would only dragged ... consciously deliberately did it yes I think he was mad that he was getting even being thrown out the guys but was a little high up on that I thought it'd be great I play first base my whole pathetic baseball career\nAnd there are times when you're trying to pick up the ball and your your mind right without looking trying to find the bag track words\nAnd sometimes your foot encroaches a little further on the back by the way it's all a danger to you because you're the one that's going to get at least by now say All right but the thing is his foot wasn't in the middle of the bag it was maybe on a third of the bag right but the runner\nAlways goes to the outside of the ... because they know they're trying to get away with what they're trying to be that they don't want to trip over it either so he went and did it deliberately\nAnd it was just ... yeah and if it was the regular season they would have been abroad and there was nearly a brawl even a post cleared the Ford obviously to have somebody thrown out and suspended so as a result uh it it it blew over but a merger the landing for the first lady's plane smoke reported in the cab yes\nMechanical problem it turn things around she landed safely\nOkay there you go yeah so that when you know they had amazing what you can see it on the ... anyway so that controversy aside or the Dodgers pitching we'll talk about ... Milwaukee's bullpen Milwaukee's bullpen Milwaukee's ... has been better hasn't it because uh look what they did they do\nAnd it was only Thirteen enemies we ran out of ...\nWell both teams were they were ... much the only body Craig council had left which Jefferson these fish in the last four I actually didn't want to use it\nExactly so a river that are put in ... we went to fourteen uh they\nDid well they actually throw him back on that out yeah ah\nSo I'm One of the\nConsequences of that game going into extra innings is that Kennedy Jansen pitched to innings last night and it can lead Jansen only did that once this entire season that was in Megan's Arizona ... so that could have a big effect on who gets to close out today's game but you know\nAnd they only went to Miami to play like to hear and what he\nSaw what happened ... here's the thing they're going to have to it's all hands on deck and this time of year you got to win the ones in front of you that's the only game that matters right\nNow the one in front of you figure out tomorrow tomorrow unfortunately for everybody involved tomorrow isn't about twelve hours at less than six hours seven hours\nSo uh it's an afternoon game Dodgers tied to to a ... by the way made the play of the post season and saved that series for the Dodgers by making a sensational catch I ought to leave I drive\nWhen I watch the replay he came from and how we might have it in ... I wasn't even on ... on it and then go and run and catch that portray he wasn't even on the screen and comes around me that talk everybody comes running out of ... or a big guy with amazing catch fire

this became a political issue when one of the papers came up with the very clever focus conscious FAU ex hunters\nPresident Trump miss that joke just started calling her Pocahontas and this became missing well Senator Warren who's obviously considering running for president twenty twenty released the results of one of those DNA tests\nThat apparently showed that up to anywhere from six to the tenth generation which would make her one one thousand twenty fourth part indigenous person and this has resulted in even more ... things like hashtags\nThe me sue or a sitting bull bleep\nAnd on and on and on and it goes but the bottom line is millions of Americans\nAre taking these DNA tests\nAnd what did they actually mean are there are lots of people who are finding out that they thought that their ethnicity was accent it turns out it was why I thought I was Chinese let's find out from somebody who actually knows professor at Tufts University an expert in genetics it's a pleasure to welcome to show\nA professor Sheldon ... thank you for being with us we appreciate it\nHigh or I should uh first of all say that I'm not a geneticist per se but I Do study or the implication of genetics on social and ethical issues and ah understand how they do these ancestry tests I'm also\nA written on genetics and privacy with respect to these to these tests so I can certainly the provide a lot of information\nUm but I Am not a a a geneticist\nFair enough we appreciate the clarification and and speaking of privacy we just saw a piece in the Los Angeles times this morning\nAh actually it's from the October twelfth edition but they came to our attention this morning Lee and noticed that it says so many people have had their DNA sequence that they ... they are putting other people's privacy in jeopardy I could you talk about that for a bit\nWell sure and I think the folks in California probably understand this because sometimes it can be useful to ... to the ... a forensic community to the criminal justice community\nSo ah you know you can show that people are relatives by a close by looking at their genetic information\nOr the ... because you know brothers and sisters fathers and sons\nWill share a great deal of of their uh genetics and their DNA will look very similar compared to to just a random person in the population\nSo I'm ... it started out this way you know when the police were they had a crime scene of a DNA from the crime scene and they didn't have a match on the uh FBI database called code is\nUm initially if they didn't have a match they didn't know what to do um they were looking for an exact match but then later on they had something called familial DNA searching where they would find somebody on the on the code is a database\nThat looked a little similar to the uh DNA at the crime scene [noise]\nWhat they would do then is to look at the family of the person who was on the database and use traditional methods which is a you know find an object that they left aside and check the DNA\nTo see if there was an exact match so you can see that there are ... a ... a family resemblance as in the DNA [noise] so if if you um get your DNA tested and you put it on line or put it on a website [noise]\nThing is titled on the ballot I Know they make it look like cut off funding for roads and bridges a\nPoison children die and uh be mean to small furry cute animals are in place some is leading it's it's just this is what we're up against we're up against it all ladies and gentlemen really are the system is stacked against you you look at

many times and he's been one of our go to guys\nHe surprised everybody but announcing that he was gonna be leaving the city council to go into the private sector to take a job with a big sports entertainment from\nOkay fine uh is that the first person to do that right but now we learn that the night before\nHe made this announcement he hosted a fundraiser at eight hundred dollars per person and this is for his office holder account\nNow off a soldier accounts or legal in the city of Los Angeles it's a fund that city politicians use to pay for food travel office supplies and other expenses including they\nCan make charitable contributions to different causes but what of course it allows them to do\nIs to live higher on the hog make a junket trips and pay for foreign travel and again when you make those charitable contributions to give a couple of thousand bucks here or there too you know the church that needs a new van or to the whatever you're buying of course affection you're buying supporting loyalty\nBut everybody does it so much in ... not out of line with an officer cap\nBut what is out of line is hosting a an eight hundred dollar per person fundraiser the night before you're going to announce that you're leaving the city council because if you're leaving the city council you don't have an office yeah why do you account anymore yeah now he\nSays that of course the events had been planned a well in advance of his decision to leave which I can understand that happened but the thing is el the night before I'm going to say I wouldn't go out on a limb here and say\nA week before you get a\nPretty good I knew that the eyes were being dotted the teaser being cross as you are preparing to exit from the city council and you certainly had time to notify the people who bought the eight hundred dollar tickets that I'm not going to be in the city council so if you would like to bow out of this I certainly understand\nAnd uh now he's offering to reimburse anybody who uh who asked for a their money back\nBut I'm not sure that I Need a ride piece of chickens worth eight hundred dollars like well first of all it's never wear the eight hundred dollars like what what what you're buying this is ... yeah that's what you're and you're buying a good neighbor of member of the city\nCounty right and this is what they all do this is how and this is what is happening at every level of government and it's why it's all disgusting and it turns apple off\n... and it really does and and you know ... you know the gas tax that Jillian junk to be out there in Pasadena and try to repeal that\n... you know you may want the gas tax maybe you think that that's a good thing but at least consider the way it was passed and whether you want to reward that system the way that was passed was legalized theft they took the public's money and they bought\nThe votes of the legislators who knew it was a bad bill for their constituents but they said look if you vote for this will make sure you get millions of dollars for some project in your district and that'll make you really popular\nI gave a bunch of money to a desk and I were in ...\nYeah I mean I'm Talking about a tremendous amount of money hundreds of millions of dollars cash because they know the billions will come back over time\nSo I mean it was it was it was legalized bribery and then a there's the way the a ballot measure gets titled\nOr on the ballot because the politicians who are in favor of the gas tax are the ones who get to make up the name and they literally put a name on the ballot measure for six if you just ready to union nothing else to say well this is madness this is gonna be a just a disaster for the state of California which is a reasonable people's lives at risk\nWell that's because they're demagogues and they this is a tax that's less than a barely a year old the world is not going to end if it's repeal maybe they could come back and do it legitimately

carrying a off advocating because our neighbors and our friends down in Venice have been fighting among the MTA plus short project which you think is a separate issue but you guys this is all connected I mean\nI Believe what we're talking acted I I Believe all of these schemes are connected to meet you is because\nThese ... involved in this uh we have\nAh people in elective office who are at war with the private vehicle they have a vision for what the city should look like and it looks like Manhattan with high density housing retail on the first or second floor a and mass transit a moving people about the problem is\nThat ... there's two problems one the mass transit doesn't exist in many cases in his decades away from existing into\nA how 'bout considering what the citizens interests and what they want the people actually live here what kind of a city did they want to have and the ideologues at city hall don't care and I'm kind of\nConvinced and this may just be my own uh nutty theory dimitrius\nBut I I I actually think\nThat when this jumped the shark on them and guys like you who are my bond and supporters turned on him because of this a terrible idea I think that now\nThey can't wait for all the businesses on Venice Boulevard to go out because you will be removed the people who remember what it was like before the road was narrowed and\nUh the businesses were put behind the eight ball once your own Don they can rent buildings out to people who except it with the bike lanes in front\nAnd they had no institutional memory of what it was like to do business in the old days and problem solve all the tribal makers will be gone\nYou're exactly right Doug I haven't seen that a long time the new people that are coming in there don't remember what it was like before and they'll just be happy to be on that stretch of the block because we've built that\nNeighborhood up in the last Fifteen Years you know I started the farmers' market twelve years ago there was nothing in that neighborhood before we came there there were three businesses to all three of us are going to wait time or music or some Tokyo who was right next door to me to open the same here or that we it open a move earlier this year\nAnd then I was like kind of the last of the Mohicans and I was like out of my pride and you know I was like I'm not going to I'm not going to go anywhere I'm going to stick to sing out but as smart businessman says you know what I'm losing money here and I'm barely being able to pay my employees before that I kept\nAnd one of them has been looking for

it has never create anything they have they're out of touch with with the real world and I think it's time to fight back so John Russo for probably moving those guys they knocked out of the ballpark you know they've got they've victory on their science he helped or six or seven other neighbors\nIncluding Pasadena teaming up with them given all the resources that they had gained over the years worked in our neighborhood getting our group up we have a new group that filed a lawsuit west LA neighbors dot org\nThey uh they got a sequel appeal because that's the name of the game the planners have contracted by the city\nThey know that these big changes here we're going to have a big impact but they find some way to keep this categorical exemption from secret and you don't really know about it until it's over and then you lose if they're thirty days the window to appeal and it's a slam dunk so\nThis last round of the ... caught this uh ... uh was\nBeing filed they barely qualified for the appeal they hired the lawyers at the famous people down in uh in Venice hired to fight back over there with their sequel appeal I hired the lawyers\nFrom play it All right that we're successful in getting that are that are wrote that reversed over there for the covers association were going after them I told you that big lawsuits are coming we're we're we may lose our businesses

there'd be a hit list plastic water bottles will be on the list eventually uh and and one by one they'll go after him\nI Would much prefer to see us make these choices when I was a kid we always had papers\nStraw that when I was in kindergarten through I don't know when whenever that stopped a and then we switched to plastic everything and the bottom line is is that the best thing we can do is to keep some of it out of the eco system I prefer if we did it voluntarily\nBut if we can't and errors demonstrable a ecological damage being done here then maybe we have to interdict I mean I don't know what to say wait adapted to the plastic bag thing I don't even think about it and no it's not that big a deal it's really not a ... you know and like I said we use plastic\nAnd as Jerry Seinfeld said what's the deal with stroke anyway what I came to the last four inches I mean you know [laughter] I mean I understand women like the straws because it doesn't mess up their lipstick\nUh but uh uh you know there's a utilitarian purpose for the buck for them it's easier for kids they don't spill everything all over the place but you know again the real problem comes back to slobs who throw this stuff out the car window\nAnd it ends or just leave it wherever they are and it ends up being a problem for the rest of us [noise]\nAll right after nearly Thirteen Years as the anchor mar vista revitalize downtown the Venice growing coffee shop is closing its stores for good\nOwner dimitrius maverick Calif told us this morning that the coffee shop is among at least twenty other businesses in the area to shutter over the past Seventeen months he blames it on the road died imposed by LA\nOn on on the and almost a mile long stretch of Venice Boulevard championed by city council member my bonding Carlin's were replaced in each direction with protected bike lanes local residents and merchants blame the controversial action for unsustainable drops in revenue\n[noise] well we had a very heated conversation not between dimitrius and myself Dmitri as a member of member McHale is\nWho owned the Venice grind a coffee shop which was there for Thirteen Years there was an anchor store on Venice Boulevard and to me the story is\nIn Seventeen months since this road diet nonsense started on Venice Boulevard and an eight tenths of a mile stretch Twenty one businesses a folded in the previous ten years to businesses fold\nWhat changed [laughter] the road did because of the same old took away\nA one lane are squashing traffic and making it\nMore difficult for people to pull over to the side in front of the store run in and all these ... this is a commuter street so a place like Venice cry and people are going to run and grab a coffee in a you know a muffin and then\nHop in the car and go to work or stopping the way home or whatever and if you don't you know and if you don't have easy access\nYour business is going to suffer look this city's about parking because that's the way we move about but the city is deliberately doing this consciously and I can't emphasize this enough\nThis isn't a an accidental byproduct this is the intent is to make it difficult to drive in a city where it's already difficult to drive\nAnd the other shoe dropping is that they completely reverse policies Thirty years ago\nDevelopers used to put up a fuss because the city would make them add parking to any development so that there was a place for the cars to either ... residents to park if it was an apartment building or a condo or\nA shopper parking if it was a strip mall or some kind of a shopping center now it's exactly the opposite they're making the developers tape parking away because they want\nTo make it difficult to drive and if you can't park some place you're not going there now it's like getting gas at a gas station you don't go look for the one on the left you pass the one on the left to find them on on the right so it's easier to get to and and how do you stop and the bottom line is\nYou know what's lost in this is this the function of local government because they have an agenda and I understand\nAnd I believe that in the big picture there right Los Angeles is going to get denser and it's going to get taller and we're going to have mass transit and I'm In favor of all of those things by an avid yet because it's inevitable\nBut the bottom line is the population is increasing and there's no place to go out anymore we can't keep building out into burn areas\nYou know and we can't keep asking people to come Seventy five miles each way to get to and from their jobs in the city\nPeople are gonna be commuting from needles\nResearch so hot so so you know I understand that we have to make physical changes the infrastructure but you've got all the measure him money build the damn transit system before you start taking away what is there now\nAnd the indifference and hostility towards the people whose lives you're racking is unconscionable it really is this is\nA it's just an arrogance of government that is just unconscionable and this is at the local level this isn't an idiot logical issue this isn't left right this is a Democrat Republican\nWho says absolute power this is one party rule and this is voter indifference those are the consequences of have a nine to twelve percent voter turnout and local elections because\nThey feel they're bullet proof that they can do whatever they want and it doesn't matter so Mitch Englander feels like I can announce my resignation from the LA city council to take a higher paying job in the private sector but the night before hosted in eight hundred dollar a plate fundraiser from my office account\nKnowing full well that he was leaving I mean yeah maybe\nUh the the the last ... eyes weren't dotted cheese wearing crossed until the next day but you've got a pretty good idea that you're doing the dance with the new employer when you're sending out the invitations or to an eight hundred dollar a plate fundraiser and he didn't tell any of the people\nUh in advance that you're going to be leaving the city council\nAnd the fact that you can go and fund raise for an office to count to pay for things as a whole separate issue [noise]\nForgot to defend yourself a was wondering why is he still talk the Anaheim Angels either way I'm not the only one who was wondering why he's still talk via\nCalifornia Angels the Anaheim Angels in Los Angeles I don't call them that that's ... that's the name of the team well maybe they will be the Los Angeles angels the Anaheim Angels have decided to opt out of their lease with the city of Anaheim for angel stadium\nThey at least that was going to go all the wait till twenty twenty eight and now they have the option of leaving after the twenty ninth team season this is most likely to renegotiate maybe get some stadium improvements angel stadium is before the oldest baseball stadium in the country but uh what if they lost\nWhat are we able to go out and we are and where are they going or in angel well they got to have a stadium to play and exactly I I I first of all I forgot I mean we always\nTalk about how Dodger Stadium is the third oldest ballpark in major leagues and you'd never know it looking at is beautiful\nUh listen when Disney or on the angels they remade as a big gay and they turned it into a gym of a ballpark the angels drawl well if we're and three million people and they're a it's a fun place to go see a game it doesn't look fifty\nYears old I was shocked to see that it was fifty years old I mean just totally forgot now I understand that everybody's got new ballparks and they want the luxury boxes and they want the neighborhood amenities and all that stuff\nAnd that's all this is this is just leverage is is what Disney was doing with the Anaheim and trying to leverage that luxury hotel I I don't know if the angels are going to have any more luck if Disney could muscle them I don't know how the angels are going to muscle them\nBut I can drive because they can say well we'll take our ball and go somewhere you\nCan say that all you want but the question is is there a better ballpark waiting for you someplace else I don't\nSee one in Southern California Mm I don't see another baseball stadium in Southern California waiting for them because the new stadium we're building over in Inglewood here for the charges and the rams into baseball now ... football at a football stadium yeah unless you want to get Wally Moon out of a a you know a out of the cemetery and I\nPut up a screen up and have moon shots again in a twelve foot left field uh anyway uh it's about money and I get it but the Disney deal was about money too and Disney had to surrender on that one so good luck angels

Glad everybody safe but his at all possible millennia looked at her Twitter solved the horse face stuff and decided to light a match to stay outside of the country [laughter]\nSo yeah we are playing problems I don't want to come home a man any way a lead is a general we had a conversation early this morning a with\nA dimitrius a ... who is the owner of the Venice grind coffee shop on Venice Boulevard in mar vista over there where the road was we did the show from there are many\nMonths ago when this story first became a big issue when the city of Los Angeles took away a lane on busy Venice Boulevard as part of the road diet\nAnd uh put in a bollards to create a a a bike lane\nAnd a lot of business owners were exceptionally upset as were a lot of people use that as a commuting road because it's a it's a obviously a busy street and for a lot of people to work around the clogged and perpetually a gym or you know highways freeway system\nA bunch of businesses are really complaining because their customers are having trouble accessing their stores\nWell the vet is grind has now closed\nThat is grind is the twenty first business to close in an eight tenths of a mile stretch of Venice Boulevard and Seventeen months in the previous ten years to businesses closed Seventeen months has claimed Twenty one businesses\nA and this is not what local government is supposed to do although I I actually believe\nThat once this issue became radioactive for my bone and then the LA city council\nOr that at this point the sooner all of these businesses go out the better because once they're gone anybody who signs a lease on the property to move in is moving in knowing that there is no a parking in front of their businesses that it's a bike lane in front of their businesses\nAnd therefore they don't have the institutional memory of what it was like before when it was better before the city made it worse\nBut who's who's going to move in there if even a coffee shop can't make it do well\nSomebody who knows you know you see a lot of these small businesses and some of them that you think well how in the world can uh be lounge stay in business and ... you know they ...\nThe day they found out that somehow they make it but the thing is is that ... it's just the psychological barrier that when you move in like\nYou know TV city is going to be on the auction

in\nAn hour to go have a deli on candidate for the United States Senate and a strong rain a former Dodger all stars going to be here to talk about game five this afternoon at Chavez Ravine so don't go away and now I'm On talk radio seven on occasion\n\nRemember that thing your wife and you couldn't live\nWith for a day you can\nAnd she doesn't even have to know about\nIt you're not shot at a grand is coming up in just seconds so even\nThe Orange County cumulus station\n\n\nYou could win one thousand dollars now just affects the national keywords designed by one nine that is the the id died fighting one nine now affects you back from your injury data and ... for food and somebody said have you seen\nReplace the ... ...\n... talk of the goal and you should look to let you watched\nAnd that the ball it's not going to go to our so I think that's either seem more one not they chew on days um you know if that might try to get your during the day\nWe're talking with Sean green a former ah all star of foreign Los Angeles Dodgers in a great career including a an epic forty nine home runs season Shaun the both of these teams are powered teams the Dodgers and the second most home runs in major league baseball only behind the Yankees and send a franchise record for power\nBut you haven't seen it a lot of it and last night man runs were hard to come by how does it happen and all of a sudden\nA two teams that can put the ball and play are having trouble even making contact\nYeah I think there's a few reasons the first is that when you're limited the run like coming budget that\nIt's ... ... where there were there cold today structure Ron you're used to you know they run a gay guys over ... that's a that's the other dogs those at the ballpark and then the other thing is in the ... it would\nTake a Milwaukee there's not just because it's so crucial it got to be able to do with the left early to slap you got to pitch in the third day I thought a lot\nMore chance it it it makes it harder it'll ones but you have these match ups\nOr does ah does a day robbers have a\nKennedy Jansen to use today he used them for two innings last night and he was very effective but he only pitched to winnings uh once this year and that was back in may against Arizona\nYeah yeah that's that's tough I mean that's the thing on Milwaukee's solidity relievers stressed out a little bit as well so you know I think at this time but I Would guess\nThat the nature of that on it already I guess they keep quiet on it it ... it down they probably don't want to say that has changed their strategy but also\nThe case in a crucial situation it's like you know what let's just go with ... ... even though you probably should have the day off to the gate gate five of adults yeah you've got to take a chance that I Would expect you to be available um but you know it's got their first choice it much other salad or they push it out to worry about it\nYeah the last thing either team wanted to see was a game that goes into the thirteenth ending a [laughter]\nBut what are you going to do I mean you've got to win the one that's in front of you in this time of year so it's really kind of all hands on deck and I didn't last night's game which is hugely important if the Dodgers down three one\nOr they would be in huge trouble and arguably it's really not much better today because you don't want to be down three to going back to the other guys ballpark a and having to win two on the road\nIs out there I always felt like I think you'll ... you'll say wherever to speak out at ... spirit of the closest living but I as I Do but uh I I think it's an advantage actually to eat to not feel as if you could win the Dodgers it warmed up to date on the road\nAnd you're ... you're supposed to put all of which you out of a sudden you get going back to the ... I'll take my chances split when Syria I'm On the road at a shit and that's really where the doctors are they lose their third trouble it's chopped off too so\nYeah yesterday was obvious must weigh like which is a lot to talk on\nUm ... not that I Want to drag you into the controversy over a man he was shot but I've been watching baseball from fifty years and ah I I you know I played for space or badly\nI'd like to point out really really badly but uh and I understand that sometimes when you're trying to find a bag your foot can get further deeper into the bag and getting away in a runner but I've watched that play a hundred times\nAnd uh it seems to me man he had a lot of options other than dragging his left foot across the he'll\nUh and and you know it just seemed like he was mad that he grounded out and he took it out on a first baseman\nYeah it was it was just the ... there's going to have it both ways at this postseason where by that game with his hair grabbing a after the show the way the shortstop per second base but uh\nYeah yeah there's going to say about Mary is when he first came up because there's\nNot a ton of players that I watch it while this got special he was one of them got Bob so for the child respected either they they yeah I think he has a great pleasure is clubhouse by ... by her that um you know you don't like it is because of\nSome of the ethics and things like that but\nUm you know the the basic see what happens is off the ... to ... I Would say oh even overpriced operate he's ... ... ... or ... or ... somebody said to a shower such suitors\nYeah it's you know I I I can see the talent is obvious uh but you know that if you're the marketing department and the public relations department of the team that science these guys they're going to say oh boy oh boy or\nAre we going to need some vacation time when this summer because they do is they bring this X factor\nI I think in some ways Bryce Harper even more but you know cause so much attention was on them\nBut it was just it's just unfortunate that for whatever reason a many\nUh and Machado has these incidents that are totally within his control and then that bizarre interview where he just outright says I don't I'm not Johnny hustle I don't like to run down to first base it's like come on come on man\nOr a you know give a draw please but nonetheless he's hitting the ball and he's been the best hitter for the Dodgers in the postseason so they're going to certainly live with that the rest of this year\nWe'll see what happens after that I'm encouraged shot you know we can't escape it because he has the clause and has a contract the option to leave theoretically this could be the\nLast uh start at Dodger Stadium of Clinton corrosion a Dodger uniform\nI find it hard to believe that that Clinton current show would leave the Dodgers with his tightened his with Sandy Koufax and just\nThe heat I mean in ... one of those guys that strikes me Sean is having a real sense of the history of the game and his place in the history of the game and his place in the history of the game show like a World Series ring to go with it but he's gotta at some point understand that he's part of the DNA and the Los Angeles Dodgers\nYeah no I I\nI Would be shocked that you know where to talk to you next year you it's rare to how\nHe ... a generational player she have a ... or ... years twenty you're a guy like chipper Jones ... already because for a short guy it's important for city it was ... to have that person you have you're not always similar to that\nState last that long but some would be\nThe best picture of a generation where he said before I read that you know you can't\nGossip I think from ... from ... percent there as well as step but so yeah I\nI have the right thing but it's obviously the dish issue as well so um maybe maybe it will turn to like a little ... uh but I I\nI'd be shocked if you or it just ...\nYeah that's how I see it too but of course I've been shocked by a lot of things in life so [laughter] I don't know right [laughter] hey listen ... or like you know if\nHe was with a visual it that does have a chance to win or two so if that went down to the doctor if the team where you know like the angels whether sort of flailing around that's what every year\nAnd uh and then you know there is always the wild card he's from Dallas in one of the Texas Rangers said once you come home or\nHouston said hey how'd you like to come close to home and we've got a good team and you know there's always those things that can play in but uh and when we should know by the way to that or she sadly is playing his final games or in ... if

of\n'em and since Dianne Feinstein is maintaining radio silence we're fortunate to have a conversation for you with the other candidate state senator Kevin daily on\nThe wording Doug how're you doing if I agree with you thank you so much for the opportunity\nNo we appreciate it and I mean is sincerely you and I don't agree on a lot\n[laughter] book we can agree on a here we want you to listen to you\nHere's one thing that we absolutely agree on that it is important that the candidates who want to be a serving the people of California in such a powerful position the United States Senate actually talk to the constituents to the citizens and Senator Feinstein has failed in that regard for decades uh\nIn doing this for almost a quarter of a century and she has never accepted a single invitation to come on and talk\nOr to the people of California you have a Senator Boxer used to come on with us ah and and it's not in my ego I it doesn't it it doesn't snow skiing off my nose I just find it\nA obnoxious when people want to represent\nThe people of California is one of the greatest honors and they don't want to talk to them I mean I just think it's disrespectful\nWell I I can tell you this\nIs that it's been closed for two decades um Eighteen years to be exact uh since the last time\nSort of ... step out for a debate stage\nAnd debated her opponent um I think that many California's know who she is she has Ninety five percent name recognition but quite frankly they don't know she stands on the positions that are important to California it's like like you said duck you and I may not agree on some things I'm sure there's a quite a few things we can agree on but\nI think what is most\nMost important to California's that doesn't make a difference to go to Donald Trump another Republican candidate Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to me um I think every voter deserves a respect\nBy having um several debates I'm a live television so the maximum amount of viewers in California and actually making the decision that they want to represent them in the Washington DC again regardless it doesn't make a difference to me if you're a Republican Democrat\nPoints in between if you're agnostic I don't care about politics of politicians altogether it but the important thing is if you don't get\nAbout politics as you know very well politics gets involved with you whether you like or not\nThat's exactly right ah well let me ask you the just the broadest possible clashing and then take a whack at why do you want to be United States senator from California\nOh let me tell you this because I think ah do we need leadership that's on a ... not on the sidelines these are very consequential times in our nation's history and I think that was the status quo in Washington is either unwilling or\nIncapable of fighting back um you know you know I'm a I'm a Democrat and I think you know very well uh the positions I have taken statewide I might have worked very
