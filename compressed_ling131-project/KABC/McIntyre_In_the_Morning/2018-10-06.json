Kavanaugh seems likely to be confirmed as the next justice of the U.S Supreme Court\nYesterday Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced Kevin all would get

commercial research at the national association of real tours George welcome to real estate today\nPakistan it's good to be here chatting with you\nWe are so glad you're here so George let's start with why so many foreign investors put their money in American real estate why is that\nExcellent question Steven and to put that in perspective the United states is known worldwide number one obviously is the largest economy but to as an economy in a country which\nHas a very strong private property rights and\nBut when you combine the two so strong property rights with a growing economy which also means a growing real estate environment you have a very appealing proposition for a lot of foreign buyers for looking for stability number one for their capital and to any returns a bonus on top of that\nInteresting so George who are these foreign buyers and what countries do they come from the\nBuyers come in a sense from pretty much all over the world obviously ah we have a few particular countries which leads the list and here I think of China I think of Canada Mexico India\nAnd a few countries in Europe like kingdom being at the top of that list\nI see and are these people looking for vacation homes or do the foreign buyers tend to rent out these houses and generate income\nSo it's a combination of things so we have a detail when whenever we tried to get this information we we're on a survey of our members and we try to detail how many of these are folks looking for a vacation investment or how many of them may be for example temporary residents like diplomats\nForeign students and so on and it turns out that basically we're or a little bit split between so looking at twenty Eighteen those who are non residents so uh that didn't have a ... purchase about fifty a three billion dollars worth of real estate and the resident types\nPurchased close to sixty eight billion dollars so the resident maybe edging but just a little bit to the non resident\nYou know George I was so interested in one specific part of your new report on the international real estate and that is that the most transactions by foreign buyers happened in five states can you tell us about that\nThey absolutely tend to be what I Would call sunshine state traditionally so Florida tops that list as a major destination followed by not surprisingly California Texas Arizona and New York as sort of the top five\nAnd then ... the rounding up but you know some of the other states are Georgia and New Jersey Ohio Virginia\nAnd North Carolina so you can tell they're a lot of coastal\nAreas where foreign buyers tend to buy they also tend to be a vacation destination not surprisingly Florida for example California Arizona with markets like Los Angeles San Francisco Miami obviously being at the top of that is\nInteresting but George as we saw in the latest report the shortage of homes for sale and home values which are not chewing up has caused a rather significant drop in foreign investment in American realistic\nYou're absolutely right in fact when prices you know looking over the last five years or prices in the U.S\nHave gone up over forty percent now when you couple that with with the exchange rate for various countries that basically has made a lot of us are real estate\nRelatively speaking a lot more expensive during this period which not surprisingly has put the brakes on some of the activity during this last year and now when we surveyed our members\nIn addition to you have an economic as well as regulatory issues for example European economy has rebounded\nSince then the concern of twenty sixteen in addition Asian economies have gained strength still for a lot of foreign buyers there are a lot more attractive destinations for second homes\nAround the world so some of that is also contributing to the declining sales\nA it's very interesting George now if I Am an American homeowner and I'm putting my house on the market\nSelling it to a foreign buyers can be a very attractive proposition because they generally pay all cash and many of them aren't really that worried about the purchase price\nYou're absolutely right in fact the one of the things that stood out in the survey was that for a lot of foreign buyers even when the strong price appreciation of the last years us home prices remain a relatively affordable for many of them compared to their\nOwn countries prices so what we see is when they come here they tend to buy also more expensive homes so for example on average foreign buyers paid about four hundred and fifty four thousand dollars\nPer typical home when you consider that the average price of all the existing homes sold in that state and you know twenty Eighteen was two hundred and Ninety One thousand dollars\nIt tells you that they ought to be willing to pay a premium they tend to do obviously buying more expensive locales but they also tend to by larger home so\nObviously if you are a seller for 'em by can certainly be a very attractive proposition\nWonderful well George I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about international real estate with us thank you\nYou're very welcome Stephen always a pleasure talking with you\nYou to George George we're to the director of housing and commercial research at the national association of

information and best practices with real estate pros from other countries let's talk about that now with a real tour who was deeply involved in it\nJoining us now is calling Milan real tour and

incoming any our President Johnson maybe what exactly is that role and what will you be doing\nSo great question Steve and and and I'm Glad to have the opportunity to answer it all of the aid on that work for the existing president they're Thirteen of us that we are the connecting point of that committee that any are which there are more than eighty\nAnd we monitor what goes on in that community we make sure that if there's something that needs the president's attention we can get a prioritized by the president for immediate action\nThat's interesting we all know that an hour is constantly discussing real estate and real estate best practices with industry professionals from around the world tell us comment why is that important\nSteven there's lots of reasons with important the national association of realtors has been the guiding light for real estate professionalism in this country is Nineteen away and other real estate companies and agencies districts around the world that benefit\nWorking directly with any are and they they needed a Catholic and thank God is several years ago in Australia the legislators decided they were going to put a cap on commission rates charged by ... market and they did at one percent data and consulted with NPR's chief lobbyist here in Washington DC and what they're experts\nHe said health they went back and lobbied that legislature in Australia and were successful so there are many reasons why international real estate organized and otherwise benefits\nFrom the experience that any art ad from the fight that we've had in the legislature and around the country ensuring that we have a viable unhealthy real estate market\nThat is such good information and just to sit helps real estate professionals in countries all around the globe working within a are can also help those professionals provide a better experience for their real estate buyers and sellers correct\nAbsolutely there is no doubt that being around other real estate professionals regardless of whether they're from this country and sharing that experience what it says and what they say and how they do it\nGive us unique insights into sometimes how we can better do our jobs or we think something we never thought of in a different way there is just tremendous benefit from being around Fela professionals and understanding just really how good we have it here because of any are\nJust so interesting you know when you think about international real estate calm and you have Americans looking to buy homes overseas and then you have a lot of foreign nationals coming to the United states to buy real estate is your role as liaison to global committees going to have any impact on that activity\nI think one of the key takeaways from the conversations I've had with President Johnson maybe is to make sure that the liaison and the contact we have those countries are indeed bringing the best and they are\nAs well as making sure that those countries are represented the best or are they are so they're getting the most trouble just as much as we're getting the most from them\nSo we're really hoping to raise the bar on real estate of an industry across the globe\nWhich doesn't happen overnight but really folks are going to ensure that we have the quality relationship with the best professionals in place that makes sure that those

estate today because you love real estate [noise]\nAnd we're back with our special show going global all about international real estate and you know buying a home\nFor over the border is one of those things that many people here in America dream about it's just such an over the top romantic notion the very idea of buying a vacation home a retirement home or even an investment property in another country\nBut for a lot of Americans it's not a dream it's a reality because they've done it\nAnd if you'd like to join their ranks by buying duct condo in the heart of London that ranch way out in the Australian outback or even a fishing lodge in British Columbia well you can so let's pick a few moments now to talk about how to make that happen\nFirst of all you have to find the property wheelchair dot com can help with that they have a huge international search engine and it just got a lot bigger so that's a great place to start\nNext to talk to a real chore here in the U.S one with the CIA PS designation that stands for certified international property specialist real tours with that designation have the education the training and the ...\nTo help you make those dreams come true\nIn many cases they already know trusted real estate professionals in the country you're looking at so you won't have to just roll the dice you'll be working with real estate agents in other countries who have proven track records and relationships with real tourists here at home those referrals are really important\nNext up how to pay for it well in most cases you'll have to have cash lined up in advance because getting a mortgage in a foreign country that's not easy so many people use the equity in their American house to do the deal or there's sell stock others might even cash in a four O. one K.\nBut whatever approaches right for you\nBe sure to talk to your accountant before you make any big financial moves now if you do want a mortgage we've heard it might be possible if you work with a major international bank which has branches both here in the United states and in the country where you're buying property now there's no guarantee\nBut with locations in both countries it will be easier to track your credit you'll reserves and your income\nThe biggest of the big American banks all have offices around the world so it's worth looking into\nAnother issue is the exchange rate if it were to swing up or down you might end up either saving a lot of money or paying a lot more there are companies that let you lock in and exchange rate for a fee\nBut it might save you from having sudden unexpected sticker shock when you get to the closing table in that foreign country\nNow we mentioned your accountant to a few moments ago and this next part of advice is for them also\nTaxes it's really important especially if you're buying an investment property to know what your tax situations going to be if you buy a property in another country\nBut whether that property generates income or not find out all the tax implications because some day you might sell it and obviously you won't have the luxury of the capital gains exemption or the ten thirty one like kind of exchange like you do here in the United states\nSpeaking of which here in the usa when you buy something you own it\nBut that's not always the same deal in other countries you might on the house but not the land that sort of thing so you'll have to have trust it professionals on the ground in the land where you're buying property\nTo find out which brings us to our last piece of advice when you buy a house and investment property a retirement home or anything else in another country\nGet and attorney art international real estate expert real tort Patricia tan says always have an attorney by your

need to confirmed judge Kavanaugh but only by hair the final confirmation that comes after two key senators announced they will vote yes Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd that's like the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go over with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nDoing very on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called\nQ tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very ah what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting jak jak as my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and just puppy now\nWays fifty pounds I mean this is this is when you look at her she's like a big dog you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd us it'd be the update 'cause people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this submission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and boom a gallon a pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she peas right on the patio and her colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but\nI Hope so [laughter] anyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand dollar jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that the unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days with that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like

... than I Am your host ...\nDashed [noise] I have been in the financial services business now for I've been a certified financial planner professional rather for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nCourt justice Brett Kavanaugh or is he vanished to the land of unwanted judges toddlers shreds over one day a day\nPlucking marijuana is not great for you so doctors would

with Ken array of course I Am your host Kenmore rape\n[noise]\nSecond jak I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over a thousand four hundred families and forty three states and\nWe are a retirement planning specialists so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stopped\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisor for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collect it and\nIt's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages different state income different in health all those kinds of things there actually\nEight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and\nWhat's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nSo how do you figure that at all well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that is right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated you know our advisors in our farm we put a we we have in fact the\nStarting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait until I'm Seventy\nAnd start collect Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually\nStart when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six to start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy eight increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive there to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to weigh two you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher\nOkay so if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to weigh two you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to is that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter]\nIf you don't want and I'll take it [laughter] but uh anyway yeah so if you if you feel that uh you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut ah there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period than we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash\nFlow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement\nSo

E. M. S. health education maintenance and support so what the heck\nThat mean I mean how you to find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support they can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so if they if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle they can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to they have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the Q tip trust and they can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but cue tips easier to say\nAnyway if you would like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass on to the fore mentioned greedy and washed undeserving airs\nA than what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit\nNow when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon okay so that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire financial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions\nWe want to help you with a retirement planning decisions or income tax decisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who is retired retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions\nAnd if we can help you that's fantastic will do it at no charge obligation\nAnd if we cannot help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part French\nDora the it is not too wonderful to be true because it is true so do that okay now\nIf you don't want to go directly to an advisor than what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much and uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net\nAt the same or we're going to talk about the several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions are going to talk about how to protect yourself and the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above\nWell you know what Jack I cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise] information presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject was God's hands and not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security mentioned none of this show's content viewed as personalized investment by a professional\nAdvisor should be consulted before implementing many of the strategies presented numerous times advancements in malls varying degrees of ribs and therefore getting no insurance at any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for my portfolio tax\nState planning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nProfessional regarding years that they make legal or tax situation founded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of ... or ...

[noise] guarantee\nYou the only guy doing home improvement radio play and Snoop Dogg nice to nice to have two two two fifty two twenty two I don't know if our guest is going to want to stay on now every player to Snoop Dogg tell me about the flooring\nAnd you're home do you like what it looks like do you realize you have like a zillion choices ah well we figured returned to an expert this morning Jeffrey ... is owner and founder and CEO of universal hardwood flooring and molding\nAre headquartered in West Los Angeles California Jeffrey thanks so much for joining us this morning\nYes pleasure to be speaking with you for it to\nTell me a little bit about your company a you guys have been around since Nineteen Ninety five\nThe correct yeah um I always liked hardwood flooring before I started the company but in Nineteen Ninety five I saw that was an eating those marketplace\nAnd so I can actually from the aviation background a really ... it's all a different angle um so you know being an aviation pilot a coming from a more technical aspect and then you know from my hands and knees as a contractor\nRight um well I share your uh your passion for hardwood flooring while there's certainly a lot of choices out there and and and as we both can agree on I'm sure there's a lot of crap [noise] um I have always been a such a proponent of hardwood flooring because I think it's you know it's first of all\nA you know when you talk about authentic real you know three quarter inch thick foreign it's the only renewable floor that you can put down where you can make it look as beautiful you know Fifteen Years from now as it was the day you put it down\nBut also it's one of those added value propositions when you go to sell a home it's the kind of thing you know that makes a listing sheep when they're talking about oh it's close to transportation and it's got a beautiful view of the mountains or whatever and it's got you know hardwood floors\nUm I just think it's such a great choice\n[laughter] yeah and and and to a kind of attack on to what we're saying there on the first part um I always say to people hardwood floor and you're kind of like a cat it has nine lives so kind of like what you're talking about when you when you buy hardwood flooring it's the hardwood floor and you're buying now\nAnd provided you do get a good quality hardwood floors if the next two or three floors you'll have\nYears in Twenty years so she only surfaced that you can send down and then in ten years or if you had a of a kind of a a chocolate brown or a walnut floor whitewash Florida ten years and then I'd write and years maybe a hot pink is the the\nColor is a a with hardwood flooring\nNow you said something when you first started in in this red when you started talking was the fact that if you get a\nReally good quality floor mats it isn't just when you say oh you want to hardwood floor choosing the right manufacture and getting the right stuff really does make a difference\n[noise] absolutely and and to some degree it's kind of very similar to automobiles I mean you you see people driving around in cars right now in Los Angeles or not everybody's driving up an inexpensive of you know a vehicle to a lot of people are saying well\nI did the calculations that pulled out my spreadsheet and actually getting that you know a Tesla or maybe a more expensive vehicles actually at the end of the day a less expensive as so I'm don't always look for the least expensive floor 'cause it sometimes at the end of the day the most expensive for\nRight just ... just I just remember this whether you install a really inexpensive floor\nOr use install an expensive quality for labor to do the installation is exactly the same or should be almost exactly that say right and you can advertise out a call for a lot and a lot more years than an inexpensive floor that'll have to be ripped out ten years or five years\nNow when you started back in ah in Ninety five you know the the kind of choices that people had when it came to a flooring was you know oh maple cherry a you know maybe maybe another exotic that were out there\nTalking a little bit about how the uh the selection of woods PCs now has really grown exponentially\nYeah it's it's interesting you're right you're absolutely are asking the right questions so he's a very interesting and I have an answer for all of those questions\nAre essentially the hardwood flooring industry went through the same revolutionary explosion that the wind industry went into so if you look at wind in the Nineteen seventies you know your Gallo red wine and get white wine that was pretty much it right you've had an explosion of choices and the hardwood flooring industry right now at so\nI'm you've got a different species or you've got bamboo which is not even award it's grass\nUm you've got white okay and then you've got huge amounts of treatments or whether it's a wire brushed or hands scraped so basically now when you go into what flooring stores I'm just like going into the wind industry you literally are overwhelmed with choices\nWhich to some degree now makes it much more complicated because back in the heyday your choice was like you said I'm going to do read open with the wider so your ... your choices were a lot\nSimpler in those days but you know we're uh we're in the market now where you know your choices are are large\nWell and the other thing too right Jeffrey is I think for the vast majority of homeowners they don't realize that you know somebody like you know as a foreign store right you got a lot of selection writing it a lot of expertise\nRight now we're so big box focus right that they go into the big box and they say oh yeah hardwood look they got it right here that looks great you know and there's really not a choice her selection or yeah maybe they can special order something but it's not something that they see\nA tool and die if you're a tap and diet tap is like a a a ... or it's like a a male and with has threads on it that you would put into this out of the proper size and as you tighten it up it actually cuts the threads\nSo that it except the screw now oh the average person Linda doesn't have a tap and die set nor did they know how to use one I mean it really isn't that difficult but it's like\nTo go and buy a tapping die set may cost you more than the coffee table so here's what I Would say it has to do um maybe\nYou have a local hardware store that has okay if you have a local a fair telling my son to in her column first and say this is what I have if I brought you this thing and could you do you have a tap that you could help me they may charge you a nominal fee to do something like that but they may have the tools in the back\nTo kind of cranky and a little bit and and reset post threads for you and assemble the whole thing it'd be done\n'cause that's cash that can you don't want to get better\nIf you buy a if you buy it happened I said you'll never use it again for the rest of your life so why ... why purchase something like that\nI err fabulous ... thank you that's a great idea\nAll right well I appreciate you listening and I appreciate your calling this morning have a great day\nOkay it felt\nLike air by by our phone number is eight hundred to two two fifty two twenty two eight hundred to two to five to two two\nAnd I can't get through on the phone lines you can always email me at how smart Stevie dot com where we get back to your phone calls Lindsey do you have a few emails we can answer sure\nThan looking at one that's asking how am I supposed to hang on plaster wall and she said oh\nYeah uh actually I was a I was in New York I Do the today show on a monthly basis with the beautiful a lady's Kathie Lee a Gifford and hold it kept me who are lovely and uh it is one of my favorite things to do\nAnd plaster walls for people with older homes can have a problem hangs up that certainly we're all pretty familiar with um\nWith the command strips and that is probably your easiest option but they make these picture hangars or they have some that are plastic and some that are metal where you put a couple of the command strips on the backside and some of them can actually hold up to eight pounds and they really do work now\nThey will cost you anywhere from three to four dollars a piece and so if you have a bunch of um things to hang it can get quite expensive I'm going to offer you an alternative that I think you probably haven't thought of hardened trim nails\nThat when you go to the hardware store the lumber yard you're going to find trim nails all different kinds and if you buy small little like number for smaller the number of the the smaller the male number four hardened trim nails and those are really developed for if you're putting the hardwood trim and you were doing it by hand\nThese males allow you to use it without pre drilling you probably would still do it a pre drilling\nAnd it won't split the wood and the more than the male which is most important with those um plaster the beauty part of it is that you can just tap tap tap and it will go right into the plaster\nAnd not blow it out and you won't bend the mail and so instead of spending four dollars on one three am commands strip paying your picture you can spend probably three dollars on a one pound box of heart and trim nails that you'll have with the rest of your life so\nUh if you did that and the one thing I Will tell you is those little males are tiny and um so you need to have enough space on your finger so you don't ... eight hundred to two two fifty two twenty two let's do another email\nThis from ... ah that back or they just bought a new house they're downsizing from your rent you know in the case I Love to like a real marble that I'm concerned about keeping the shower clean ... each cleaner ... how can I keep on our most showers sanitary\n... marble is so difficult to uh you got to use the right cleaner there's no question about it because it's such a soft stone that um you'll take the glaze off of it you can even ... um there is an old time brand that's been around forever called London mark and they make a cleaner\nUm that you can put in a spray bottle that will do a really nice job on it\nUm it does take a little bit more work because you can't use things like harsh cleaners I'm marble you can't use a shower cleaner or we talk about this on the radio or on this radio show about the wet and forget shower product can't use that mobile\nSo one thing you can cause it will it will ah damage the stone\nBut if you use this London mark marble cleaner I think that you will find that um it does a really nice job it doesn't come at a spray bottle it comes in a regular on like court almost like a bottle that you would buy and a quarter of oil at the auto parts store is kind of looks like that\nPut that into a spray bottle and leave it in the shower area and use that to clean the shower I think that you'll find that you'll get really good results apart from it and it looks nice\nOther thing too is make sure with with marble it's really important what the ... between the marble and and or the shower base with a tub whatever it might be isn't really good ... repair with marble being so soft even when it's crowded correctly and clean\nIt is not uncommon that water can get behind the stone just because of absorption um because of the stone is so soft and if the ... is not in good repair you'll get moisture trapped behind that and you'll get mildew and mold build up which is problematic so if you're noticing that the Koch isn't looking great\nGift to remove all that Koch and you have to clean it up really well and then you have to put a\nFan on it literally overnight because you have to make sure that it's really dry\nBefore you recall talk at because if you trap the moisture behind their\nThat all that work you just went through to do a really nice talking job is damaged by the um the moisture from behind it and then what's the matter of a month or so you'll see damage there and you're like what happened was because the moisture is is trapped behind it so really do a nice job I like doing a hundred percent silicone\nUm and and that'll be doing All right let's go to Dan right now in Hollywood hey Dan you're on how smart radio good

shingle and can get under the roof and cause a mildew mold and rotting\nSo um I Would absolutely carefully peel up the shingles slide that trip at a gym and if you can tap a couple a just a couple

dot com All right this is back about Marshall PHD this is help line live or we're going to go to the phones now let's go to Rick\nIn San jose California and he's got some bad dandruff ranch on his chest in armpits and the doctor said she used to build up they're probably right\nAre you there Rick Sam how old a man or even how much do you weigh\nI'm sixty nine weigh two hundred pounds\nCircuit well first thing you want to know is it dangerous is everybody has dandruff but when there's excess sugar and going to the scale it intensifies the production of something called see them\nSee them as like a blue and start sticking the dandruff that everybody has together so it becomes visible\nBut otherwise I'm having to Andrew but you can't see it [laughter] it's microscopic in size okay so so the first thing we have to do is tell you you're getting way too much sugar okay and so this of course is the result of not getting enough starch\nWhen we crave sugar we may have depleted or the vitamins so we can't metabolize starch\nAnd or we don't have starch showed a very simple thing is for you to get a copy of the biofuel diet\nAnd the resource list\nAnd shift gears and lay off meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products for a Ninety Days and after the Ninety Days then you'll have a casual lead the foods that are listed there but the ones that said you can have occasionally you don't eat for the first Ninety Days\nNow what this is going to do for you at your age\nIt's going to give you thirty more good years buddy if you're smart if you're a dumbbell you won't follow this it'll kill you the American food will kill you so I'm hoping you're smart and I can tell you the used to build up is also failure of your digestion\nBut that's classic thing that's happening in America I'll show you how to fix that in a minute and then I get some B vitamins like max stress be and I take maybe a couple of teaspoons a day to promote your best starch metabolism and help ... any sugar craving\nOkay now the next thing we've got to do for you desperately is it you're not to eat another cooked food meal without taking digestive enzymes like quantum Dodgers\nAnd you need at least two of these distorted the meal the end of the meal you want about six detain hydro chloride and now you're digesting more like you did in your twenties you'll be lighter you'll be stronger you'll need less sleep\nYou'll see your ideal weight just comes on like a ban she and you're going to feel more like you felt that forty nine instead of sixty nine\nNow sometimes the HDL will burn if it does you drink a bunch of water it'll go away but that's the warning we've got a scar on the center line of the body\nUntil you can get to a cue or a practitioner and get a mug back you'll get something called the stomach support and you'll have to take three capsules at your body size empty him in a cup fill the cup of water do high boom stored up steep it ten minutes cricket before you eat\nNow the HDL will totally agree with you\nAnd now you're digesting well so this yeast problem is is history and you now switching way you're eating so the craving goes away and of course than Andrew ... is a minor side effect that will be gone\nOkay sounds good\nRight buddy just give a budget for the oil and they'll help you got that number\n'em knowing them\nEight eight hundred three Seventy thirty four
