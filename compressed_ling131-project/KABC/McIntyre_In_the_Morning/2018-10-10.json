Arabian consulate dead ...\nSo we'll get into that as well meanwhile uh we told you yesterday that the department of motor vehicles acknowledge that there are opt out a voter registration a plan ahead a little bit of a glitch to report on that ... a little bit further is are very ...\nGood morning a little bit of a glitch last twenty three thousand of these automatic registrations were botched and then the DMV just sent a letter to secretary of state Alex but the on Monday saying another Fifteen hundred people were put on the voter rolls who are eligible to vote\nThat's correct and including a some non citizens and at least one Canadian citizen and they say oh no no no nobody who's in the country illegally was registered to vote how do they know we haven't they know\nThey don't know not out in and out but he said that ... there's no way they can do this you're talking over twenty thousand people that they have to go through now and they have to go through each one of these ... and by the way in and take them off the voter rolls and only the secretary of state can do that but only that but it\nCould very well be that some of these people because this last fit that Fifteen hundred habit of between April in September so many of them could have voted in the June primary\nSo now they have to figure that out to an allergist but he said he he will definitely uh prevent anyone on the voter rolls who're whose ineligible from voting and the number six election but it's the I think the melon stuff vote by mail starts today or tomorrow or something so that's going to be a little difficult to do\nAnd are we sure it's even Fifteen hundred now you know in ... to blunders in fraud or ... and ... and this has always been my great concern about this is that as we've made it easier to register to vote and to vote itself\nWe open up more opportunities for voter fraud on a grand scale and then they all deny that this is happening right oh no no no we have no problem with that but they don't go looking for it\nAnd I mean you know when you have an opt out system where you go and get a driver's I did you're automatically registered to vote unless you physically tell them no I don't want to be registered to vote\nAnd then is there any real way of policing you're supposed to be automatically registered as a decline to state no party preference do we know that that's happening it'd be awfully easy for some ... working in the DMV be registering a lot of people ... hard to imagine they be registering them is Republican but\nYou know I I I mean there's just so much so many opportunities to job this system here\nWell since April when this took effect a three million people have either up have been their voter information has either been updated or um or or registered for the first time three million so\nDon't forget we gave a million drivers licenses to people in the country illegally and California within twelve yes so you know I Wonder thanks Jim pre she ate it either that or maybe Taylor Swift was much more powerful than we thought\nShe did get sixty five thousand people to register to vote and twenty\nAlso the storm surges debate killer for those storms\nOh that's the big concern here storm surge of ten to Fifteen feet think about it give you a quick example all those fancy beach does is it just see along the Gulf Coast Atlantic goes most of those on stilts it or ... feet off the ground we're talking ... ... feet in the peak areas\nAt eight or ... or ... on top of that is a recipe for ... destruction\nOh yeah it could be a very very expensive and a and life threatening storm now that part of the country has had hurricanes before and\nSome of the communities have really taken rather dramatic steps to protect themselves against hurricanes including extending widening the beaches one one one of them over at when I went from like a basically a twenty foot beach to a hundred foot depth ensuring bringing in pumping sand from the uh\nThe Gulf of Mexico so they really taken some pretty dramatic steps in ... they're going to be tested severely on this one\nI Would be holding my breath as far as the efficacy of a puppy and a lot of saying when you're dealing with the storm of this magnitude or however are Galveston, Texas after they're huge ... or the treatment killed those thousands of people\nGo to a active seawall and place but that was\nSort of situation there here on the Gulf Coast of Florida this storm is a is moving relatively quickly if you point out forward speed has increased close to Thirteen or fourteen miles per hour that could be an advantage for the poor hard it residence that will have to deal with this we hope\nOr too much longer the bad part is this storm is headed up into the south beach right\nFine as we've got no frame or in Florida\nRight at ten right into the Carolinas and makes it turned to the north east a last question done and we're talking with Don Parker who's in Pensacola, Florida when is the actual storm expected to hit the panhandle\nProbably or early to the middle of this afternoon but we expected to be in sometime after one PM in the Panama City area for those familiar with the panhandle of Florida between Panama City an Appalachian coal Florida what we call the Big Bend area for that which is that's kind of an aerial ... sticks out and go\nOkay well well obviously a be rooting for everybody down there in harm's way thanks for being with us on appreciate a darker a KBC contributed in Pensacola, Florida around ten o'clock\nThis morning a we will probably see that storm coming ashore for the first time it's going to be a carry well this is a tough storm because again when it comes across the Gulf is what happened in Katrina\nWhen it comes across the Gulf it actually increases in intensity because it's so much heat and not water as opposed to those ... comes out and it's like a ...\nGame speed into whips across the land\nAll right ladies and gentleman so we've got that we are less than a month away from the big mid term election uh with the Congress up for grabs but here in California the governor's mansion is up for grabs\nAnd the two contenders are Gavin Newsom the lieutenant governor of California former mayor of San Francisco and the a business executive the entrepreneur John Cox it was a debate which KBC covered the other day\nA between Mr Cox and a ... and ... avenue some and now to talk to us about that he's John Cox\nRelated to me with you and I'm not sure I caught a debate as much as it was a joint appearance and non Congress Asian conversation\n[laughter] I guess the way of describing it ah I thought that you presented well and the difference between yourself and Gavin Newsom could not be more stark\nAh obviously it's a well it's this is just it's a it's the\nConundrum of modern California that we look at the number of people who are moving out of the state for all of the reasons that you articulated in more\nUh and yet the\nPolicies that led so many people to bail on the Golden State are the policies the Gavin Newsom embraces and doubled down on and looks at as a point of pride\nWell let's look at what we didn't talk about we didn't talk about water rationing which is coming in three years\nYou're not going to be able to take a bath in this state literally or we're gonna rename as a a smelly state or not the Golden State because uh you're going to be able to have a schedule your showers every other day in the state because the political class is going to make you a rash of\nThe amount of water we didn't talk about the homeless situation as you know in LA you got\nTight this outbreak now and it's worse in the San Francisco with the a human tragedy of people living on the streets we didn't talk about the education system that has now rated forty seven in the nation half of our public school children can't read\nTo a a grade level that they're supposed to and despite the fact that we have vastly increased\nThe amount of money almost a hundred billion dollars a year we're spending on education in our our results are just going nowhere but down\nNone of these things and of course we didn't talk about health care which Gavin Newsom wants to take over the same people who are running the DMV and making you wait for hours to get a renewal are going to now be administering your health care\nNone of those issues who are covered instead we talked about a gay marriage and guns now which I'm saying anything\nOut on this trail or that most voters and California care a lot about because they're pretty little subtle\nAnd you know if there's any issue that is representative of how far off the rails California government has gotten in use that term specifically off the rails hits\nAnd the the the rail derail a to know where all\nRight it's against the governor Jerry Brown trained the crazy train which Gavin Newsom knowledge is\n... I mean he uses attempted language like deeply flawed but he's also promised to continue to go forward with this thing and it's ... it's it's the ultimate definitive representative issue of where government has failed in California\nWell and its way over budget but you know given this has gotten asked at a\nRaise taxes so Gavin Newsom was in favor of the gas tax is in favor of destroying proposition Thirteen protections he said that as much as a non debate debate\nAnd or is also for doubling the state income tax to pay for his boondoggle healthcare plan to put him in ... for\nOver all of a health care decision making so you know I just hope the people of California to take a step back and look at what's going on but they're you know the state and say okay we need a change the status quo this at work and we got to do something different\nWe're talking with John Cox is candidate for governor his campaign website is very simple John Cox for governor dot com it's very easy to find a\nToo often in California when we talk about issues in this medium of talk radio and among Republicans conservatives we end up with a laundry list of things that were opposed to that they're doing in Sacramento\nAnd God Knows there's plenty of them uh but uh let's take a minute to talk about what it is you'd like to do because being governor of California is more than just sweeping back the tide of Ben ideas\nNo and it it's\nIt's building more and less expensive homes we spent a good amount of time talking about this that\nYou know he just wants to hand out some subsidies the people I actually want to make it so that we can build affordable homes I build apartments for a living and that's my business and I can build apartment as\nIn other states other than California for relatives fraction I mean we're talking twenty percent\nOf what it costs in Los Angeles I can build an apartment for eighty thousand for example\nIn Indiana which is a lovely apartment nine foot ceilings state of the art appliances for eighty thousand dollars the same apartment in LA to build is four hundred four hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nNow that translates into a much higher rent for people in LA and there's no explanation for that difference except government government government regulations lawsuits delays impact fees taxes\nDriving up this costs so that average hard working for ...

well\nWe got to find out what this is about you know MS Thirteen Marisol but true ship the image Thirteen gang notorious was actually born in Los Angeles so we have to apologize to the world for this one it's always described as a Salvadoran gangs but it was actually born here and then\nExport into a El Salvador and then franchised across the country and it became a particularly are rooted in a Brentwood Long Island islip in central Long Island\nAnd ah\nAnd apparently there are people who live out in the very high uh rent district of the Hamptons in Suffolk County the eastern in Long Island who worry about\nBeing attacked by an image Thirteen gang members and have taken to constructing safe rooms in their houses joining us rented talking about this is a contractor with convert interiors which installs panic rooms both in New York to end it out in the Hamptons some pleasure to welcome to the show Chris cause ban Chris how are you\nVery good thank you\nAppreciate you coming on with us so we certainly seen that yeah and and some Hollywood mansions out here as well and the the reality is especially if you are rich and famous you can be a target and we've seen celebrities who have had to retreat to safe rooms to protect themselves against ... get into the house\nBut why did folks in the Hamptons fear gang members coming to their homes\nWell I'm the information that I Do get from clients a lot of people have you know I'm service people at their house whether it's landscapers or um you know contractors have a you know labor's work with them and a lot of them happened to be you know um I I guess I Would say they work\nIn that field that can be ... members that were was found out so you know a breach at home that has gates ... out in the Hamptons and they you know\nTwice a week he's last April crew's coming to that how homes and service their property and I you know a lot of people say that they feel that they scope out their homes when the horses are are there\nHas there been have there been any reports of Amish Thirteen attacks in mansions in the Hamptons or is this literally just I it it almost sounds like it could be a status symbol\nWell it's both I mean I personally I haven't heard anybody that was attacked you know if I'm going to start to think about their property know myself personnel but a lot of it the homes I Do it started out um you know one person wired up at a grown they're interested now is it\nPretty much seems like a lot of people have a status symbol or bragging rights you know we we get home that ... into a swimming pool and they wanted a pack girls and it turned into a movie room so I think a lot of it is a procedure that bragging rights to the neighbors\nWere ... look we've spoken to a number of a contract to build a fallout shelters like ... you know the ... home or yeah you know for ... you know prepare for the apocalypse and doomsday ers doomsday ...\nSo whatever floats your boat it's their money if they want to spend the money that way it just it really it's hard not to see this as\nA a a a pro right to life episode of any show they just are\nNever going to do it they just won't do it the if if the anti abortion position is represented in a show it is almost always with some maniac who's trying to blow up an abortion clinic or bully some young girls somewhere in some horrible what\nThat's just the way it is they can never be an episode of any network television show where the right to life issue was presented as a moral choice as a as somebody who just passionately believes that it's human life and it should be preserved\nOkay so there's that book the war in shows have seen a big\nFall off not just because of politics because younger people aren't interested they look at them as old fogy events ...

I\nI just don't want to watch people pontificate about politics is bad enough we're doing it here five hours a day I don't want to watch it during an award show\nUp so\nThere's that but what I don't get is\nThe politics and sports things coverage of sports on ESPN has become more political but\nWhen I'm actually watching a sporting event I\nDon't see any politics involved I don't know what they're talking about ... section of the national anthem controversy with the NFL but most about the actual\nEvent is ... is the event and ... they don't broadcast the national ... well I used to they're starting to drop that now yeah but the bottom line is ... electric and well I watched every pitch every inning of the baseball playoffs there's been no politics and yes and that and I think what\nPeople are I think people are just putting into their own idea that\nBecause everybody follows if if if you're a big sports fan you follow all of your people that you like on social media\nAnd so everybody now has their own Twitter and their own Instagram and they're on Facebook and they're all political everybody has their opinion and they talk about it all the time and they have their own opinions and they it's every day and relentless and I think that they ... you know they\nStart out at all I just love Ron James is running up and down the court and then talking about Donald Trump right not no he's right on the court plant bath right but they sort of see it as like well if I watch LeBron James in their mind they're like oh he's so political so I'm not going to watch his basketball game even though he's not you're right we're just watching the basketball\nBut I don't want to watch him because he believed that and a lot of the ...\nI see that all the time I see like we saw this with Taylor Swift because Taylor Swift spoke out about a couple of congressional races\nLast night on on the right and now people are going to say well I've never listening tour and that's your right by the way he had been president jumped at I'm listening to music twenty five percent land you can do whatever you want to do\nI never hold people's politics against their art or against friendship right I I just don't because people were people have you ever had any and I just have to really\nThis is why I play video games there's no politics and poke him on\nA six fifty for talk radio seven ...\nRich plumbing eight eight eight seven five seven rich no router man here family owned and only full service professional plumbers kitchen and bathroom\n... tank lose water heaters earthquake values gas lines and yes routers service to rich blaming specializes in trench Lou sewer repair green cleaning and maintenance was Eighteen love interest refinancing as possible call rich\nAmong only full service professional plumbers rich plumbing seven five showed an R.

Deasy Los Angeles county cumulus station\nA split the difference between allowing people to say their piece a including if it's perhaps harsh and at what point do they have the legal right to rein it in well the LA city council voted unanimously last Tuesday to crack down\nOn people who repeatedly disrupt excuse me this Tuesday that repeatedly disrupt their meetings at city to city hall defying attorneys and activists to charge that the new rules trample on free speech rights beginning in January people who are repeatedly injected from city council or committee meetings\nFor shouting from the audience or other quote disruptive ... can be banned from attending other meetings that day and for up to six additional meeting days at a time\nSo let's find out from the civil liberties perspective a where we stand on this civil rights attorney a pleasure welcome back to the show Carol Sobel Carol how are you\nOn great thank you\nI appreciate you coming on I I really understand both sides of the arguments because uh I understand how\nSome people can really be a notch as belligerent but out outright abusive\nA and their behavior can be disruptive to other people's rights\nAnd to me that is always the threshold is that your right to free speech and when it imposes on somebody else's right to free speech but ah but also this is a very dangerous ground when you start banning people from public comments or ... at the city council\nThat's the last place we should be limiting free speech in my opinion so what should the standard be here\n[laughter] so I think it's sometimes hard standard uh to define what concerns me is that the public statements of the president of the city council indicate he doesn't understand where the line is so for example one of the issues that he raises his people waving their arms\nIn the audience the courts have been really clear it has to be a substantial disruption and things like waving your arms just simply aren't\nAnd the example actually is an act of it up a progressive activists who was upset with the Santa Cruz city council stood up and gave a a a ... you know raise his arm and like a Nazi salute he got\nArrested kick out of the meeting it went all the way to the federal appeals court in a federal appeals court said\nSo what he he was quiet you can stand up and do that that doesn't disrupt the meeting so should lie concern is\nUh not that you can't have rules as she council meeting but how do you apply those rules and I don't think that the city council is equipped to do that because they operate off fish a solution that\n... they operate off of their injured feelings about some of this and that's not a good way if you're a public official show somebody insults you big deal you don't like it get another job\nWell that's how I see it too and I don't think that the LA city council specifically a recognizes how they have infuriated so many members of the public\nBy treating the the uh ... first of all limiting a speech to two minutes and treating the people who have taken the time to come down to city hall and gone through the hassle of getting in the bill finding a place to park getting into the building waiting their turn signing up\nAnd then they're literally ignored that it is with us patently obvious if you watch channel thirty five which is uh\nLA thirty five which is the city television so you can watch the\nCouncil meetings and it it's obvious that when somebody has a complaint about their policies they're not interested in hearing them they're ... they're the disrespect to the citizenry the outer disregard the citizenry is palpable\nWell I think there's another issue here too which is that the city council tend to want to operate a what's called a consent calendar which avoid any public discussion of issues that come before he got in the city council rule is that if something goes to a community\nAnd they you have an opportunity disgusted at committee when it comes to the city council they can put it on the consent calendar and you never have an opportunity to discuss it for if you're a an engaged person in the city and you don't find out about important issue until after a committee votes on it you're out of luck\nNot the way democracy works\nWell is the way California democracy works we're talking with Carol Sobel because essentially what's going on at LA city hall is a replica of what goes on in Sacramento and has for years because uh we now have a large percentage of the city council members including her blessing the city council president\nWho have Sacramento experience and ah in Sacramento good luck a actually\nEngaging with the elected representatives up there they they have themselves quarantined from access to not only the public but the press itself they have a press room and unless you actually unless a state of some of them in our state senator wanders into the press room\nThere is no a back hallway access for a border to corner somebody and talk to them they've done the same thing as LA city hall no\nCure and see what happens is a public goes out to the events where the mayor is appearing or\nOr how much of learning and then and then because the mayor encounter person don't want you to stay there they simply move their event someplace else yeah how is that even gauge ...\nYou know it it it's it's extraordinary I Know that's happening a lot around some of the homelessness issues now and you know I'm On one side of the issue I may be a different side from homeowners but I think that people have the right to tell their elected officials what they think about that\nI couldn't agree with you more on the I mean I'm totally with you on this now again a there are people who can be\nIncredibly abusive it happens in this line of work on my line of work I I have a couple of uh people who are habitual emailers to the show and they don't like the show they don't like me like my opinions and that's fine\nUh we put stuff out there and when you have an opinion on something or not everybody's going to like it if you can't stand it uh then you should go as you said go get another job nobody put a gun to anybody's had to run for office or to become a talk show host but at some point\nAh when you've been called a ... an effort and the language has been abusive and there's no actual exchange going on here it's just it's just invective then you just stop answering and you just when you see the emails come in you just hit the lead and you're done with it\nBut I haven't blocked anybody I don't block people from sending emails in here\nUh but I Do acknowledge there are a couple of people after all these years uh I don't read the email anymore now I'm not governing anybody I\nI have no authority to tax people to imprison them to pass laws that can impact their lives in one way or another that that that's a different thresholds when you're on a legislative body\nI agree and I had you know doing the work that I Do I have the same situation with phone messages people eat me letters they sent me um people who uh cost me at you know it in public events so I understand that my role now is to engage them and to see if I Can't\nTalk to them person to person um but public officials don't do that for the most part because their show insulted\nThat someone would speak to them in a pejorative tone of voice or or NPR of words and I've had public officials in Mississippi telling me when they each tried to introduce similar measures in the past they say but they were calling me names and I said so what get another job if you don't like it\nWell you know it it it's a bubble that our elected officials have managed to ah create for themselves you know I used to argue that\nOf the three categories of celebrity\nBeing athletes actors and politicians\nThat actors living the biggest bubble because they might get a bad review now and then but when people meet actors in public as a general people are very very complimentary and and what they want ... with them in honor of his on over the ... whereas ballplayers know even the home team fans will turn on them if they\nLast night a gym Carlos as John Carlos sent and\nWas booed by the Yankee fans for striking out\nIn the ninth inning by the home team fans and politicians go into office knowing that forty nine percent of the public if not forty nine and a half percent hate their guts\nBut what once they're in office they were they have created a bubble around themselves that literally insulate them from interacting with the people whose lives they can have tremendous impact over\nBy absolutely agree uh I could not agree more and they think that they're doing a very often they think that they're above that that you have no right to criticize them that is the essence of democracy well there are some people who get out of hand but\nBut um you know but they have rules that allow them to remove somebody from the room\nAnd they don't need to expand those rules and just create a more ambiguity to what you what is it that you do get that offensive and and and makes you lose your right to participate in those public event\nWell it starts in the campaign is I mean we've got a governor's race right now in a Senate race\nWhere whatever you think of the candidates it's outrageous to gather new some and John Cox of only had one debate to be the chief executive for an hour on a radio you know for a state that's but that's larger than the most nations and economically more powerful than almost every nation on earth except for maybe six or eight\nDeal with thirty passengers on the bus and they're videotaping the monkey driving the bus on because they thought it was cute and nobody complained and apparently the monkey was

story that apparently more than a hundred kids\nHad been found safe in Michigan during the one day operation by the U.S Marshal Service or find out what this is all about a hundred missing children Steve casts about I'm reporting for Steve good morning\nYeah good morning pretty amazing when you look at the numbers it's quite astonishing you're right it's um several different or police agencies and other law enforcement agencies that got together with the U.S marshals and and they started working on a more than three hundred open\nMissing children cases and they were successful in finding well over a hundred of those missing children throughout the one county in Michigan\nOr some of these um uh uh well a lot of them were runaways you know the the turn out to be kids who ran away from home for one for one reason or another and having been heard from since but that's a lot of kids to to find in just one sweep\nSome of them they they questioned all them to see if any of them had been a human traffic had been sexually trafficked are or were being victimized and that way we are being forced into prostitution and a small number of them they they are found they declared a had been and other pursuing cases in in those instances but\nYou're right this is pretty pretty amazing that they were able to track down more than a hundred of these these missing children because so often when when someone runs away from home and a teenager runs away for a lot of families practically Selassie ever hear from them\nI'm now this is all from one catch it here it says Wayne County Michigan is this just from one county\nYeah this is just in one county it's an operation that the um you know I've been working on for awhile apparently in conjunction with the U.S marshals\nIt now as Steve is there any indication that Wayne County Michigan a ... is protect particularly vulnerable to this kind of crime or can we extrapolate from this that if they could come up with a hundred missing

watch I Am really\nMuch less inclined to watch an award show because I'm just tired of it I'm tired of the one sided quote unquote jokes and the monologues and then the inevitable a sanctimonious a you know speech fine\nSo I you know I'm Out on that for a largely political reasons most people are out on just largely it's not entertaining reasons yeah ... and I get that too I mean we we've all taught discussed that younger people look at things like the Academy Awards\nAnd the Grammys as old fogy events\nBecause they have the American Music Awards they have the people's choice awards or they just don't care because\nThey're not swayed by that they're not swayed by an Oscar wins a necessarily or or the awards in general\nSo there's a lot of reasons why the audience has fallen off plus technology allows people to find out the winters without spending three hours of their lives watching a thing\nBut but there are many many people who have chosen not to watch not just award shows but a scripted series as well because\nIf you have a drama and it's going to deal with a political issue it's almost inevitable that the conservative point of view is going to be the bad guy and I'd also like to point out usually a cartoon representative of a bad guy\nUh I I used to have this uh argument over ... when when West Wing was a big hit show west one was brilliantly written the actors were great it was a wonderful show\nBut I have a lot of friends of mine liberal friends of mine who used to talk about how great the west wing was in terms of discussing political issues said look I I could win every argument I'm ever in if I get to write what the other side says\nAnd that was you know that that that was like spike in football yeah or the liberal argument always sort of comes out ahead in the west wing because liberals are writing the arguments so they get to control what the other side gets to say that's a pretty sweet way of winning a political debate\nSo uh you know people have just had to get fed up with it and they don't want to watch it for political reasons as a general rule I don't do that with art I don't hold and this is my personal viewpoint you certainly free to do what you want\nA but I don't usually let an artist personal ...\nPolitics affect my reaction to their art whether they were an actor or they're a a a a singer or a comedian or whatever I I could appreciate what they're doing ... ... even if they have very different politics than I Do\nA ... the one I don't get is why so many people now saying that this affects the way they watch sports yeah what is that if they come out with the exception of the controversy over a Colin Kaepernick a kneeling during the national anthem\nOnce the game starts his politics involved in this and I think the players are rounding second base yelling Trump's socks and there's\nNo look into the field though that running back to the never Trump or I Can't like him\nIn fact for the most part sports are pretty patriotic even if there is kneeling news off the air force fly over missing man formation parish shoe drops is that they sing God Bless America in the seventh inning it's one of the you know places

no a single raindrops plays itself or the flood\n[laughter] well I mean you know\nIf you're trying to to talk about solving the problem um I think we should appreciate that you know it's it is true if you're a member of the system you're probably doing quite well but um their their voices tend to carry more weight I'm so it is a bit odd that someone who's who's benefiting um would\nYou know pointing out the failing to the system but that those things can both be true right um and so I think I mean anyone who's apparently a voice of a fiscal reason on Saturday or to this issue should be well funded\nSo ah you know when you get into this issue what we are told because we've covered it many many times\nUh we're we're told is that because of the back and deals that the unions have gotten from the politicians it's cheaper to pay overtime even these numbers are enormous it's cheaper to pay overtime to a handful of firefighters are cops\nThan it is to hire somebody knew because when you hire somebody knew then you start a whole new pension and\nHealth uh you know a gravy train basically is what happens and the costs are so expensive it just it costs more money to hire new people even at lower starting salaries than it is to just pay the existing people a fortune in overtime\n[noise] right so that there's two points there I'm One that isn't always necessarily true especially when you look at agencies like the Orange County fire authority where\nSo much with their overtime goes to fire captains you have the salaries of one channel and twenty\n[noise] um and so if you were to get an entry level firefighter in starting salary around six or seven day um but actually would be closer to watch but the real issue there is a false assumption um\nThat every hour of overtime pay reflect someone out there on the front lines fighting fires that is simply falls and they make it very easy for us to do this without actually being there and the guys because one of the things they do just as a ... you know that all of\nTheir way equating pay is they\nHave the Haitian as if you were actually working for the purposes of calculating all car so it's a simple example\nIf you're supposed to work days a week\nAnd some are saying that among the ... first as a when you come back\nOne day that every minute of that on board of war is over I I don't think although it move on with a cell phone or on bail it will be overtime but of course there are whole of the ... and the pilots and the weight and contracts are written max by us so that really\nUm I think ... ... ... to say oh you guys played out seven thousand Alice O'Toole to the doctor it'll last five years down the Fort Lauderdale pulse and I thought well will accrue I Would never come up but not\nUm and this is talk of local for for ... and some of the guys are ... ... ... ... you will see that are retiring or alcohol ... fighters director for the cardinals who brought this to our culture and um so that was a real far\nWe're talking with Robert Filner who's the director transparency research at the California Policy Center a\nIs another story to this appeared in the daily breeze that ah Inglewood police chief\nA mark a front to road to\nI've got an extra sixty one thousand dollars in pay last year a ... and the reason is apparently he attended a two week\nUm course\nAnd for some reason city officials now say that the bonus had been ... admitted from a a memorandum of understanding approved by the city council December twenty sixty because of a clerical error\nBut the sixty one K. represent the spike of twenty nine percent over his base salary of two hundred and ten thousand dollars and it was given to the chief annually because he took an eighty hour two week long course\nTo the commission of peace officer standards in training and I guess what there's a provision to bone is uh the chief for professional advancement professional enhancement what the justification for it if they felt it was necessary for him to take this two week course why isn't that just part of his duties\n[noise] yeah that's exactly right because it's other people's money is actually the worst thing to try that one thousand dollar though there\nIsn't a ... it's an assistant to a salary each and every year I'm so it kind of like saying if I'm hiring a commercial a truck driver and they show up and we only have a driver's license let me give you sixty thousand dollar bonus\nAbsurd it's obviously part of the job that you\nKnow the fact that someone can access sixty one thousand dollars or why for taking a two week course and by the way\nThat it paid for by Englewood residence where the money and earning thirty thousand dollars I don't know how anybody gets by and California making thirty thousand dollars let alone half of the population of ... so that's\nWhat really gets me going and stuff like that to see it it's actually the biggest access at ten sitcom and the smaller cities in the worst cities for whatever reason um maybe there's not as much watchdog groups going on down there I don't know what it is but it's to me that when it's a curse for the city council it's not their money but it's\nThe residents struggling to get by and thirty thousand dollars a year it's just an excuse all the way\nYou know he ... let me ask the philosophical question and we talked to John Cox gum candidate for governor about this and we bring this up\nWhen we have folks on board a ... we've been doing talk radio hearing KBC since Nineteen sixty one and ... and we've been complaining\nAbout a profligate spending from local politicians since Nineteen sixty two [laughter] haven't been doing a long time\nAnd yet it never seems to change it\nNothing happens the politicians who are so free with the money on other people's money or keep getting elected and if they're termed out then they're chiefs of staff or their hand picked successor stores\nUh Jose weeds are the guy who said I take full responsibility after plowing his city vehicle into a a a car stopped at a traffic light one in the morning and then took the breathalyzer test an hour and a half later\nAh he says he took us to take full responsibility for it but uh the city general fund wrote a check for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to make the case go away I'll take full responsibility for World War two if someone else will pay for [laughter] so you know the thing is this idea that there's other people's money or government money\nOr is the problem is you know everybody likes the idea we want the cops and firefighters we want teachers and sanitation workers to be well paid they deserve to have a middle class life and not to have to worry about how they're going to make ends meet their providing an incredibly important and valuable service\nBut you can't bankrupt the city in the process and nobody seems to care\nThat's the problem nobody seems to care the same people who'll ward these on sustainable deals and don't fund the pensions get reelected and reelected in ...\nRight I mean and that's exactly right um and I mean I Would argue that kind of\nWhat the American system of government tried to fix a if you look at things like our constitution which was\nVery cognizant of this fat and understanding that government will continue for overtime so you try and restricted as much as possible um to me\nThe biggest reason for the explosion I'm giving mandatory monopolistic powers to government which you know if you if you look back\nEven the biggest champions of unions even to the head of the AFL CIO in the fifties set of course you can't have\nGovernment a union and the government sector they're not there is no giving take like in the private sector where you have an employer when they gave a concession to root for wages coming out of their pockets have this back and for the government it's other people's money the costs are being born by the public at large and they usually won't show up for years later by a coin which\nDuring a six or seven foot surgically analytic oil but of course that's what we're also obviously there are about water in addition to win\nAnd
