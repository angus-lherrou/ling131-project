Fifteen thankfully an\nLadies and gentleman earthquakes no fun\nUh but the promise of an earthquake early warning system is becoming a reality bought a we're kind of in the infant stages of it and unfortunately\nThat also present some challenges because we can get either false alarms or\nA large that I'm a turn out to be real but with minor earthquakes and then it can ... people to future warnings when they become serious let's talk about this with the U.S Geological Survey scientist Robert to groups good morning Mr the growth how are you\nNear morning thank you for joining us or we appreciate it so this is of course amazing technology and we've seen early warning systems actually help save lives already in places like Japan and Mexico but there are some concerns about how people respond to these going forward\nThat's absolutely true and we're spending a lot of time with our scientists but also a big group of social scientists working with the shake alert program to figure out the best messaging and if whatever kind of alert has issued what kind of follow up messaging happens after the event or the non event so that\nPeople don't lose confidence in the system\nWell you know all of this we became illustrated rather dramatically with that ah that missile warning in Hawaii now ah earlier this year and then with the presidential warning or a task that came from\nA Washington just a couple of weeks ago to everybody's cellphone allegedly a theoretically\nThe the concern the upside is yes this is amazing technology that allows us to give people a heads up even thirty seconds can make a huge difference when it comes to a major earthquake but the downside is that people become numb to these things they don't take it seriously and then you end up like in these hurricanes where the people decided to quote unquote ride them out\n[noise] yes that's always a concern but it was the ... system we want to minimize and this is why we spent so much time to shake let's just in itself that the detection of the earthquakes and the decisions to make the alerts themselves are\nThat part of the system is really really well prepared the other side of it isn't the delivery side that's where we're having a lot of challenges because the communications infrastructure in our country wasn't developed to deliver a message\nAt earthquake early warning speed so we're trying to work those things out and with regard to the number of alerts that maybe\nWas people call them false alerts Ernest alerts um we want to minimize those\nTo avoid the sorts of things that you're talking about and you know the other part of it is of course is that you know if we don't have enough alerts people forget what the system is all about and that's when I see all the time with amber alerts sometimes you know here's something for months and months and months\nSay well what is that going on in my in my ... in my purse or my backpack [noise]\nUm what how far away are we is it how far away are wait until we have a an early warning system that can give you know a a real heads up I mean rather than seconds but maybe you know even ten minutes\nSo that's that's one of the big challenges with earthquakes is first of all we can't predict them we can only know an earthquake is happening if we detected on the surface of the arts so the challenges of course is getting that information

the strongest when events we've seen in years that NBC for forecasters shed a a men's viola\nAnd it looks like the strongest winds will move through a this morning on this afternoon so it should be a lot quieter today but a very very tough day yesterday and it was a tough day for the Dodgers in game three at Chavez Ravine\nThe Dodgers are now down a two games to one game for is a this evening\nAt six thirty and game five of course we'll be Wednesday and I think that's an afternoon get like a two something start like a getaway game a\nAnd it will be a getaway game for good if\nA if Milwaukee runs the table the Dodgers play golf will have to do it the tough way they're going to have to go back to Milwaukee now last night's loss\nWas not when you go into us again a game three in the series is tied one once somebody's going to be ahead yeah right so it's going to be had to one so I I I Am sure if every member of the Los Angeles Dodgers the last person is going to tell you\nIt's not panic time we certainly a cable coming back and winning a and they are\nUh bought it last night was an impressive win for Milwaukee they basically dominated the game until a Jeffers came in and\nMines and had a couple of hiccups and then you know managed to work its way out of it anyway with a couple of strike outs and the game\nAnd uh the uh brewer's now have a two one lead and basically the story of the game is a easily summed up with a fourteen strike outs in ten men in scoring position zero heads and zero when you're old for ten with runners and scarring position\nIt's very hard to win anything yeah at this level that going to win a game if you're a ... yeah yeah it's real so you pretty much have to score otherwise the best you can also forced to keep playing right if you ... and nothing nothing yeah exactly but\nThat the ... the other incident is the the the continued rather shocking\nA well and you know it's not shocking yes money ground though the Dodgers catcher is not a good catch your empathy he never been a good catch now he's a good sense of ... home runs he actually had a better season significantly better season than the Yankees uh Gary Sanchez who's also not a good catch her\nBut he had twenty four home runs a Gary Sanchez the Yankees at Eighteen and he was injured a lot of the year granted but uh but uh yeah I Would hate him considerably whether to forty batting average and for a defensive position who he was a big contributor to the Dodgers off ...\nThe problem is it is a fundamentally catching as a defensive ... I mean my ah\nMy my ... was an outlier Johnny Bench was an outlier there's been a handful of really great ah rates of calories yeah yadda year Molina who's on first ballot hall of famer started out as a great defensive catcher and then actually turned into a really good ... a boom which is why he's going to the hall of fame\nBut ground now or is not a good defensive catcher and the thing about the post season and it's universally true what ever weakness your team has gets exposed in the postseason\nWhatever it is it shows up a and for the Dodgers their problem is the same as the Yankees they're often says constructed to live on home runs and walks yeah you you you take a lot of pitches take your lungs and get two guys on hit a three run Homer\nBut the walks only work if you hit home runs in that scenario if you can't play small bomb those guys over half guy stealing putting pressure on the pictures then it's not going to work well right and ...\n... if you don't strike out way strike by ten times as likely and now we're out on base last night with a lot but it it it doesn't matter if you can't get guys home right\nAs you got to make contact for us to exactly have to take them fat off your shoulder well\n... and above and beyond that they ran into really good pinion urging last night I was actually\nThinking that we also have to find a way to scratch across run or do some uh they don't they don't got no they don't go to the way we saw and that's the way that we saw a Boston do it against the Yankees they played a hit and run Alex ... had the red Sox playing small ball Houston does it\nMilwaukee had it but the Dodgers don't play that way and the Yankees don't play that way the Yankees are now playing golf\nSo it's too late in the game now you're not going to change and now what do they have won the national league was six times with is that when the game seven in the world series playing this way and look\nIf they are geo Gonzales is starting tonight for the uh of for the brewers\nAnd uh he's beat of all yeah eminently beat of oil and we'll say only going to go two or three in and probably you know they only let them go what three and a two innings ... yeah I don't expect who's going to go much more on their own ... so anyway we'll see what happens is starts at six thirty tonight\nOr just a heads up two ladies and gentleman we are supposed to have at the top of the next hour\nA Kevin deli on candidate for the United States Senate Democrat running against Dianne Feinstein and in the top of the nine o'clock hour Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox will be in Studio with us and we're looking forward to that and yet as well one hour from now at seven Fifteen color five and get a pair of tickets to see foreigner\nDouble vision that in our original members including Lou Graham joined Mick Jones and the current lineup into complete set celebrating the ... anniversary of double vision at the Microsoft Theater November ninth\nTickets on sale now so uh this is furnished by golden voice one hour for now you have a chance to win those tickets\nAre mentioned at the top of this hour that uh Paul Allen has died at the age of sixty five Paul Allen\nIs the cofounder of Microsoft with Bill gates back in Nineteen Seventy five and he actually left the company in Nineteen eighty eighty two after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease he said in the board until two thousand\nBut uh he was only there in the very beginning but that was still enough to launch a revolution in technology and society\nAnd of course a vast fortune he owned the Portland TrailBlazers and the Seattle Seahawks franchises gave away millions and millions and millions of dollars are Jim robust anybody to talk about the life and career of Paul Allen good morning Mr rupe\nGood how are you you know him\nVery well thank you you know he was quite a guy in many respects and uh I think he touched every segment of arts and sciences not only was he was brilliant mind\nThat even Bill Gates says personal computing wouldn't be without Paul Allen but it was a an accomplished a musician he he jammed with the likes of Mick Jagger and von ... is his personal heroes Jimi Hendrix\nThat museum he has called the experience music project in Seattle there's a whole room dedicate adjust to Jimmy hendrix so and then you know he was into conservation a ... you know all kinds of thriller\nYou it was a very big oceanographer and uh you know famously built a cutting edge yachts and also sea exploration for instance his ah\nResearch vessel found the wreck of the USS Lexington that was sank in the battle of coral sea world while I may not happen this year by the way uh uh yeah so it has all kinds of fascinating things\nReally and and and even though he was first diagnosed he left Microsoft back in eighty to eighty three when he was first diagnosed with cancer he beat it back then I think he was treated again in two thousand nine\nBut all the while the the currency of Microsoft I'm a ... year and a deli said that all this time Paul Allen would continue to contribute you know other ideas or processes\nUm throughout this entire time of Microsoft so he he will be sorely missed in many ways and and it's it's it's interesting to Steve Jobs died so young\nUh in in Paul Allen who died of just the age of sixty five you wonder with all that he has contributed and all the research that is funded for artificial intelligence and the new frontier technologies you you're kind of wonder what else would have come from that mind headed been allowed to be around for a little while longer\nThat's it you know he just it was just a brilliant\nMan in twenty twenty or twenty fourteen he pledged at least a hundred million dollars to help fight the Ebola virus and twenty Seventeen he gave thirty million dollars to how Seattle's homeless\nOr he gave over two billion dollars to various charities\nOr he also founded several organizations including the space transportation company straddle launch the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence and other ... Allen Institute that another at Allen Institute that focuses on bio science Vulcan which he founded managed his business and philanthropic interest\nA plus the sports I mean ... in one life\nOr he was able to make major strides in so many different areas now obviously you have the resources but he also had the interest in that capacity to do it\nOne of the things that Bill Gates said and this is sort of like a bumper sticker that would underscore who Paul Allen is are following was\nUh he he was fond of saying according to Bill Gates that if it has the potential to do good than we should do it I mean that is that that's the mind that's the\nKind of person that Paul Allen was he did a lot of good I think at the expense of his of his self I ... ... you know we're talking about here um with your screener and she said you know he didn't have a family never watched it and have kids you just kind of served too\nFinally Sunday Morning it's a ten K. starts in front of city hall and then I ended up in Grant Park\nAbout halfway are out there and we get to the k._b._c. booth and it's really a good time so if you are interested or you can make a contribution by the way go to ... dot com and a sign of getting information a hike come walk with this or that this Sunday the annual aids walk out like\nAll right ladies and gentleman uh it's interesting how on the campaign to remember when the Occupy Wall Street movement was going on after the market meltdown and God Knows there were plenty of reasons to be critical of Wall Street and there still are bought one of the uh ...\nYou know sort of hobby horse pieces of rhetoric that you hear usually from the left is that the rich don't pay their fair share and it's you know it's a compounded when you get stories like Jared Kushner doesn't appear to have paid any income taxes for a number of years eccentric center and you see those stories of course\nThat's that's always complex because you know when you get into that level of income the uh the the\nBusiness losses versus business expenses versus incoming primary ... own corporations get out of paying ... they don't pay anything well yeah well here's some new numbers this is from Bloomberg individual income taxes or the federal government's single biggest revenue source\nIn fiscal year twenty Eighteen which ended September thirtieth individual income tax is expected to bring in roughly one point seven trillion about half of all federal revenue according to the congressional budget office and in his past the ... can offer any guidance\nIn twenty six team one point for four trillion income taxes were paid by one hundred and forty point nine million taxpayers reporting a total of ten point two trillion adjusted gross income\nUh so what we're finding out now is that the top three percent of us taxpayers paid almost all of the income taxes and twenty sixteen to talk about this and more it's a pleasure to welcome back to the show the president or how would you aren't as taxpayers association junk about John how are ya\nI'm well Doug how're you doing I find you then you sometimes feel like we've got you on speed dial\n[laughter] and that's fine that's fine because the more education the better and I think your point is a good one this is a man that's been out\nThere for a long time that the rich are paying their fair share I Do think the rich are more adept because of their access to attorneys and CPA\nWho's ... exploiting the system correct\nBut as a general proposition\nIt is the the the wealthy pay an ordinance a percentage\nOf the income tax far in excess of what would be a flat rate I think everybody would agree like under a flat rate tax everybody pays a dollar or whatever every hundred dollars so you make a lot you're paid that much more the problem in in the United states and particularly in California I'd like to talk about California in ...\nOf an Ninety Ninety ABC\n[noise]\nOn a Tuesday Morning six the day of October by the way rebuilding and a devastating aftermath of hurricane Michael is obviously going to be\nCostly to say the least on the show the pictures President Trump and the first lady Melania Trump were down there in Florida yesterday\nYou can help to give to the red cross hurricane Michael relief on takes the word Michael to nine zero nine nine nine or go to Kay B.

an uphill battle in the primary uh she won handily but the Democratic California state Democratic Party endorsed you why do you think they did that\nI think it was because of the values I can say this if you remember opening up your um your June fifth primary\nBallot that were thirty two names on that ballot it looked like the white pages name after name after named after a name or frankly I think it was the last page in quite a few of the ballots and if you really didn't know me there was really nobody is a free to vote for me and when you have Ninety five percent name recognition sort of like

have the biggest disagreement or I Am emphatically pro immigration and pro immigrant but I Do believe that we have to be a nation of laws and it has to be a legal immigration system because\nI you
