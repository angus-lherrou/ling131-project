ladies and gentlemen you may have seen this in the LA Times David Lazarus his column at the FCC has slapped a huge fine on a telemarketer caught spoofing now\nI Can't tell you how many phone calls I get like that\nHere's the problem I don't know what spoofing is I don't know what doc seeing is I don't know moving and I don't know what ...\nAnd there's so many of these terms that show up but you know who knows what spoofing is David Lazarus he's with us right now to David how are you\nGood morning I'm good thanks what the hell is spoofing it's not a little ... let me start\nRe trying not outlets mall right on okay I\nHave tried to keep this on a higher plane than this spring\nChicken thing is really insidious and I bet you everybody listening to this has had an audience of it it's something that\nTelemarketers use and it's a way of getting around your caller i._d. system by having a bogus number appear on the caller i._d. screen\nNow sometimes it might be something like you know your local police department or a local hospital or your local school something that that has an or of trust around it\nBut the technology has been improving to the point now or telemarketers are able to move all the numbers in your area maybe even your neighbors are people you know and so that number comes up on the screen you think oh it's George I'm Glad it's I I haven't talked to them in a while and you pick up the phone and it's not them it's some telemarketer\nAnd so it completely makes the caller i._d. system useless\nNow I I of course we've experienced this to where like the first three digits of our home phone number shows up with some of the numbers and well that must be in the neighborhood\nBut here's the question I have cars weekend a lot of these calls it the house\nAnd the most of them are our ... our boss so which by the way as another term that no one knows what the hell we're talking about Twenty years ago\nBut uh the phone rings you answer it ego hello and then you hear that sort of click and there's it's total silence and I'll Wait I'm Out until uh they hang up till the machine hangs up\nWhat benefit is there to these telemarketers by just I mean I I'm trying to figure out we're who knows how are they making any money from any of this to keep this operation go who's staying on the phone to give them their Social Security number\n[laughter] really enough people that it's worthwhile for them unfortunately many seniors get duped by these sorts of things you know there are folks who got lots of time on their hands they might be a little bit lonely and they don't get a lot of calls and so the phone rings and it's kind of an exciting thing it's a shame\nTo things happen when you're picking up a call like this either it's going to commit to an automated system which might take a moment for it to kick into gear\nBecause first you know it it has to go from the you're on the line and the system starts up and then it's going to lead you down some track that probably\nIs going to lead you to press one and then you're going to talk to a live person or a live person coming right out of the gate but let's face it they don't have enough live people in their call center so again you're going to get that pause as the system waits for one of their operators to say oh we gotta live one on the line\nAnd then they pick up and that's what's going on with that cause\nUh we're talking about David Lazarus whose piece appeared in the business section of the LA Times FCC slaps a huge fun on telemarketing scored spoofing but the industry still needs to step up All right the fine thirty seven point five million that's a pretty big fine I'm sure there'll be knocked down a bit\nBut ah what I\nMean what should the government to be doing I saw a

eleven and Sunday night at ten per champions of just [noise] you're on TALK radio seven Ninety ABC [noise]\n\nABC [noise]\nMarty O'Malley to ensure that still rocking out without bandage ladies and gentleman a you know that song starts\nTo lose it sounds like to the loo\nAnd that's a perfect segue to this segment in San Francisco there's a new\nApp cold snap crap oh not Snapchat up crap\nThat way you can take pictures of public poop ing ... says to help the city\nIt's a much more interactive poke your mom do as well as a girl that came on our show a few months ago that a whole different way to move now now\nMore and more hours to come back\nYou could be a thousand dollars richer books not enough to buy your children's love\nPuzzled by yourself fear to not\nGetting a\nShot at a grand is coming up in just seconds so even hear\nK babies the Los Angeles county of cumulus station\nThe bottom line is hurricane season tornadoes that every year if you live in a place where that happens that's every stinking yeah\nAnd multiple times a year or they're like get up and leave take everything with your house and take your animal than evacuate and by the way and when you come back your house may be underwater yeah and like uninhabitable for a year and a half so I get a hold of topics covered with water so I I don't know\nYou know it's just ...\nIt's it's this is an absolute truism the pretty or the place the more dangerous the weather\nBecause it's the it's the tectonic plates it's the hurricanes it's the it's the power of the ocean whatever it is the storms of what shape is what makes it makes a dramatic\nA show there's no escaping it but uh we get off pretty easy day in day out here until of course we have the big one on the San Andreas fault of the Newport Englewood and then we'll all be saying\nWhat are we forgot again\nLadies and gentleman a here's one of the reasons we live here in Los Angeles becoming one of the sports capitals of the universe and are these are great\nDays to be a sports fan in Los Angeles you've got\nTwo football teams both of which are good despite a why we have the charges were not really sure but they're pretty good but the rams are very good friends and he has a college football can be a little better but the Lakers have the greatest player of his generation and one of the all time\nGreatest players in the history of the game on the roster and those games actually start counting next week and ah the angels have a arguably the most exciting and certainly ... best all around single player in the game in my trout\nAnd the Dodgers for the sixth consecutive time one the western division and now and Vance or to the pennant round to play the Milwaukee Brewers because yesterday\nOr many Machado led the Dodgers to finish off the Braves in in L. D. S. with a six to win a shadow hitting the big home run\nA and the uh the pitching was good enough to shut down the Braves including herself one of the vestiges of our generation here he is he is and will be starting game one on friday in Milwaukee Milwaukee's a tough\nA opponent for the Dodgers they're better than Atlanta and they're better than Colorado yeah but\nThe Dodgers starting pitching and ... and line up certainly the lineup is as good as anybody's line up and their starting pitching is better than Milwaukee's Milwaukee probably has a better bullpen and the Dodgers but that's about it\nAnd hopefully build or got passed this playoff generates\nWell that's where I think Dave Roberts uh made a very wise managerial decision in that game and Atlanta a game three when viewer gave up five runs in the second\nInning and they didn't pull them and they didn't stuck with them they didn't leave 'em out uh pull them out of the game so he just marinate sin failure\nA and gets the hips pitching in post game a competition instead he actually fought his way through it and at one point retired ten ten in a row after that and that's something that you really build them as a young a picture so that was a smart move I think it's going to pay a big dividend so anyway\nFriday it begins in Milwaukee Dodgers brewers meanwhile the Yankees Red Sox well the only ones still playing\nA left and they will go again tonight in game for the red Sox are up to one after shellacking the Yankees in the Bronx sixteen to one the ninth inning they ended up with Austin roam on the Yankees had their backup catcher pitching in a post season game\nGave up a home run to a ... a who hit for the cycle the first player in the history of baseball going back to Nineteen oh three in postseason baseball he's the first guy ever to hit for the cycle it'll proceed\nWay heart is the head for the cycle period I think there's more perfect games and guys like me and it's hard to do period and then to do it in the ... and to do it during the ... a Yankees Red Sox game\nWell what we now know this is the second time he said for the cycle in his career which is unusual unusual to a a what a you know the fact that he hit the homerun off of the backup catcher\nA ... I'm sure that uh like the\nKind that it does it does yeah yes it's a it's in the record so anyway I was like ... I don't think the Yankees will care about what happened last night that's sixteen the one that was one of those days they just they've already forgotten\nIt but you know at the red Sox and that's what you get for walking out and play in New York New\nYork I'm sure they did like judge you want to like\nAaron ... Frank Sinatra again yeah\nDon't play it here in the ... language or you'd think somebody would write a better song about Boston than a\nWhy there's I'm shipping out to Boston now any more or you need a more iconic song but you also don't have any good Cleveland songs and uh\nThey're out to yeah Cleveland data they ran into the bus so that is the Houston Astros and everybody is forgetting the Houston Astros is defending world champs and they're really really good\nSo it's ... it's great it's great time of year everybody's playing every sport if you're a sports fan this time of year and this is the city to be him All right ladies you by the way the rest of the country\nOr the rest of the country sees Southern California and specifically Los Angeles as\nA entertainment either show business traditional showbiz or sports and they don't see anything else coming out of here that's why they got like ESPN Zone and they've all got a Hollywood bureaus to cover they don't they there's such a bias from basically Atlanta\nWhere CNN headquarters are is based uh through Boston it's that whole I Ninety five Northeast Corridor where they think that anything that's important that happens happens there yeah they couldn't be more wrong I mean important things obviously do happen there\nBut important things happening out here too they just don't pay any attention to it and there's three hour time difference things are happening here well they're asleep\nSo they don't pay any attention to it they're really up to ...

huh\n... in less you specifically tell them I don't want to be registered to vote now they don't if you don't designate a party that you are designated as a decline to state an independent voter\nBut

you're\nA a a foreign national if you're an illegal immigrant for instance in getting one of those California driver's license those are guilty of the deal or driver's licenses you wouldn't be able to

is on when you get to a throws a party with someone else's money\nAnd that money is your money and as we've said many times on this program if we could expunged one phrase from the media and from the vocabulary from the lexicon or it would be government money now the government's going to pay for it because there is no such thing everything is paid for by\nThe people and it's amazing how many people don't understand that concept I think well somebody else going to pay for it now politicians do engage in a lot of divide and conquer where they'll make some people pay for some things\nUh that a benefit everybody a or a specific people ... and that's always popular like if you can tax the rich well that's very popular because there aren't many there are middle class and poor\nUh but uh that's what was so odd about the sales tax a temporary sales tax it became a permanent ... says 'cause the sales tax impacts everybody\nBut nonetheless these are the obvious taxes income taxes property taxes sales taxes are hardly the only taxes that we pay and there's a whole host of new ones headed for us\nA ... election day because there are a ballot measures not just the big ones like

on election day\nIt's really depressing catch your ballot and there's never enough money and they're always asking for money for the same things over and over we just passed water bonds and the same the same thing is on the ballot we passion in June it's on the ballot again\nDouble the amount in November\nAnd why is this if you look at if you look at the state budget\nTo see what they're really spending the money on it's not really what they say they're spending money on as we've all heard every time there's a tax cut on the ballot or if there is a tax increase on the ballot all the public officials are saying well if we don't get this money it's going to mean no police\nNo schools no firefighters no water no rescue helicopter you're all going to fall into a pothole and die\nThe talk radio seven id Kate ABC\nLocal until ten o'clock\nEight hundred to two two Kate ABC\nIs the number or the planet only has until twenty thirty which is not that long or not that far in the future twelve years basically\nTo stem catastrophic climate change according to a a whole panel of government experts governments around the world must take rapid far reaching an unprecedented changes at all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming\nA this report was issued Monday by the un inter governmental panel on climate change\nAs soon as the planet will reach the crucial fresh all the one point five degrees Celsius to point seven degrees Fahrenheit above pre industrial levels but as early as twenty thirty participating a precipitating excuse me the risk of extreme drought wildfires floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people\nThe date which falls well within the lifetime of many people alive today is based on the current levels of greenhouse gas emissions\nOr the planet has already two thirds of the ways there was global temperatures have warmed about one degree Celsius according or avoiding going higher even higher will require significant action in the next few years so\nNow I mentioned this before this is a good scary number twenty thirty 'cause it's only twelve years in the future right after the Olympics you see where we made mistakes in the past with like Jerry Brown would talk about a hundred years LAX will be underwater and blah blah blah blah blah and even\nYeah even though I have enough trouble worrying about next Tuesday views closed numbers Al Gore and that stupid movies that are twenty Seventeen Florida will be underwater right\nIt was so you've got to pick a nice ... you got to pick a number that's far enough away that nobody will actually remember\nYour predicts yeah close enough that when you make the production it scares where does this our doomsday number and what are they calling this uh this is well it's a catastrophic climate change so I'd have to do that the twenty thirty are gonna have to calculate that yeah you have to start counting down the countdown clock only three thousand seven Ninety Days till we all die\nAnd now with that\nUh with that said that could be right uh and that you know that so it was like two thousand member they were counting down to the world is going to end right well let's do it in ... right but that that shouldn't paralyze us from taking action to\nWell you must have colonize Mars by twenty thirty right well let's\nLet's hope so let's ah so you know the bottom line is a\nKnow the whole ... you know the politics of climate change is tough to hack your way through\nBecause you know there were there's no question in my mind that some of the basically the communists who want to control private property\nRealize that if they try to control people they stand in front of tanks in Tiananmen Square but if they speak on behalf of old growth forest and spotted owls who's to say that the spotted owls don't uh have a different opinion right\nSo there's some of that going on but there's also no question that we've done stupid things that have hurt the earth and we're smarter about a lot of things you mentioned many many times Pittsburgh was a ... a hundred years ago was described as hell with the lid off\nAnd it snowed black in Pittsburgh yeah coal dust yeah All right we don't do that anymore we can do things that are smarter maybe we shouldn't be doing things like for instance building joining condominium complex is through a marshes\nSo that you can have a boat dock where it used to be wet lands that act as a thermostat when hurricanes come ashore and robbed the hurricanes of a lot of their strength and they don't destroy a whole bunch of people's homes and kill people there's just commonsense things that we can do\nThat does and and if you supported it doesn't mean that you're a you know ah that that you're a

think what's typical there's there was historically a lot of selection pressure in other words if you know years and years ago if\nYou didn't run you know that fat you probably got eaten by some type of other animal by um and and now\nYou know it's it's very different and we are um you know there are a whole number of different genes which may be in the past wouldn't have been happy to get it I think we don't you know we don't know ah we don't know the answer is if I had to guess I Would suspect you know more obesity and environmental\nBut I Do think where men in particular are a lot more

oceans and how the fishy the plastic and then we the fish and we're bringing chemicals into our systems at and and that's just one example ... you know I I I'm I always go back to\nA an example from history of where a breakthrough in one area has an unintended consequences that we don't anticipate and there was the famous Franklin Expedition in Eighteen fifty to find the northwest passage\nAnd one of the problems that polar explorers always had was they'd get a you know serving they suffer from malnutrition because they were ice bound in these long journeys him when they learned how to can\nUh fruits and vegetables they thought this is gonna be the solution will have the fruits and vegetables that will help protect us against curvy et cetera but what happened was the early canning process they seal the cans with lead\nAnd they all died from lead poisoning and they went crazy and kill each other and they thought they would solving a problem and now this is a long winded way of bringing up things like ... cook Ware and all the plastics in the bottles that we drink from for soda and water bottles and all of these other things that we've introduced in the first world\nThat obviously we didn't introduce them with the knowledge or intent that they would have these residual effects but how much of an impact you think just the modern lifestyle\nCan have on these things\nYeah I mean I Do think anything significant I mean there's you know some work that's been done a lot of Denmark which basically shows that\nUm rates have been fertility are going up rates of testicular cancer and rates of sort of um children born with general uh abnormalities are also going up and there there is some data suggests that that is due to these um\nEnvironmental exposures\n... and I do think our our modern lifestyle is is having\nA fact I mean even people who are\nUm you know the most you know careful and sort of touchy ... and health conscious I mean we interact with that stuff all the time um you know and there is some data that even like you know handling receipt paper you know you can pick up something called BPA which can be\nYou know that's really production but the reality is we're in contact with all the time and a lot of these things are really hard you know you can study them and in animal models but it's very hard to study the sort of things in a in people\nGot it well listen thank you so much for talking to us about it it's a it's a fascinating area of study Dr Jim a hotel ing appreciate it sir the co author of this study ah ladies and\nGentlemen we have breaking news you know on ABC\nI yes CNN is reporting that Nikki Haley has resigned\nAs US ambassador and pass it or to the United nations now on line they are saying that a watchdog once an investigation of Nikki Haley's private jet use\nA federal government watchdog has asked the state department on Monday to investigate whether UN ambassador Nikki Haley has broke any regulations by accepting seven flights on private jets from three South Carolina executives last year\nThis is an amazing turn of events Nikki Haley a was a by many in a GOP considered to be a potential presidential candidate right and she would be yeah so far President Trump has accepted the resignation and there will be an official announcement from the White House at seven thirty\nAnd it's going to be fascinating to see if she's resigning because of a financial impropriety she's damaged her brand or possibly irreparably well it says here she just she did\nNot disclose the full amount on this disclosure she's supposed to say she said it was a lot in the valuation of the flights that she took privately were a lot less than what she said of discloses what that is watchdog group was saying she was saying they were personal friends and she should have\nA the watchdog group saying that they should have been value that a lot more that you know\nIt doesn't mean a lot better but it's an editor resign and preempt an overnight I mean it it's at the point is the is that your and your position as ambassador to get these free flights of private jets and and Alison you\nKnow this was the same thing Bob Menendez the senator from New Jersey nearly got impeached in prisons\nAre for doing the same thing while I had a friend and he happened to make the scanning machines that

bother me if it went away but I've made no study as to what the impact will be why do you post Rob seven\nWell first of all yeah everyone hates the time changes particularly the spring forward when we lose an hour of sleep but I think people don't appreciate that having daylight saving time all the all year round wouldn't sell cause a lot of problems first of all\nIn the winter we got about ten hours of light and in the summer we get about fourteen hours of life that's not going to change with anything we do a so if we only have ten hours of light in the winter\nOr the question is when we ... we're in we're going to have that light if we go to the daylight saving time year round it won't the son won't actually come up in Los Angeles to about eight in the morning that means a lot of kids are going to be going to school in the dark a lot of people are gonna be leaving for work in the dark\nAnd that in itself is going to cause a lot of problems or people have talked about the potential medical issues heart attacks\nAnd so forth that go up particularly on the spring forward day when we change our clocks but year round we would have or at least in the winter we would have more accidents in the morning when people are going to work and going to school in the dark\nIt's not that ah it it's a clear when the real problem is there's just a slight during the winter and we got to figure out when we're going to use it\nWell but that the the idea of kids standing around waiting for a school bus in the dark is probably not going to be real attractive to a parents no\nNo but I think the other issue is that people are do want to change their schedules in the winter or they want to\nThe Labor Department reported on Friday President Trump quickly of course spike the
