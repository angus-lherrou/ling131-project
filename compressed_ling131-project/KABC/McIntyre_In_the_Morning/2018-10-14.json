worried at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nUh some some a haiku you know a gang symbol almost you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords a store don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\n... what was your a second grade teacher is middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's why I Hope\nTo choose to verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password ... it's been six months they used it\nBut if I have an a Yahoo apple on my phone they send me a message through the ... and I can get in yeah and that's really good off yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we always get people who complain and go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nI'm going to tell you something now my space in linked him yes they bowls since two thousand sixteen if I'm a huge security breach or you know in their website ... can you guess in the category of brands one\nOr two of the most popular ... passwords that

any if you could recommend a website or a resource that function or something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nIs that's part of it yeah or I I end up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer that said\nHere's what I did at grandma's house on Tuesday surf act\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in touch it ended up being thirty five pages long about ... used to sixty photos but there was a short it was really hard you know what I thought that there are publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nAh there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten grapes photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest\nAbout what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew or you use a particular site to put together a photo but did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and 'cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word may called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know no charge\nAnd so you so before you lived for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay uh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo science will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word and trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicate back and forth on fiber they ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called five her but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or\nMe a note through the website and I know that sounds crazy and and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website and I've got a sister\nIn the years and when you send me your question things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content\nAt for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call it give us a call to the show and if you're a Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join comes club right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the Kim commando show [noise]\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on line intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have the freedom to be anonymous and untraceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it and I recommend F secure freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they have the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nF secure eat unless you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required you can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online\nOr to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount ... camp visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's eh stash secure dot com slash camp\nDr Peter feels as both an empty and a chiropractor and is an expert in regenerative orthopedics it's a pleasure to welcome him to KBC thanks Doug stem cell therapy a non surgical alternative to join replacement absolutely\nStem cell therapy helps people avoid total drunk replacements and the complications that are associated with it at Arthur region will use the gold standard for stem cell therapy we take stem cells from your bone marrow in fat as well as platelets from your blood to help grow new cartilage in your knee hip or shoulder\nWe also treat the outside of your joints so the entire joined his repaired and can function well again in addition stem cells can repair backs and next if you have been told that you have bone on bone no more cartilage or need your joint replaced and stem cell therapy might be for you remember one surgery is done it can never be on done\nIf you want to avoid surgery on your joints spy called Dr fields of three one oh four or five three one two three four that's three one oh four or five three one two three four and on the Web at Dr fields dot com that's DR fields doc talk\nABC [noise]\nThey are the worst thing shes and brought to buy be prepared dot com slash cam you're one step solution for emergency food water gear and\nResources then be prepared dot com slash Kim it'd be ready for anything once again that the prepared dot com slash Ken [noise] All right there about nine million Web cams and security camps that are just wide open to attack and I want you to make sure that yours is not on the list a there's a company called shy among guy\nThat's the that's the company who makes all these Web devices and security cameras but guess what\nThat's not going to be the name on the Web cam or their security can't because they make tons of Web cams for all kinds of companies but basically what's happening is that these Web cams and security cams are so accessible that if you change in the fall pass where\nSomebody can still break in and if in case you want to see if your webcam security cameras on the list it over to commanded outcome of course that K.

thought would be like well with me the best ... that I can find for small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it those old or a I'm a software that you can purchase and then the the F yelled at search engine optimization ethical with oil all ...\nAll right well let's talk a little bit so so what's going on with your business on line\n[noise] well the problem with some of it\nIs obviously what most of us have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out right with the battery balance it out but I'll be if they do the work that way you know the people who have experience it's usually doesn't go online and post there the\nPositive experiences with you at your business so what happened here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses so what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business along\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management firm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay\nBecause as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too is that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\nBut and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp\nOr where where is it so I'm Glad for all the medical\n... grade the car okay all leading the except to\nGet so get you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card\nFrom the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client and tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay\nBecause I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for\nYou know if they had a great time they're happy to do that and you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they you know can you help on\nLine and just drop some rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the\n... the other thing you can get let me finish the other thing you can do is with health grades\nIs drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it and\nWhat I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program\nCalled recognize Dr status\nThat'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore so\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service so that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay\nAnd to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars what would you at the top of the Google Search results\nYou present would to consider when considering home security than I Do these aren't as wars

I'm a ... in West Virginia I'll I'll give you a perfect example in West Virginia we have a historically been what a coal state coal has been\nOur bread and butter the majority of of our history has been about polling coal out of the ground I when I graduated high school I Can't tell you how many friends went into the coal mines I went into a coma and I'll tell you all digress for a minute\nAnd I want you to tell me what he'll coal looks like is it like charcoal like make that call that you put in at a barbecue you are absolutely have to tell me that it's\nLike oh man you know when I was a kid I think I was probably the ... and my brothers and I was probably about ten years old the first time I went in the coal mine and I said to myself no way\nWas it scary but it it's our place in the world is your\nWell ... mile to two miles to three miles deep down inside of a mountain with no light in a cricket eat cracking the rats or the old elevator it is scary and I don't recommend it for ... anybody\nUm and being from West Virginia at that time it's sacrilegious to say anything of an even today it's sacrilegious to talk about cold and not being a professional and in West Virginia we have had to find a way because the coal industry through the Obama policies the coal industry was getting\nShut down the environmental protection agency was coming in and saying\nWe can't allow\nThese coal mines and coal mining companies to continue to pollute and to continue\nUm with their with their drilling a you really literally I'm not kidding you they're drilling in my backyard in West Virginia you know and and and annihilating found beautiful mountainsides\nThat have been there for hundreds of thousands of years they just go in and blow the ... out of it I mean they take out a total mountain they take out a ... and they go down into the mountain to dig out this cold and ah that has now changed over the course of time\nAnd a lot of West Virginians was not prepared for that change\nYou know and so it's been a hard transition for West Virginia but didn't they give a lot of people like black lung and kill them most of my neighbors growing up died of a block long I mean there was when I was growing up\nUh we had a great neighborhood of a retired men my my my neighborhood my street I grew up on a street with about ten houses on it\nTo a small town so they're maybe like ten or eleven\nHouses on my street and on my street as I was eight or nine years old most of the people on my street or around the same age as my parents they are all kind of came into the neighborhood at around the same time so they were all\nGenerally speaking within five to ten years of of a trip and we all knew each other in small town I mean everybody knows each other\nI was a ...

look down on that note I'll wrap it up\nOver time\nThat I Love I Love what can I say\nThose of you are out there you do not need to send me any mention of approaches\nUm so I Want to wrap this up just by saying we were talking about the sandwich generation\nI Want to talk about the fear of not knowing how your life will change over the course of the next ten Fifteen Twenty years so if you're fifty years old and you're listening to the show and let's say you'd make a decent living in LA our affordability index says it a hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars is what you need to make to be able to afford to live here\nAnd it's unfortunate that it is that high but let's just use the round\nEven numbers of a hundred grand of what it takes\nPost taxes to live in Los Angeles with a a spouse or a you know you\nYour spouse and the childcare right low low let alone if you've got two or three or brothers and sisters nephews and nieces decker if you're fifty\nAnd you're going to live another let's even say you know you're not going to be that person who is a hundred let's say you lived eighty chairs that's Thirty years at a hundred grand inflation adjusted you're looking at four and a half million dollars you're going to need and you're going to spend\nThat just to eighty that's just the eighty from fifty to eighty three and a half million dollars and weren't you saying that people are now living longer and they're they are they're living longer than the number of people living to a hundred is doubling every year and so\nLet's just even say you know it eighty your health starts to decline you have a heart attack you God Forbid you get some sort of disease cancer or whatever it may be and your life is not just cut short you know demanded the statistically speaking we don't have heart attacks any more and more people are dying the\nThe hard way the slow slog of hostile losing you know you're ... you're right it's just statistically speaking the majority of us are not going to just drop dead and so you're going to need money and so I'm telling you right now if you're fifty\nAnd you're not thinking about that three and a half million number you should\nYou really need to be prepared for it because if you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you are not saving forty thousand dollars of it which I can tell you right now the majority of you are not right I've got clients that are general managers of hotels I've got clients that are\nSmall business owners got clients that are working all over Los Angeles from Santa Barbara to San Diego\nAnd they make two hundred thousand and they spend two hundred and ten you know\nThat's all right um you know I've got clients with hundreds of thousands of dollars in credit card debt so I just want to read it or eight to our listeners if you're fifty at a minimum if you're making a hundred grand you're an educated individual you're making a hundred two hundred thousand or you're spending a hundred two hundred

the program good morning\nHi nice to talk to you on this is my first time calling I have are actually my dad um he's had to look at mercury grand marquee he bought the first one in Nineteen Seventy two which he\nCalled for Eighteen years now and the last one now that he bought a my parents bought in\nTwo thousand and he's eighty three so I you know I help take care of and then I tried them over you know places and I was learning a little bit about this because I I like to do weekend trips to just to target the and you know just get out of town for a couple of days sure and I was learning I learned over the years that um\nThis guy got only last forever but the mileage that you can you can drive on these is um from what I understand you know the police use the heat heat special ordered both of them but the bigger engine and and all the all the little bells and whistles and everything\nTo mercury grand marquee is one of my favorite road cars and let me explain why the mercury Markey is the same as the crown Victoria which how we've patrol has used and for years and years and it's the same body style is Lincoln town car\nSo it's all three cars built into one and they don't make the America or any more but all the part that is the most ... rear wheel drive vehicle it's mood is comfortable I Wish they still made that vehicle either isn't afford all the Lincoln line\nEverybody went right in front wheel drive and that's as you probably know it's just nice move large comfortable vehicle\nYes yes and so my question to you is on you know at first I really you know he said you know you can\nUse this for you it's you know taking trips and stuff so I think putting a little money into it it's in it's in good shape 'cause I remember he got it when he was retired right it's done a lot of local driving and I've done some longer trips to Vegas in different places uh\nTraveling but it's not um you know was it didn't go to a lot of heart or\nLike I said at a number one BMW motorcycle dealer in the usa just stop by and see the folks there that's a great great facility that BMW motorcycles\nAnd their website is be Long Beach Long Beach BMW motorcycles dot com or you can call them five six two four to six twelve hundred just telling one and only mode of man sent you\nStart to nine line 'cause I Know you don't want to miss a minute of our show every day\nI probably had a life and they want to\nDoor it's scheduled plow you\nCheck out our daily podcast ... on my eyes to Institute in unpaid movie that\nThe way they report the news on its face off of the funniest\nSeven Ninety Ninety gay ABC [noise]\nYeah uh those [noise]\n\nHey I'm excited about Tesla I Know our life is fair Tesla's been in the news\nA lot lately but I and I'm really excited I don't know why I got about ... totally there but Tesla's coming out with their own tequila\nTesla is coming out with their own tequila I Can't believe they're going into making booze now [noise] [laughter]\nYeah but it yeah that's true 'cause his cars and put it in auto Dr drink while you're driving is ... but he has got his own tequila coming out and made a one hundred percent I ... I Know a little bit about tequila and I can't wait to taste it just to see what it tastes like\nIn a anyway my hat's off to him because he's coming up with he never ceases to amaze all of us with all the things he's doing coming out with his own tequila wow\nIt pretty soon you'll have a tequila song coming out gay back to the phones were speaking with Richard Richard at white men airport good morning Richmond Richard and I'm\nQuite sure there are a spark plugs you know in the past we didn't after we played some about every ten thousand miles is do no\nUh it it still was a little too much to get for whether\nOr not lifetime I'll tell you what the difference is first of all the spark plugs are better but second of all and probably most important is the fuel\nFuel chained emission controls the engine to run in much cleaner now years ago when they had carburetors on them\nAnd then just were showed a dirty engine they would foul out the spark plugs now this is number one got a better ignition system on the vehicles now we've got our hottest part that burns anything off the spark plug spark plugs are better\nThe fuel is ... is a unleaded fuel now know led into fuel and I guess you're wiping airport you know the airplanes if they've got to lead to fuel Dale carbon quite often they're on an airplane engine\nAnd and then the ignition system the fuel system their mission control if you go into fuel injections where they all run and very clean now once they got rid of the collaborators and got the spark plugs last a hundred thousand ... engines more cleaner fuels cleaner\nThe ignition systems much better much hotter spark is just all it's a it's a total picture where everything works in conjunction with one another has done all of their jobs and makes to spark plugs last a lot longer\nOh great okay\nYeah I was worried about that by the way we uh you know uh where are you a base shorter plane you know where the north valley occupational center is\nYes right yeah right around the front of me right a\nA ... o'clock there during the summer are spark plug\nWow maybe I'll stop by there are no ... sure\nEvery every local and the other question for you are seeing a lot of advertising for a company that wants you to purchase a this\nExtended award the fear of car do you think of that well\nIt's a big moneymaker it's a big money maker I Would like to get into that business because you know at a if if you keep your car a long time and I always\nPrefer to drive it to get it\nFrom a dealer in other words not necessarily a deal I shouldn't say that one that's backed up by dealer like General Motors backed up by General Motors or Ford or Chrysler something like this and not XYZ in my opinion because they had a lot of problems in the past with people getting\nRipped off because first of all it's a big money maker I mean you give me two thousand dollars and all I have to do is sit on it and wait for your car to break down I take that money and invest it to say if I got\nA thousand people give me you know two thousand dollars look at the money I have overnight you know and I've got the money just sitting in the bank and making me interest on them you know making me money on their money and then when you call for problem than maybe I'll have to spend a little\nI used to know a guy named Sam Winston Sam Winston\nIs most of you know used to have wished entire here and and he was from North Carolina and I became friends I purchased one of his stores one time\nAnd he used to have a what we called the bonded warranty on tires bonded warranty any charge well two dollars extra tire so if anything happened to that tire\nHe would buy you a new tire where they sold millions and millions of tires so he just and ended up at the end of the year with you know with a hit stores all over and he told me one time he probably had two million dollars in the bank just from two dollars a tire over all the tire so he had to buy\nThat say a million dollars worth of tires to replace he's still made a lot of money is just mud that money makes money that's what it's all about\nBut they're reliable if you back by manufacture in my opinion\nOkay because this is just an individual company\nI Know that I Am as though it may be fine but those companies in the past I'm going in and out of business and with your money\nSo that's that was\nJust wondering oh hey Andy I wouldn't joke for me oh boy\nA joke that I'm a mode joke a\nWell I've heard this but what's the difference between a guitar and a tuna fish\nWas you can't you can tune a guitar but you can't tune tuna fish both can tune a guitar that you can't tuna fish that's\nAll right okay and I feel real quick I got it wrong yeah go ahead and\nDo it safely insect repellent flying insect repellent\nI'm not sure what the difference\nUh the flying set fruit ... has to be a approve\n[laughter] only pilot for all understand that thanks read and write a lifestyle All right have a great day\nEverybody's everybody's you know jokes to hear [laughter] you know a\nKenny in riverside Kenny ... got about a minute together and talk and that can hold your if your if you like and\nEither way it's really short okay um my ... my ... my digital governor is stop calculating it's just like froze up in ... meters also on zero what I was driving but at the speed armored works yes Saddam era where I'm at a word I Hope it works yeah\nIs it all digital is it digital or meant\nNo no my whole clusters guy digital just only the commenter\nOkay then that just go to bed gear inside needed to take it to speed on her shop a speed Ahmed her shop kid is going to have to repair that just probably get a bad year and that's a little plastic gear that Dr ... or any speed I'm going to shop can take care of that but I get in a\nFew and far between you know a speed ... shop so just checked it out and and they're the only ones you can fix that or get another unit and put it in\n... so the so the digital has or has a year I guess\nNot the digital digital is not this digital is all electronic but if it's a gear driven type of regular who dominant than\nA ... it's a digital digital he still go to speed on by the shops if they can fix it because there may be just the module is taking care of that so they have their their McCall thanks guinea for your call I appreciate it folks like

at the end of the show to create a the\nMoney for the winners at the end and he he rolls it well three hundred and sixty five days a year or at least three hundred and sixty days a year and has never

a lifestyle show and I wanted to think about that and\nHow come he never Rosa bankrupt um three hundred and sixty roles and yet three in a row and it happened to every week people always land on a\nOn a bankrupt or something as I Do I still love the show I just I'm just curious I welcome you calls about that what ... what do you think about that oh wait wait Mazda\nYou know Missouri's the one that came out with the rotary engine rotary engine and now Missouri's thinking about electrification and they're going to use the rotary engine which is real quiet and real very very smooth the you know if you've ever member of the\nThe Mazda rotary engine that ... you know when you drive that car is just a\nA ... per ... per automobile suburban engine I should say so smooth and vibration and\nSo they go make a real small rotary engine so an electric vehicles able to recharge the batteries and it will run and run you won't even here that motive running and will keep the battery charge I think that's pretty good idea for Mazda my hat's off to Mazda for\nComing up with coming up with that\nAnd also for we go back to the phone talking to build a Newport Beach there a\nThe a lot of the museums in in one museum that really like 'cause you know like a mall and museum as the automobile driving museum and they also got into a highly recommend going over there and in strolling around\nBut in some of the other museums where they have exotic cars like the guy days and things and they never showed them the are the mechanics of it and I noticed that when I went into the Peterson museum there the ... century about ... is the fact that uh [noise]\nYou know you look at all these beautiful cars and people are not concerned about all the styling into sleek necessarily be a cause any more everybody wants to see what's underneath the hood they've got those four cylinder engines six cylinder engines now people are wanting to start putting her foot up for the first time people want to see what's underneath the hood of these cars more so\nThan the styling other car they want to see the power plant which really\nMakes makes that tick there so that's just a a little bit of\nA news as well just go to the phones\nLet's go back to the phones and we're speaking with Bill the Newport Beach bill welcome to the program good morning\nAre more aware that very much certainly man I was just doing a lot of traveling uh this summer and I realized I use cruise control on my car ... and I realize I I honestly don't know how that works and here's my question if I'm going downhill especially\nThat cruise control keeps the car or whatever the speed it was set out as it used the brakes\nNo it just let it let solve well some of the cars that led solve a throw away most of it it'll decrease the throttle and then uh I don't know that it applies to breaks but it will slow down quite what year are we talking about\nOh two thousand Seventeen\nYeah that slows down quite rapidly yes it does when you when you start going downhill yeah my car does the same thing well [noise] I Do my\nBreak lights come on you know throw the people behind me don't see the car well worn down to like break\nWas to my knowledge to break lights no come on ... hospitable on these late model cars I haven't even thought about chicken that but uh I don't think it comes on but the the new cars are all computer control and they can cruise control Israel efficient if you want it\nWhat's interesting about the new cars the cruise control as you can set it I Want to be three car links behind the car in front of me\nAnd it may apply to break because of the car ... stopped\nIt would you know it'll slow down quite rapidly as well but if he won three car links for car lengths as you probably know you can set that to how far you want to be from the car in front of you\nAnd it will maintain it'll you know if you set the car said it at sixty and you've come up to another cardio actually start slowing down on the newer vehicles on the older ones it would not but on the new and just quite sophisticated\nYeah if it was very helpful for a shuttle long trip like golf or even in traffic out I have used that as well\nBut sometimes in traffic and it could be annoying but you got to reset at a time you step breaks you know an election it off and so then you've got to reset it each time but the way they on the newer cars we hit it back it goes back to the last setting that you had it set at\nA ... so it's a it's a it's a good feature to get the Trade Center long trips and he's from getting a ticket sometimes too\nYou
