pull up on this thing\nIt descends however many feet down he claims it's at least one atmosphere which is why it's a vacuum and then a ... and then it just propels you at a hundred and thirty miles an hour to your destination it's different than this hyper loop he's got going on which he claims will be six hundred miles per hour\nBut this is a this is something that is going to unveil the first section of it and he said it's a lot less money is able to do it with a lot less money than it was that last two miles of the of the red line or whatever that was it costs two billion dollars to do\nWell how much has a cost for it to to tunnel two miles under Los Angeles\nThat yet but he talked about half the cost of it um he because he sees shrink the size of the two in all of that he said

California has one party at this point and it's the Democratic party a but it does this represent a triumph of democratic policy\nOr is it actually reflection of how obnoxious and I don't mean that in

California thing\nGoing well that certainly does ah keep the same going and of course Austin is sort of the outlier for Texas in terms of a day Austin in many ways reflects California's political culture a wires the rest of the Texas of course is where all the people who couldn't stand\nCalifornia's political culture moved and that's really the story that really is the story is that that uh this is obviously the blues the blue states but there's a lot of factors that produced that including the exit is just so many Californians\nThat's absolutely correct and one of the things that really got me kind of looking into this I I spent a lot of time with US Census bureau data I Know my my life is terribly exciting but I worked for it they take a ... and so I was looking at\nAt the numbers of California's decline and Republican Party registration and then uh there is a very interesting poll out of Texas that was taken of the California diaspora\nAnd what the poll found is that by more than two to one the folks moving to Texas from California or conservative versus liberal and if you start adding those numbers up what you find is that the number of people who move out of California every year about half a million people move out about four hundred thousand people\nMove in so you get a ...\nYou know people move it out and people moving in that almost entirely explains the drop in Republican Party registration in California what's happening is that the Republicans are dying necessarily or re registering as Democrats or decline to state they're voting with their feet and they're moving out of state\nNow Chuck there's two things two points on this one a Senator Ted Cruz of course in a very tight in a heavily funded a Senate reelection campaign against Beto O'Rourke in Texas\nAnd he said and I think there's some wisdom to that because all these people have moved to Texas have not moved here to impose the same policies from the states that they just moved away from\nThat he's probably right about that and that could be the difference in that Senate seat or come election day but\nOne of the X factors that has also contributed to the ah exodus from California of more conservative voters\nIs the loss of the a ... of the aviation business the aircraft industry or the defense contractors when a Roman Northrop McDonald Douglas or Lockheed all these big companies that once employed thousands and thousands and thousands of workers\nAnd a lot of them were tied to military projects and when those jobs moved out of state a lot of the people who work

you\nWell should remind your listeners are pushing seeking asylum ... basically say that they face a persecution or well founded fear of persecution based on certain criteria basically they feel for their life or physical safety if you're not sleeping\nFor your life and physical safety then you wouldn't qualify for asylum there are other forms of immigration\nBut asylum is a specific thing I stop pushed in law so\nIf individuals arrive at the border and have no reason to come in to the United states they're not coming in with a green card or some temporary visa or something like that they won't be allowed in however\nIf we try to turn them around first off Mexico doesn't take them back they're not they are citizens\nEven though they cross through Mexico second if they ask for asylum out of port of entry then then they get an appointment with a credible fear interview at all have and then from there it seems like they at least democratic ... fear they go into the more formal asylum process\nYes so that's what would happen now that system because of all the applicants at the southern border\nHas exploded I think the figure I saw it increased six fold to nearly three hundred thousand people in the queue right now in the process of having their asylum claims adjudicated so the whole system is kind of overwhelmed now and people know that so what happens\nIs we essentially release people in the United states especially if they if they have children with them because we won't hold children for very long we'd tried separating\nAre releasing the children to a family member here and holding the parents but that didn't work and we're only doing that for a subset of people trying to get in um but we don't do that so we won't be able to hold them we don't have the detention space so we will\nRelease them now you might ask well why don't they apply for asylum in Mexico if they truly are fleeing for their lives and that would be a reasonable position by US law says that even though international treaty doesn't require that is in fact\nUsually you can deny a hearing someone's asylum claim 'em when they fled through a country they could have applied in\nOur law still lets them apply so that's one of the loopholes or inability to hold families as another loophole that we have a lack of detention space is another Mexico's refusal to take people back is another problem so basically when these folks get to the southern border if they apply for asylum they'll basically\nAll get in so many yesterday I asked why don't they just go to the U.S that the consulate in their own country and say I'd like to apply for\nYou know I'm you know asylum in America can I go no that's the reason why they do the pilgrimage right because when they get to the border it's a lot easier to just say real very rarely I there's really no risk of being turned down if you just show up right\nNow that doesn't mean you're going to get asylum or or or or legal status in the United states\nBut you can just join the illegal population which for many of them seems like a much more attractive price so that's why they're doing it nobody thinks that these individuals mostly have the gym in a silent right\nWe know that because they don't usually show up the majority don't show up for their hearings when we schedule them for their asylum if that's not what they're trying to do there are some people there who may well have a legitimate asylum claim and people can and do also go to a ... in in Honduras or Guatemala and apply but that's not what this is about\nThis is using the asylum system and the loopholes we have in our laws Mexico's policies our failures combine to just get into the United and\nDon't they know they're overwhelming the system with the sheer numbers and and knowing that that probably works in their favor as well\nRight right all of that helps and so when we say oh well you know we'll we'll fortified the border that's not going to solve the problem because people will just come to a port of entry and ask for asylum and under US law are options become very limited very\nFast we're talking with Steven camaraderie who's the director of research for the center for Immigration Studies\nA Steven can you talk to us about uh the uh financing of this a\nCaravan there's been a lot of ... you know means and video posted eccentric center I'm always a reluctant to jump on the bandwagon on that 'cause you know it's people can post anything or the allegation that this is a George Soros funded you know joined source apparently funds everything but\nFor somebody bombing but but ... and the timing of\nThis because it certainly seems to me having this caravan show up on the U.S border on the fourteen days out from an election that would probably be about a six days out from the election by the time they actually arrive\n... you know if some if anybody was going to fund this it seems to me it would be Donald Trump because I don't see how that would help Donald Trump's argument that this immigration situation as a catastrophe\nLike a couple things hundreds of people are being released into the United states every week so this is not\nReally that different in some sense it represents all the problems in the system and it kept fit into stark relief\nIs there evidence that this is being funded probably activists behind it to some extent but everybody all the weaknesses are now well known all the loopholes are there and our self evident so people are perfectly capable of organizing themselves to some extent\nMaybe at the ... of others but yeah it doesn't seem like politically it helps the Democrats because they're the ones who don't want to spend more they're the ones you don't want to change the asylum little they're the ones you don't want to beef up the border so you would think all of that\nWould tend to play in the Republican hand so I don't think there's any reason to think that there's any big money maybe little maybe there's some organization that gets money for through some foundation and somebody in that organization is playing a role and encouraging people to come but that's not really the story\nThe story is um people know that if they make it to the border and ask for asylum particularly if they have a child\nThey can pretty much be guaranteed that after a brief time in detention or maybe no time at all they will be released in the United states and can join the illegal population and they never need show up at their hearing or anything like that and they'll just live and work in the United states illegally they they know it there\nAnd wait and wait wait till the political tide turns and there's an amnesty and then its mission accomplished if that's what they choose to do the uh you know the there has been no secret about this and one of the things that we've heard from a number of people who are in this care of them is that\nThe uh you know they they come in these large groups as a work around the\nHuman traffickers because if they their safety in numbers when you come in a large group of people in this TV cameras news reporters following them wary about coyote I don't have to worry about rape and don't have to worry about being asked to mule drugs into the country in an odd way\nIt actually well not in an odd way in a very smart way it's safer for people to enter the country this way in every way shape or form than it is to use the coyote use that are going to charge you twenty thousand dollars on hold your cousins hostage unless they you pay extra extortion\nRight it's safety through Mexico with all the disorder and issues that exist in Mexico it's safer\nAt the border and then when you get there in math it helps to further over on an already tax system making your release all the more quick and easy so yeah no it makes perfect sense and that's why I said there's no reason people are smart enough to figure out the incentives\nAnd there's no reason it is and has to be anybody urging them to do it it it ... it may not be entirely spontaneous but it could be and it doesn't need anybody to there's no conspiracy here it's our failures and certain policies of the intervening countries\nThat lead people to do that and the fact that there's enormous wage differential between these countries and the United states\nIf you could quadruple your income even by living in the United states illegally and your children would have many more opportunities and they and the possibility very real exists of an amnesty and full legalization down the road why not do it\nUh this is I Want to go back a\nTo a point that you made earlier than I think is the most significant point that has been missed in all of this in the previous caravan when the administration in my opinion made a colossal\nMistake when they separated the children from the parents without uh any any way of reuniting them really an organized way to reunite them and the facilities in place\nUh to accommodate this everything had to be ad lib but but what was missed in that and it's going to be missed in this story is is that this happens every single day the only reason that this is in the news is because it's a large group of people who are advertising their arrival\nAh and attracted cameras but the thing is day in day out we have a and I'm going to take a mobile number but we essentially have the population of Pittsburgh show\nEvery year in this country illegally and that's a low ball number because Pittsburgh is not a large city despite the fact that they have major league hockey football and baseball\nA ... in Pittsburgh is a small city of about three four hundred thousand people but we easily have that many people show up in this country illegally every year and they're not all coming across the border in fact a big chunk of them are coming into airports and people just fly into the country and vanish

Nathan involved he's been terrific\nWe don't know what we're going to get from price but I just think one through the scrubs in the bullpen the Dodgers pitching as superior to Boston but Boston might have an advantage on offensively because the Dodgers are kind of all or nothing off fence and prone to strike outs\nExactly and that and I wrote a ... I wrote several weeks ago I was during the first round against Atlanta that the Dodgers can be the most entertaining at the same time most frustrating team in baseball to watch because of the fact\nThat there is that all or nothing approach and that\nGuys are up there swinging for the fences and it's all about launch angle and its whole modern nothing and\nAs a consequence you know when you need a single you can't get it and you leave guys on base and that's what's frustrating I think toward the end of ... the Milwaukee series you started to see\nSome guys anyway\nTake a more nuanced approach and go the other way and and take what they were being given it I'll be interested to see if that continues especially in Boston with the green monster looming\nBehind left field all those right handed hitters are are they are they going to remain disciplined or are they going to see that and say hey I'm going to see if I went over it\nOr we're talking with Jim Alexander a sports columnist with the Southern California newsgroup let's talk about the rivalry between the two cities because there really hasn't been a baseball rivalry but they're obviously is huge deep roots in the NBA between the Lakers and the Celtics the two premier basketball franchises\nSo that beat out ... you can expect to hear that\nThe written the red Sox fans have always been traditionally inventive and coming up with invective\nA in coming up with some kind of a a I'm sure many Machado is going to inherit all the villain status he got with Milwaukee and there'll be happy to do yeah carry that over into Fenway but the issue is good\nHe's been a very good he'll by the way ...
