lawyers going you know back and forth across a across that divide\nWe're also going to share a new poll that were officially releasing tomorrow\nUm it's two thousand Americans we actually did this poll before the Kavanaugh\nOf things just blew up so it was early September the plurality of the two thousand Americans that we polled said that they fear that the United states\nIs on its way to a new civil war now when you add in Kavanaugh the pipe bombs and everything else that's happened in a sense\nOf the other sort of general take away from from all of this is um you know if the politicians and the media well to it and if our president is still leading by tweets uh then I think most of the changes we're looking for is going to have really have to come from the grassroots\nIncluding a ... you know religious leaders stepping forward and I think very important we have to really reach out and gets about our neighbors add up go out of our comfort zone a little bit I Know that this coming Sabbath\nI Hope uh you know the Jews and and in Los Angeles a usually come let's say for the high holy days maybe they'll ah you know go friday night or Saturday just to make a statement a because our freedoms and especially religious freedoms is what's a you know being the touchstone of of American democracy\nAnd our society and without question this assault\nWas meant to put a doctor and every juice heart\nAnd their broader sense that it is a challenge we talked about anti Semitism there isn't much we can do about it we have to be able to deal with our neighbors work with our neighbors that means also be there for our neighbors and their times of crisis so we only have a lot of work to do\nUm the ... the place of Jews in American society goes back to the very founding of the country uh one of the more uh important moments in American history in terms of religious freedom was a George Washington's letter to the congregation in Newport Rhode Island\nAnd it's the ... a synagogue which to this day are still a commemorates that by a public reading of Washington's letter\nOr to the Jewish community where he said made the children of the stock of Abraham who dwelling this land continued to merit enjoy the goodwill of the other inhabitants while everyone shell sit under his own vine and fig tree and then she'll be none to make them afraid\nOr those words were written over two hundred years ago and they're still a as true today but the reality is as I mentioned in the in the opening a rabbi this attack in Pittsburgh was the most violent attack against Jews in the history of the country which is really astonishing when you consider\nThat a we make the assumption I clearly wrongly so that we have transcended a lot of this uh you know historic anti Semitism or certainly post World war two\n... and in yet now we have the largest attack that's ever taken place so we've got as you said a lot more work to do\nAnd and a member of the FBI statistics going back to the early nineties every single year African American so the number one target of hate a race based hate and American Jews are are the number one target of religion Bay State despite the fact that we're relatively speaking a miniscule part\nOf the overall um population so uh it's always been there a with us this is the greatest country in the history of the world in terms of a ... a Jews we we've uh we are at home here I'm a third generation American\nBut the fact of the matter is that uh you know wearing that badge of honor of being a Jew and another badge of honor Being American sometimes comes with consequences and I'm not sure we have more bigots out there today\nBut with the Internet with social media and uh you know with the marketing\nCapabilities of the Internet\nRight they're available to uh to the evildoers from ISIS to the shooter in Pittsburgh I'm afraid we're going to see more um domestic and other kinds of terrorism or aimed at our our nation and in our community and other minority communities\nAnd uh I just I don't want to say that we we might see a much larger numbers because our capacity\nTo kill in a situation is also been\nA ... or ... or ...\nIncreased uh and uh you know we're in the best of times and we learned in the worst of times the most important thing people Los Angeles can do today is to reach out across that divide a speak to\nThe children because our kids are absorbing stuff every day on the edge of that they may not volunteer the information so this is a very good Thai maybe a critical time for um you know for people who are religious\nAnd people who are not yet religious to take a deep breath and try to understand what are the motivations how do we identify and isolate a the grade those capabilities and let's say that people are gathered who started this to pick up\nUh could be a but it does this represent a desperation\nOr a flush economy in other words people are feeling comfortable with their disposable income that they go down there and split their tens and hope that Seventeen red pops up or is it\nA sign of desperation like you know people queuing up to buy lottery tickets that this was the only way I'm ever going to get out of here as dumb law and there's a lot better odds than roulette than the lottery there is one at a thirty calm\nDown boy calmed down we don't need you to get old enough to get on the lottery I think that we got the point I think they're feeling like they have a little more cash in the pocket and they are going to feel like they're going to get a little more lucky\nI don't know my luck ran out years ago I don't think he should feel lucky and I ...

are but you know when I had a baby and they're like\nOh careful don't give your baby any peanut products are peanut butter and I'm like really that they did knock that down a little bit and they're like you can give your kid or try your kid on a little bit of peanut butter and see if they're allergic\nThey've lessened that a little bit because I'm like\nWhat happened when nobody was worried

now because now they're coming after the sesame seeds they're going to go after my big Macs\nA we are halfway through our first thirty minute nonstop news blitz of the day as you know uh this morning we had a conversation with a rabbi Abraham Cooper who's the associate dean of the Simon ... center all of this and the aftermath of the attack horrible attack on the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd the rising level of hate and people acting on that uh in modern America and specifically anti Semitism joining us right now to talk about this after as powerful reaction to this event is the mayor of the city of Los Angeles a mayor Eric Garcetti good morning Mr Mayor how are ya\nI'm OK Doug thank you so much for for doing this program\nAh well we appreciate you coming on I I I've been ah I've known for quite a few years and you as a general keep your emotions in check and talking about\nPublic policy and in terms of uh even when a tragedy well I don't want to use the word tragedy because this is an atrocity to me a tragedy is an accident and this wasn't an accident but this really hit home to you and you were very emotional and very unusual\nIt hit me incredibly hard I mean this whole week um pipe bombs being sent to folks and then\nTo African Americans hunted down um by somebody looking for black people to kill and then as a Jew and the first elected Jewish mayor of ah the city of Los Angeles and it just you know the most basic things we do go shopping or ship 'em live our lives\nNow are looking over our shoulders and it was a moment which everybody said don't get political and I certainly don't think we should get part of it but I said you know at this moment um you've got to stop us hey we've got to stop this language you've got to stop this violence we've got to stop these threats\nAnd here and the third largest Jewish city in the world um you know it was important I think for us to come together with folks that we've been there for our Muslim\nAllies and African Americans and Christians who and churches and mosques and you know other folks have been attacked we've always stood with them as Jews it was a very depressing moment but a very uplifting moment to see in the city and around the country people say everybody belongs here and we've got to stop this we've got to cut it off\nOr it's astonishing to think actually that in October of twenty Eighteen this nation suffered the worst attack on Jews in our history\nBecause we like to believe any way that we've grown a and move past the historic anti Semitism that's actually less or in the United states and almost every corner of the world going back to George Washington's letter to the synagogue in Newport Rhode Island in the Seventeen nineties\nBut uh the reality is is that the Internet at ... and these guys if you will have brought hate\nOr into the ... into the onto the front burner in ways that we are not possible pre digital connectivity and that's something we just have to deal with that it is possible for haters\nA to find each other and to organize and to reinforce their toxic belief in ways that are in the old days in the in the analog days ... you know it was really a tough to find fellow travelers\nAre absolutely and and you know you had to find somebody who might have had a book of conspiracy like the protocols of The Elders of Zion now you can find 'em your fellow\nUh haters quickly and you know anti Semitism like a lot of forms of prejudice doesn't ever really go away it just ebbs and flows at it might feel new but this is an old and poison as well and I think I'm anybody's Jewish knows it well South African American friend who said you know\nThis is what we live with every single day and maybe you know juice I think I don't know what you who hasn't picture it at some point oh my gosh what ... what would happen if this synagogue was attacked and then it certainly did happen which only reinforces\nThat you were raised to be careful and you know I think for all of us when we look at the scapegoating that's going on when people are looking to blame we can disagree in this country without being disagreeable we can\nNot point out that there's conspiracies behind every time we disagree with that somebody is funding this or you know those dog whistles that are blown up even more than dog whistles I mean we have swastikas that were marching by synagogue in Charlottesville and if we don't have strong leadership across the board just condemning not and then getting back to you know having our party debates and our disagreements about\nPolicy which is fine of immigration or on multiculturalism or schools whatever it is we've been able to do that as Americans as an example to the world and a better way but unfortunately this weekend we saw the worst of it\nWe're talking with Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti I'm ... in our conversation with rabbi Cooper this morning a ... and I'm not I'm not bringing us up to inject or partisan politics in it but it's just it's just the nature of what we have to deal with today at the\nThe anti Semitism on the right that is easy to identify because if you're a if you are identifying yourself as a Nazi and twenty Eighteen well you've pretty much labeled yourself what you are\nBut we also have a very very pernicious rise of anti Semitism on the far left and it's expressing itself on college campuses including major universities here in Los Angeles UCLA and others\nWere Jewish groups and Jewish students have felt more than threatened a and this is something that we're going to have to put into the conversation as well because it's coming from both extremes\nNo question you know it was funny the other night I'm a a leader in the community at our vigil in West wood said hey we want to make sure we don't say anything that defense supporters of President Trump and I said look we have to condemn whether it's coming from B.D us the boycott divest sanctions movement and some of the anti Semitism connected to that\nOr whether it comes from you know somebody who's the president United States not speaking how strongly enough or\nUm you know a buying into the conspiracy that George Soros a Jew is helping you know a caravan of immigrants come you're right you absolutely have to call out friends\nYou have to call out people that you support and doesn't mean that you're betraying anybody it means that you are living up to your values as an American and I I think this country comes first always the idea that\nJews have been here in the long hair and no matter what the color of your skin no matter what your background of this is a place where you belong and um I think it comes from the left it comes from the right comes to the federal was from ignorance is what it comes from and\nYet it spreads 'em at all gone unchecked it's not that one person's um condemnation or lack of condemnation leads to a shooting something like that happens because of a crazy person who is filled with hate filled with conspiracies but if they don't hear anything else I mean the word to use was\nThe um I think he used the word genocide um that that that the Jews were bring committing genocide to my people the shooter said which is [noise]\nYou know boggles the mind of Jews were somehow being genocide because he saw a group that is helping refugees come to this country just as Jews did once which is our tradition so you're right it is left and it's right but it's also one here we see a very clear connection in this case\nUh between what you know Jewish activist groups do to support refugees and and this guy decided that that was somehow\nA threat to him\nOr what steps are the LAPD taking a ... given the fact that we had the mail bombs go out including Fifteen at least Fifteen people identified by the FBI in Los Angeles area including congresswoman Maxine Waters office\nAnd then the Pittsburgh incident you always have to be on guard for copy cats we had the view from Ferraro attack of the Jewish center in the valley years ago so this is something that we obviously have to tend to\nA this does reek of their polling tells them that six is going to lose and this is the established sharing a basis for a legal process\nOr after a lecture that hope I'm wrong about that but that's what it looks like to me it's eight thirty or it looks

today\nI don't want to identify her 'cause I don't know if she wants to be identified but I'm working with somebody in another project\nWhose mom worked with monkeys those little monkeys that they use working ... she was training them to work with people who are ... are quadriplegic so they could have won the parents for person opener jarred whatever what you said was\nAfter working with monkeys for a while to try and train them for people who are required to put you could probably should she said monkeys or answers she would drain the monkey to actually do the task and then the person in the wheelchair would blow into a two and a treat would come down and it would be a prize for the monkey which would incentivize them to keep doing it\nWell she found out after a very short time you could figure out the fact that oh the person blows and the two the tree comes up they would not wait to do that sure they go up behind the person slim their head down into the troop forcing air out and\nAll the treats [laughter] not the best use of a monkey and they're jerks they're not going to philanthropic they don't care about helping people in wheelchairs and people were quadriplegic they just want the treats and they figured out a way to get the trees\nIn the city council in Akron, Ohio has put an order this and this is news writing they put teeth into a city ordinance than it tends to address

owner offense or and now they're talking about opening a second\nOffense to two hundred and fifty dollars and allow for the possibility of sixty days in jail for the dog didn't know for the dog owner right because it's irritating it's annoying and here's what happened that people live\nBehind this they're very nice people\nThey work very hard long hours and they work very hard to uh to fix the house up and make the back yard\nReally a a play space for their kids and the kids' friends and it's fun it's fun to see the tree house it's fun to see the kids running around the back yard actually playing outdoors not in the video game but here's the problem because they work long hours the big German Shepherd parks all day and oftentimes 'til eleven o'clock at night\nBarring them when they're

thing [noise] um [noise] often times the dog owners don't know what's happening because the dog only does it when you're not home yeah and then the thing is people get nuts like Randy way\nAnd they go through the\nSweet little angel shut up stop that microphone but we we don't get to say and as you are the problem I Can't wait to you go to the good\nNeighbors we just don't call like the cops and

[noise]\nHold on a second they're realistic\n[laughter] that that good bad good [noise]\nA oftentimes relationships are portrayed in a dramatic fashion whether it's a streetcar named desire or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and you see these major infidelity and a secret lives that terror couples apart a and rivalry\nBut it has been my experience that most relationships disintegrate because of a death by a thousand paper cuts it's snoring\nIt's a cold feet it's a ... why don't you wouldn't kill you to empty the dishwasher for once in your life or how about putting a tool back where you took it from ... or when the red light comes on that uh the economy's oil or why don't you to actually get some oil\nAnd not the Sox are five feet away from the hamper can you just pick them up and put 'em in the hamper the bad stuff like\nThat that they're clocking noise that you make when you're chugging or a beer for God's sakes or that thing you said to my mother you know it's it's all these things pile up and then the next thing you know you're sleeping separate bedrooms and calling\nLawyers this is why my fact because always been every time you think you have a complaint swallow it down with your pride\nJust a real fresh air rage uh and and but you see at work the same thing happens because we have home relationships and then we have workplace relationships you gotta work\nOr in the cubicle next to the guy with the Dilbert cartoons were in a relationship Doug yeah that's if you noticed we keep you on the other room behind glass of wine thick glass [noise]\nA ... and we got a whole box of those little green pine trees that people hanging around their rearview mirrors just in case glass breaks anyway\nAh here's one of apparently the greatest triggers for workplace friction\nAnd that is the battle over the thermostat year and this goes this takes place in the home as well because everybody knows that every woman on earth is cold all the time and every guy on earth is hot all the time yeah\nOr unless you get into the change your life in which case or the woman can actually become a blast furnace\nBefore then revert back to the little ...\nAnd usually the compromises either you're putting on a blanket her I'm new to get up\nAnd and I know for instance I I put out a thousand BTU I can heat the entire house\nWhen when our air conditioner was out for two weeks in the heat in the brutal a triple digit temperatures in the San Fernando valley this summer in July was literally a hundred and fourteen degrees a penny was looking for a sweater\nOn the same way now um and now it's interesting you should ... because on a daily basis you know when Leon sweet and got hired to join us as the news anchor of McAteer in the morning on TALK radio seven I became the weekdays from five to ...\nAlmost two years ago uh I went out and bought a fan and I and I've had it in Studio with me ever since I have\nThis little uh Lakewood personal fan and I keep it right here next to the you know hit a stick a piece of paper in there you can hear your mother to not to be back at least\n... the paper not at a finger yeah yeah\nI only got out of his finger I did that only four or five times a but I keep the fan here because I knew a wind witness going to be here not just ... any female or a news anchor is going to immediately come in and turn the thermostat up to ten dory oven is an actual setting their brick kill them and um\nSo I I Walk in every day and it's a thousand degrees but I don't complain I just turned the fan on everybody's happy she's warm I got a little sea breeze going here\nHis fiance over there he brings his eyes and he's got the ... yeah and law re flowing in the brain and um and\nEverybody's happy but here's what's about to happen we're about forty five minutes till then\nPeter Till the right ... yeah he's going to come breathing in here to go on and on and on about what his show is going to be like for to aid does almost two hours telling us what the show's going to be for two hours or so he'll come in here before we're done to promote what he's got coming up on the show\nBut the first thing is going to do is he's going to go over to the thermostat and he's going to set it on McMurdo bay which is a famous uh al ... of uh of Antarctica yeah he's going to set it to a setting that would murder penguins\nYeah and there's one thing there's a lot of things that don't work at KBC including me\nBut there's a lot of things that don't work but there's one thing that works at KBC and that the air conditioner\nReal fast who literally snowing before he even gets from the door with a thermostat is to his chair\nNow if not snow baby mixed with sleep yeah but there will inhale but there will be ice crystals forming and I'm Amazed\nThat between the temperature that she puts the thermostat add to the drop in temperature that children creates\nThat we have not had raining here yeah or I don't know about that we don't shattered glass yeah Fritz will tell us it's going to be like that\nAnd my guess is is that this goes on all day long all across America you're sitting at one cubicle\nAnd uh the guy next year he's got a whole different at all day long and don't they actually end up a lot of places end up putting a glut of Plexiglas case over the service that with all the all yeah they lock it up they have to they'll have fights and you know who has the key whoever has the key is usually HR or the or\nOr the person who's in charge of the physical plant and that person is that the temperature to the way they like it because you know\nPeople lie about ... they they always walking by oh I've got to go get some coffee or I Need to go to the bathroom and they go and they quickly like turn down the thermostat and then there'll be like why don't I didn't hear what I don't know and then somebody else has to go get some water they have to go to the phrase and then they turn it back down and fingerprint ... yeah\nWell I go to ... to save a marriage now because you get in trouble if you touch the thermostat get one of those ... steps you can control it on your phone\nYeah but don't they don't like I've seen commercials now were they had the different temperature beds that are split in half for that purpose like a couple of designed it because they were fighting over the temperature of the bed and they have the the door temperature match with is I think\nWe've got a solution for that I have a giant fan on my side of the bed and she has an electric blanket only ...\n... it's gonna rain in the middle of turns on the electric blanket in July yeah I'm here I'm pretty much year round to yeah we have one of those are the buck the oldest who's a technologist gave us a nest ... three years ago yeah love it still in the bud oh God [laughter]\nI'm Still in the ... and it's been in the box is that is because he refused to do it because you you don't want to install I don't want it I I have no interest in I don't find it to be an ordeal to walk in the door and turn the thermostat\nTo do it you have a lot I knew that knowledge\nLike what's the point it's like because here's the deal a ... it's another thing that will break\nIt's another thing that will all of a sudden I'll have to upload a Yahoo yeah you know software somebody can break and I make our house really hot and then they send you know ... you know a friend pickle is hacking my house yes\nTurn it off by air conditioner and when he ... and I'm Serious that is a real concern us all the little stuff the DWI peeking shut your electricity off because they already threatened to do it\nThey were threatening to do it with the wind storms coming up and they did it up in northern California they just turned the power off and said oh we're going to have high winds which means power lines you can come down which is going to shut the electricity off now and save ourselves the\nTrials that also means you're yeah the the AC that you put in the wall units also goes off yeah they can't control that just by digitally like by the the nest or whatever they can do on your\nPhone now but if you've got central air they similar yeah you know they now they meaning the Russians can control from anywhere what's your air conditioning or your heating is and I refused to give up that power\nA now speaking of the digital world uh this is kind of fascinating in its own right not surprising either\nBecause uh the\nFolks up in Silicon valley who invented all these digital devices like the nest thermostat uh apparently\nAfraid of what it's doing to their own kids or will do to their own kids so they're having their nannies police their kids are self smartphone and uh I've had a time a Silicon Valley parents are increasingly obsessed\nAnd uh they found that uh the effects\nWere most market when it came to literacy growing up with a few books in the home resulted in below average literacy label levels and being surrounded by eighty books boosted the levels to average and the literacy continue to improve\nA until libraries reach about three hundred and fifty books at which point the literacy rates leveled off\nHow do they know that he didn't have any books growing up and me no words just fine\nYou got the best words a but it's it's really it's really fascinating they uh they asked for a response to give the range of books that in their home growing up anywhere from ten or less to more than five hundred\nAnd ... it is interesting because it's at a point where I guess three hundred and fifty is the magic number where if you have more than three hundred and fifty bucks it doesn't make any more difference you've already kind of ... right out but below that there's a noticeable difference in performance of literacy and if you can you can read you can learn anything\nOr how many books do you need to get to order level a Mac entire level\nWell right now I've got to I'm not kidding I have a hundred books in the car today that I have to let go of and it's killing me to let go of average thickness average pay a dollar store stuff's oh boy a it's a nine thirty\nOne let's go
