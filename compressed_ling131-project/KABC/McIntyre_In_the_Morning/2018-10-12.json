famously serve one term in Congress in the Eighteen forties and he was a peace candidate and he was absolutely opposed to the Mexican American War he thought that it was All right he thought that it was a gross a injustice to Mexico and it cost him his house seat\nAnd then Fifteen Years later here is leading the north and the civil war and Lincoln with someone you know he said to a friend of his you know I'm over sensitive I Can't even watch the chicken being slaughtered how do you think that feel being responsible for oceans of blood\nOr we're talking with Michael Beschloss American a historian his new book is called presidents of war the epic story from each you know seven to modern times\nYou know a week in these kind of one of the many American um riddles that Americans like to see themselves as a peace loving people and I think that that is generally true and yet for peace loving people self involved and an awful lot of wars\nOr in two hundred years some small wars that we've largely forgotten in some big wars and some new waters including the quasi wars\nOr that went on during John Adams administration which was quite a\nA a negotiation and it's a quite a tense time in its own right but these hot wars that you write about include some that people are really forgotten I mentioned the Mexican American War the Spanish American war\nIs another one that resulted in a president who had experienced war for first hand William McKinley was a sergeant in the civil war and one of my favorite stories he's commander was another president Robert Hayes a\n... a ... thing and you know we're all for war when they're in World War two little war but the Mexican war although at a lot of good effect of California joined the of the United states not least of them that was fought over they create a\nFake border incident in Mexico that cause James Pope ah for a war against Mexico that he wanted for other reasons or\nAs you were saying that Italy for a big war against thing even though it turned out it was the end the think the ah American ship the made an event a harbor and then those civil famously Lyndon Johnson\nNineteen Seventy sixty four\nOn route for authorization to wage a large or over this incident what he called an unprovoked attack on the Gulf of Tonkin off of North Vietnam\nVery quickly he realized with that never happened yet but congressional resolution based on that Johnson and Nixon used to wage war against Vietnam for ten years\nKilled almost sixty thousand Americans\nUh we're talking with Michael Beschloss the book is called a presidents of war and the epic story from Eighteen oh seven to modern times\nOr one of the things that's characteristic of modern wars and this has really been true since World War two a Congress does not give declarations of war anymore we give these they have a\nYou know ... a resident we had these resolutions and the words that race was forty two\nAnd the and part of the reason is is that when you declare war officially declare war\nYou cede awesome wartime powers to presidents and and uh I don't think that Congress\nAnd Congress tries to have it both ways where by not declaring war officially which is the constitutional way to do things they can avoid blame if they if it doesn't go well and they can take credit if it does go well but it's really not it should not be the way we go about this\nIn the constitution the president wants a big war has got to go to Congress got a declaration from the house and Senate\nAnd our system works best when their credit you wanted to say that the beginning of a war how that affects how long we're going to pay comedy people might be killed so that just as your thing to give it goes badly or the Congress will be there on the crash landing just as it was on the take off\nA why did you write this book at this time\nBecause I think\nOne of the biggest danger is we've got is that President now are able to start or singlehandedly almost overnight and one day may be tempted to do it for the wrong reasons because\nA modern president might look at George W. Bush who've numbers were fairly mediocre before the Gulf War and for the Gulf War it waged at which the right thing to do from my point of view\nHis numbers went up to Ninety percent of what the founders originally worried about was the president would become like the kings of Europe you know when the king got unpopular\nIt was contrived a reason for war the people would unite there'd be a victory that all the founders wanted to make sure that never happened here but one day sadly it will\nUm I I'm curious when a there was a book came out a couple of years ago by Christian rose called the president's war and it's so yeah I I thought so too it's specifically about\nHow the six or living presidents as the civil war broke out how they responded\nTo the civil war and that included not on the Lincoln but John Tyler Martin Van Buren a James Buchanan Millard Fillmore and uh\nAnd Franklin Pierce and it really is astonishing how the those former presidents some of them became outright Confederate sympathizer in fact I think John Tyler's served in the Confederate Congress a I\nThink that's exactly right and sometimes people take the wrong or take the wrong or ... you know the wrong verdict from all these things for instance or of Eighteen twelve our first major war was the most popular or unpopular war in American history more unpopular to Vietnam\nAnd also with oppose probably by about half the Congress and half the American people and to achieve that subject objectives were the candidate for the United states and the bread and butter and our ship neither of those things happened yet with the glory of victory because if it were a member of the\nStar Spangled banner and don't give up the ship and a young man during the war of Eighteen twelve was James Polk who thought of Eighteen twelve of such a victory for the president that he wanted one to\nA that's exactly right and it's really the battle of New Orleans Andrew Jackson which was fought after the war technically was older that are that turned the war of Eighteen twelve into an American victory when I was at best to push\nThe book is called a president's award the epic story from age you know seven to modern

and and I do recommend by the way not only Michael's book but if you get a chance to read the president's wore\nA it is a great read and it talks literally about there were six\nThey're actually seven presidents who are alive when the civil war broke out Abraham Lincoln in office and there were six other presidents the most we've ever had a live at one time and then there are how they approached their attitude towards the actual civil war when it was being fought is astonishing some of them were\nSort of well again when you read it you you you have a even a greater appreciation for how
