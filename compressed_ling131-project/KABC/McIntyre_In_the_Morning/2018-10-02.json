a determined last Thursday the California sanctuary stay protections for illegal immigrants infringed on Huntington Beach is local control is a charter city\nMaking Huntington the first city to successfully challenge S. B. fifty four which is of course the or\nThe sanctuary state a bill that was authored by Kevin deli on\nUh the the city attorney a for a Huntington Beach argued the case Michael gates is the name and carried the day before judge James Crandall joining us rented to talk about this is the city attorney for Huntington Beach Michael gates welcome aboard Mr Gates how are you\nGood morning how are you I'm fine first of all congratulations and a thank you very much\nAnd talk to us about what was the argument that you made as it talked about what a charter city is and why that made a difference\n[noise] sure so uh so there are four hundred and eighty two cities in the state of California or a hundred and Twenty one of which are charter cities when it's when a general our city seeks to declare some sort of independence from the state of California um\nAnd to establish some level of local control free of state interference they can adopt a charter\nAnd when you when you're when a city adopts the charter it's it's basically a mini constitution for the city itself and then also like I said a declaration of independence\nArticle eleven section five car of the of the California Constitution\nCarved out a certain amount of local control so what the city of Huntington Beach did was it said to the state of California in its lawsuits challenging has to be fifty four is hey control over our police department\nAre with regards to law enforcement activities and control over our own spending of our general fund money's those are quote municipal affairs and quote that are specifically\nProtected and provided for by the California Constitution\nSo I'm SP fifty four in essence was an overreach or because it's hard to tell our police department what can and cannot do\nWith regard to its law enforcement activities and also it told 'em it was ... it it tells cities where they can and cannot do with its resources whether it's public schools um designating them as safe havens or general fund moneys that we couldn't spend money on certain activities with regard to law enforcement and that was just that's too far that's an unconstitutional overreach\nAnd it's actually built into the California Constitution expressly so it's a huge win for me but I also want to clarify shoots when for every other city that has a charter like Huntington Beach is so this is a pretty broad ruling and it's a significant blow to the state law\nWell that's how I see it a undoubtedly there will be an appeal because this is a this is a ... you know obviously a hundred and eighty degrees away\nFrom the dominant political culture in the state of California in a threat to their thinking right\nAnd and and quite frankly Huntington Beach was the only city in the entire state of California although other cities were passing ordinances and resolutions in response to actually ...\nI'm Sorry SP fifty for um they were asking one instance right and resolutions this is the only law suit um and and the the reason that we sued just because like I said it was an overreach um but\nOur basis for our challenges built in expressly under the constitution so in a way\nI'm surprised we're the only city when it goes up on appeal the appellate courts gonna have to see the same constitution that we see it's article ... section five subdivision be um and even subdivision a applies as well so um if they're in plain English um it says right there that\nI'm a local affair for a charter city is managing his police force it's right there in the constitution and\nNo state law can supersede the state the state constitution excuse me so you know it will go up on appeal I don't doubt it um but I don't\nThat you might get hit with a golf ball from the Ryder Cup um hiring ... we'd knows my

S. M. C. A. which sounds like the United States Marine corps but ... not ... let's find out from NBC News correspondent bills and fear bill how are ya\nI'm doing great guys good morning thank you so ah ...\nThe Canadian deal sort of centered around and we know that there was a big dust up between the president and ah the Canadians over dairy access to the Canadian market for us dairy products and this seems to be some concessions made on that\nBut is this a a a radical remaking of NAFTA or is this just sort of a window dressing\nYeah not really I mean the president says this is a whole new deal it really is a modification of NAFTA and kind of a combination ah as well with the specific partnership\nWhich is interesting because that's also something that Donald Trump pulled out of a it included a Canada a as part of that TPP and there are actually a couple of drinks and this deal dealing with the online commerce and intellectual property protections that almost come right out of the TPP\nA show a it's kind of a combination of reworking\nOf NAFTA here the U.S MCA the big difference that you mentioned the dairy there yeah this opens up a little more of the Canadian dairy market to us farmers are good for us dairy farmers\nIn fact in Canada the farmers there are so upset they say hey look we we've been thrown under the bus in order to make this deal a and they're looking for compensation from the government of Canada as a result of that the other part of this is the automotive\nPiece which includes both Canada and Mexico and what it does is it kind of changes that percentage is really from NAFTA\nUnder the U.S MCA Seventy five percent of the cars value has to be made in North America that's an increase over their percentage from NAFTA and what that does is eliminate more of a cheap car parts components coming from China or South Korea or other areas of the world the other part of it is that it requires that\nThirty percent and it'll increase to forty percent eventually of the labor involved in manufacturing a car be done by people making at least sixteen dollars an hour now\nHere in this country no big deal most a auto workers make more than that anyway a buddy in Mexico it's three times the prevailing wage so what happens ah you either increase wages in Mexico or you bring those jobs back to the United states which could be a good thing I say\nCut a good thing because with increased labor cost\nAuto manufacturers may look at automating more of their production which would in the long run reduce jobs here in the United states so is it a good deal I think overall it's a good deal is it historic like the president says am not going to go that far\nUh of course the other issue too about raising the wages in Mexico or or returning those jobs to the United states is that you're going to have component parts that are now more expensive and therefore the cost of the cars go up so yeah I mean you know this is the all\nThe ... ultimately there is no free lunch somebody's going to pay for it and it's either the taxpayer the consumer all the time one hundred percent of the time\nYeah we're going to pick up the tab here car prices go up likely that automotive selection will go down\nA so it is the it is the American consumer that will pay for this now in general anytime you have a a trade agreement with your two biggest trading bloc partners combined Canada and Mexico are by far our largest trading block\nIt way bigger than China a time you have an agreement there it's good\nEspecially if it's with your neighbors to your north

on six person boards by twenty Twenty one\nWow and companies that don't comply will be hit with a fine or when\nHe signed the bill brown said quote there have been numerous objections to this villain serious legal concerns had been raised idle minimize the potential flaws that a deed they proved fatal to its ultimate implementation nevertheless recent events in Washington DC it'd be on making crystal clear that many are not\nGetting the message so in other words uh because of Brett Kavanaugh [laughter] ah\nWe are going to pass a bill that is clearly unconstitutional because it's inherently discriminatory because Kevin Affleck this pickle allegedly a a a with the uh the emphasis on allegedly\nA then therefore uh California the governor of California has signed a bill that he knows he's on ... hold on\nThat's going to stop sexual assault ...\nThe whole notion is from ... it just makes no sense at all I mean a good idea like I guess if you think about it and those fairy tale\nDoesn't even have to have legislatures are more not putting women on their board\nWell there are companies that don't have any women on their boards obviously but the idea that you're gonna have a quota says that if you have a six person board at ... must be women\nAnd in other words what you're saying is we're not you don't put the most qualified person on the board by merit and just put out the most qualified woman on the board\nWell usually the people on the board they're not qualified they know people\nThat's a different issue we can have a whole long philosophical discussion about who's on the board of all of these companies but at the bottom line is that should be up to the stock holders that should be up to the you know ultimately the investors and the equity that people will have an equity stake\nIn the company should be making that decision I Know that this is old fashioned thinking that uh you know how the ... and we've asked this question time and time again\nHow are we as a people have seeded this kind of power to our government\nThat they can simply ban legal products like for instance\nThe city of Los Angeles is gonna is on the verge of banning the sale of for the city of of LA now get I don't I I I I have no interest in articles made out of for I think that we're we're not we don't need in my opinion\nWe don't need for codes\nTo keep ourselves warm now okay there's great low ... we're not living here and we're not living you know in a in the in the great frozen north north of the wall right and this is a\nA word and I went out Cody ac alas have house with heat thank you okay what but what my personal sense of a ... animal cruelty or fashion or\nWhat I Need versus what somebody else needs should not be the determinant of what people can buy in a free society\nAnd we do this all the time we did just did it with the plastic straws we we just have somehow yielding to government at the local level\nThe ability to just tell\nPeople that they can't sell illegal product because they personally don't like it\nBecause they have they have singled out as somehow ... incentive to them ... or or a representative of some kind of a problem that they want to score some political points on so they can ballot a ban it now in this case of course it's gender equity\nAnd a and an lightened company a smart company would have done in any way is going to hire for their board of directors to manage their a corporation the best people they can find\nThe people that bring the most to the table and oftentimes the most of the table could be money frankly\nOr access to most especially when you're answering to investors evil that that means that's what the prime directive is prime directive of every corporations to turn a profit to the people who bought so I saw in the county but he bought stock in a company you don't care who sits on the board is long\nNot wanting to that's why you you you you invested in the company yes but this idea that somehow the state of California Jerry Brown knows it\nThat he literally said there have been numerous subjects is this a quote there have been numerous objections to this bill and serious legal concerns had been raised I don't minimize the potential flaws that indeed they proved fatal to adults with implementation in other words he knows this thing's dead as soon as that goes to a court but exactly this message and that's what it is fairy tale\nWorld I mean nobody was yelling and you know take Steve Jobs out of apple it needs to be a woman well and I you know what I mean he had great ideas and he ran a great company and he had things that that you know people loved and supportive but it wasn't like hey it needs to be a woman put a woman at apple\nAnd maybe if we eat alone a mosque she wouldn't have sent those crazy to eat\nSo anyway ah we'll see how long it takes a for somebody to lawyer up and sue over this when they're not going to be able to enforce this well the courts are going to reject it because it's clearly it's got discrimination baked in I mean you're basically saying\nThat by twenty Nineteen if you have a six person board a half of the board must be a female\nAnd you know how the state of California has the authority to make that mandate you know what it is this is what happens with local government when they start doing this stuff if you're a private or a business owner or a publicly traded company you have a partner\nOr the egg but the partner is the government and the partner doesn't share in any of the risk right now begun impose expenses on you and they can put all kinds of mandates on your business\nAnd if it cost of your business they're not I don't think they're not out anything yeah it doesn't cost any\nMoney and I just realized that great loophole in this entire belt because California might be for this gender equity in the boardroom but we also are a non binary states that's ... ... members can just identify\nAs women and you're good to go he hadn't\nThought about that all to work around it as a way to look at it or any other way to\nWork around that is simply a have a five person board just get rid of the six word member but still a ... it's the it's the principle of this and at what point do people finally say hey\nWho asked you who's\nEmpowered you to have this kind of authority over our lives we did\nAnyway it says six Seventeen ladies and gentlemen it's time to spend the wheel you know we spend the wheel and these health issues because we get new studies that come out all the time telling us that or something is either good or bad for us and oftentimes ah the studies can be week to week the same topic\nGoing from good the bad but this week it's an international study looking more than Seventeen thousand adolescence age nine to Nineteen from twenty tend to twenty Seventeen playing violent video games where they good or were they bad for you\n[laughter] that that that that good bad good [noise]\nIt's bad for you know it's bad for ya and or if you need exhibit a it's sitting right in there and our sports department fake news let's go find out the actual science on this KBC contributor Clinton never Clinton good morning how are you\nGuys get morning doing well this came from the national Academy of sciences and they did find that video game has caused players to become more physically aggressive this was a pretty intense study and it looked at people as you said\nFrom ages nine that night team from ...\nTo two thousand Seventeen and they found that there is increased physical aggression over time for people that play videogames frequently it came from an analysis of twenty four studies from countries like the U.S Canada Germany even Japan\nPeople that play games like call of duty and manhunt grand theft auto are more likely to exhibit behaviors like fighting or hitting a things like that as they grow up through their adolescence\nNow what's interesting about this is that we know that there's been countless studies that talk about the dissent is sensitized zing of people ah who play a lot of violent video games and of course the same thing was said about watching western swing television first showed up\nBut uh this is the first study that I Know are the first comprehensive study that I Know that actually shows a cause and effect or between people watching video games and actually acting out in some violent capacity\n[laughter] yeah that's absolutely right I mean this is evidence that shows that with people all over the country internationally at the age range of nine that night games so it's actual evidence\nThat shows that this does result in physical aggression now it doesn't go in depth as to say you know this is exactly what you're going to do or you're going to be a criminal offender or you're going to be a you know become a mass shooter or anything like that all it does it say that\nThe more off when you couldn't play video games the more at risk you are becoming physically aggressive as you grow out of your adolescent so again it's not saying that everybody that does this\nIs going to be more likely of becoming a serial killer or anything like that that just as\nIt can lead to more physical aggression\nAnd they talk about how long that these people were playing video games or was it every day or how many hours a week\nAnd you know that's the other thing that I feel like it was important that wasn't mentioned in the study is do you how often these people were playing I think that's because you know are you obviously you're more likely to become physically\nIt dirty and usually we thank you very much Doug\nI'm earning everyone a two month old boy was hospitalized today in critical condition with injuries to his face and broken bones

...\nAnd ... is the um\nThe rent control bell it's a ... it's not a secret that this market is one of the most expensive housing markets in the country\nAnd its we've covered this six ways from Sunday and it has a implications uh across the spectrum the economic spectrum from the homeless on the streets to a mansion shortage\nWe've got we are the only place in the world that actually has a mansion shortage but uh it's an enormous problem and for some people they believe that a part of the remedy is to cap the rate of growth of friends and that's what prop ten would effectively do expands local government's authority to enact rent control and residential property\nOr let's talk about a supporter let's talk about this with a supporter a spokesperson for a prop ten yes on prop ten it's a pleasure to welcome to show Damien Goodman good morning\nIt's a good man how are you\nGood morning Doug it's going to be on\nThanks for coming almost appreciate it so uh from your perspective what would prompt ten or should it be passed by the voters what would it do for a a renters in California\nWell dug it as you said you know a California is unfortunately in the midst of the nation source housing affordability and all of us just crisis it's somebody that makes us a nation to have the have the nation's highest poverty\nAway and among the things that we can do for the over Seventeen may in California is that or renter households as for why local government's inability to put a check on the skyrocketing ranch um\nWe've seen since the foreclosure crisis the global capital I'm\nReal estate interests come in and just to exploit the the market that is currently broken to gouge tenets and uh we'd like to see proposition passed so that the power to put a check on that greed put a check on a skyrocketing\nRents can be returned back to local governments\nNow a critics would say that ah that when you cap rents\nWhat you're doing is essentially tying the hands of the property owners\nAre because nobody's putting a cap on the expenses that property owners are facing local governments\nContinue I mean for instance the ... I'll just take as an example the recycling program that the city of Los Angeles just pushed through in terms of how trashes picked up from a apartment buildings\nOr it's much more expensive and that's just one of many many many examples of things where expenses go up\nAnd yet the if prop tennis in place the the owners of the property have no way of recovering those additional costs\n[laughter] well let's be clear about what ... does it simply removes that restriction that local governments have imposed upon them to adopt a\nLimits on rent increases vast majority of cities in the state of California currently don't have rent control any even after prop ... passes\nWon't have rent control but even within the current case law is what has been determined by the Supreme Court every landlord and the state of California in a jurisdiction that has rent control is guaranteed a rate of fair returns\nAnd that's further codified in the initiative that language is specifically within it so we're not talking about inability to be able to pay expenses and make a smart profit we're talking about putting a check on rent gouging taking place from saying this\nPain that's being if that's being inflicted not just at the lower end comes in income scale pushing you know service workers far out from the urban core or into poverty\nEight is six fifty talk radio seven ...

meanwhile\nSo yesterday the breathless headlines we moved away from rape an attempted rape to booze and bar fights and ice cube throwing yes there were so good in a state Supreme Court\nWe're talking about Brett Kavanaugh question by police after a bar fight in Nineteen eighty five\nWhich is by my math let's see carrying the kick off the issue here let's see get sock off these tows thirty three years\nNow I Know there's a lot of varied reporting this but apparently he was at a you'd be forty concert wow [laughter] and I thought he like beer and not red red wine\nIn a New Haven Connecticut police department report a man named\n... ... said cabinet had thrown I saw him a and Kavanaugh's friend Chris Dudley had thrown a glass that hit him in a year and that\nThe argument between the two started when a cause of Leno\nThat Brett Kavanaugh through I set up for some unknown\nReason and then he got hit in the year with a glass and\nUh we're off to the races now do you want an ice there on the Supreme Court I tell you something I could see past all the other stuff but an ice cube thrower\nThat's why I I tell ya we all have our individual lives and that for me is an absolute deal breaker Mr President withdraw this tainted nomination\nNow I Know that's a silly one but wasn't it also revealed yesterday that he was taxing people about the Deborah Ramirez story before it became public yeah so he knew about it before he said he knew about it\nThat's a problem and the the big problem here is a as we mentioned before or was he lying\nUnder oath while testified to the United States Senate ... because the booze bone is connected to the blackout bone and the blackout bone could be connected to the sexual assault bone and that's the problem\nFor Brett Kavanaugh now\nYou know he I don't know how anything would play out in these hyper partisan times but I Will say this is Brett Kavanaugh when all of this stuff first came up if Brett Kavanaugh as part of his background check had simply said look if there was a time in my life when I drank too much\nAnd I'm not proud of those days\nBut that's not the life that I mean there's no indication by the way even though he still likes beer and is on the record emphatically up still liking beer but there's no indication that as an adult a functioning adults\nIn society and in the ... the professional world who is a judge in Washington DC right there is no indication that he has had any ugly alcohol\nRelated incidents as a functioning adult ... high school and college there appears to have been lots of incidents where the

that a little bit earlier in the year they they love this kid and it really came on and you know you you concede buell are taking over the ... Shaw role when ever that day comes yup it ... it\nHas to fade into the background because this kid um he's got at all I mean his fastball about Ninety eight miles\nAn hour and he throws an array of secondary pitchers you know change ups curve balls slider all of them which\nOne of them but all of them for strikes and and that move that have AK ... and he's confident I mean pitched in the cows world search for granted built and this kid a you know a ... got a I I Would I Would go cliche audiences got ice water spraying but\nThe current age we're in you know I should say he's got like ice coconut water\n[laughter] yeah uh we're talking with Scott Miller who's the bleacher a poor columnist for ... let's take a look at some of the other teams uh the Atlanta Braves uh my cross the barest of life is that I'm a Mets fan so I watched a lot of eastern\nUh I Know I Know it's not a fair by what can I say it's just what happened to me\nUh but uh I've watched a lot of eastern division baseball this year and the Braves were a team you could see that they were a going to be good because they had a lot of young talent\nBut uh it it came together real quickly and probably a year if not two years ahead of what everybody thought\nAnd this is one of these teams where if you look at them man for man against the Dodgers the Dodgers have more depth and more talent but they're playing with house money and those were always dangerous teams to play\n[noise] yeah that's exactly right the thing with the Braves that a Dodger fans are about to see they've got two of the most exciting young players in the game right now they've got\nThose rookies Ronald ... there's going to win the rookie of the year or\nA lead off hitter outfielder a hits for power steals bags are really really exciting player and also you know one thing the Dodgers I have to watch right out of the gate of\nQunu has about twelve lead off all of this year just bull started the game with with a ... at at age were really really dangerous or the other kid as the allergies you have a\nSensational ... yeah I mean there there as I say two of the most exciting players young players in the game and then they've got a couple salty veterans Freddie free\nOf freedom is as good as I get I mean Freddie Freeman as a perennial all star and their share of veteran in the middle of that line up to balance out the youth\nAnd it's a it's a their starting pitching has good one to hotter who's been there eight years is really their number three if not number for starter now that's all you really need to know about how deep they're pitching is\nYeah that's the thing and\nYou know they've got probably their claim on start desk every pike faulty average uh but they've got yeah you're right there there was people thought they would come you know be contenders next year or the year after and that's the proverbial they arrived a year at least a year to\nThey've got a manager at a ... year old people hear his name pricey who's that guy that I studied Bryant's that are just outage that you had a you know yeah you have ... and you know so we'll see\nBut you're right under the radar Dodgers are going to be big favorites but the Braves are dangerous\nOr let's take a look at the uh the cubs and uh the Colorado game or playing into play the brewers the brewers in another team that is a dangerous in the extreme they uh they've got the best bullpen probably in the national league\nAnd that's a line up that could be charged whole bunch of different ways so whoever gets the\nHas the joy of playing them or in the wild card or whether it's Colorado or the cubs are ... sooner or later the Dodgers are going to advance gonna have to deal with uh when I Would expect would be a brewers a wind but again who knows but I I think the brewers a deeper\nYeah I totally agree I think the Dodgers and the two best teams in the national league I Would have like you just said that I Would expect that is a National League championship series but yeah I mean the night's game it's\nInteresting the or the Spanish Caesar was seven wins in a row and that's that that division title yesterday and feel the game on sixty three so they want to eat in a row ... the ... they haven't been playing badly I think they set up their final ten\nBut they're not playing as well as they were early era ... was it a VP favorite until Christian yell at you came along the last month by as is starting to look tired\nOr striking out more um the cubs bullpen ill Brandon\nMorrow who was a Dodgers a key last October each stepped into those late innings roles for the Dodgers signed with the cubs is free agent he was going to be closer\nAnd he's hurt he's out for the year their bullpen has a little shaky I'm I think is a coin flip tonight both teams are top\nThird from having to play every game I like Donnell asked her on the hill for the tribes or you know he's been there before the big games and he's got great success but you know today is the first day the cubs have not\nBeen the first place and the and also after all since July eleventh they didn't pick a good time to slide out at first class you\nKnow they didn't uh and uh\nThe uh you know Christian yell at says it certainly would be my pick if I had one for MVP up uh in the national league he's\nHe's come on as a surprise because nobody paid any attention to Miami but if you've been watching him play in Miami in the last couple years you could see this coming because even though John Carlos stat and got all the attention because all the home runs\nIn terms of contact hitter an impact player Christian yell and she was there and he's been there for years he's finally with the team wearing all came together forum and now everybody's no longer a secret\nNo you're exactly right and and um you know he's he's a ... probably is coming out party I Would say uh\nJust because he was really good in Miami but nobody pays catching as you said he was on a team usa in the world Baseball Classic two springs ago the team usa team to finally broke through and won or\nWant it for the first time and they played with air has murder end up watching the guys that yellowish ... had a really good spraying Jim Leland was managing that\nTeam it impressed them all and he stood up there in the spotlight yet he played really well ah teammates loved the is demeanor as well as his results as production and uh you know any kind of went from there to one more year gets traded\nAnd um you know the brewers acquiring him and Lorenzo Cain yep\nI'm over the winter that was a master\nStroke and then later they added like or stock is from a royal so they've got in the stock is and a\nCane they've gotta look pedigree from Kansas City royals great themes of the past few years so you know and they just ... ... ... the whole thing if if it is Dodgers Milwaukee and then I'll see us ah\nGet ready because you know this dog with everybody in LA is going to hear over and

I ... I studied hard I worked hard I played hard and that is his life story ... this is a guy who's grades were superb his academic achievement was excellent he was an athlete a ... he worked hard on the sports field not and he partied hard\nGoes I don't do that anymore and I haven't done that for many many years there's no indication that alcohol has impacted negatively Brett Kavanaugh's life as an adult\nSnowy respect reformed alcoholic and drug addicts George W. Bush became president well\nHe doesn't even if he doesn't even have to admit that he was an alcoholic because then you would have to say why do you still light beer what are you still dream fear there's no indication that alcohol has impacted Brett Kavanaugh's life as an adult until it became a point of inquiry in the confirmation process\nAnd now it's causing all kinds of problems for him because his critics believe that the booze bone is connected to the blackout bone and the blackout bone is connected to the sexual assault allegation\nAnd I think a lot of people are coming forward now the people that we keep hearing about well I went to jail with him and I'm mad that I saw him sit there and say oh I didn't really drink that much or I wasn't really a party or when they witness women have to come out and say no that's just not true\nAnd this is the problem because if you're not telling the truth about that right then it opens the ... the doors are they ... that you are and telling the truth about about what do you know for whatever it's\nNot telling the truth about isn't it automatic disqualify but somebody that wants to be a Supreme Court justice is perjuring himself and doesn't respect the oh well that's why\nThat's why it's significant that's why it's significant that these incidents that seem on the surface the you know bar fight in New Haven Connecticut thirty three years ago while in college\nIs trivial but what's not trivial is the lack of candor under oath yeah that's the problem that's what God Bill Clinton impeached\nIs that he uh he perjured himself and some born perjury [noise]\nPolice are expected to announce arrest today and a string of high profile celebrity burglaries and the Hollywood Hills area\nRecent victims have included athletes Robert Woods ...

Bush certainly implied\nThat he had a serious drinking problem and that it was interfering in his life he was arrested for DUI as we know in the eighties and uh\nAnd that he put the plug in the job and he hasn't touched that sense you know a ... and and he he makes no bones about he has talked about a conversion that that how faith helped him a a you know live a different life than he was leading\nA so uh again once a person we are enormously forgiving of people who are a substance abusers and then they clean up their act were enormously forgiving of substance abuser so we're still suffering for that matter in\nA it's so ... so you know at Brett Kavanaugh\nAre taken a different tact on this then I I think that he could have put this fire out a lot quicker and then if people came up with story after story after story wouldn't matter because she's the one who's in jail and this is the way you know I've already told you that uh I don't deny that at all of those things could have happened\n... looks like you know sexual allegations inside it looks like he lied under oath is\nThat's right and that's a problem that's a real problem that's what got Bill Clinton impeached\nSo we'll see where it plays out a there's a couple more days of the clock is still taking I still think it's highly likely that Brett Kavanaugh gets confirmed but the bottom line is is that it's a tragedy that we're going to have a justice on the Supreme Court with so many people in the country\nA ... ... ... you know moving him vilify him in fact a you know so over the top that he's being described in social media by one Georgetown University professor as a serial rapist as a serial rapist\nAnd it's like wow man we're just ... yeah\nAll right ah ladies and gentlemen or there was a major piece of legislation signed by Governor Brown and of course he signed you've got to carpal tunnel from all the things that he signed vetoed but this one is really kind of amazing because Governor Brown in his\nSigning ceremony seemed to acknowledge that the bill mandating that women be uh on the boards of directors of California corporations have by twenty Twenty one if you have a six member board half of the board must be a comprised of women\nThe governor acknowledged that the bill is seriously flawed and and with flaws that could quote proved fatal to its ultimate implementation he signed it anyway or general because you'd report on one of the shrimp\nGood morning he really sinus as a sort of a a\nA statement because he also said it's high time corporate boards include the people who constitute more than half the person's in America that would be women and are headed jacks and the Democratic senator in Sacramento said that you know we hold up half the sky so we should have some say\nWomen are the are Seventy percent of consumers out there so if we're buying out there and we should have a say in what goes on in there\nSo that's pretty much what this was all about but as you say this was another\nMore of a symbolic signing up for a law just like the Internet the or the net neutrality of bill which I think is also going to prove to be fatal a but this is something that the governor went ahead and signed I I personally thought he would veto it because those concerns of equal protection\nOr civil rights laws in both us and the California Constitution\nAre pretty bright so he but he signed it anyway [noise]\nAh you know ... the question is how aggressively or they're going to defend it because it's expensive and you know\nA murder suspect led police on of pursuit Monday Night before the chase ended with a carjacking and the crash\nA possible murder suspect led police on a high speed chase on Monday Night that started and ended in North Hollywood with a brief excursion into Burbank\nDuring the pursuit the driver letters to passengers out of the car and one was quickly taken into custody the driver later abandoned the car and carjacked an SUV which he crashed head on into a police cruiser on ... avenue and was taken into custody a second passenger remains at large I'm Jeff ...
