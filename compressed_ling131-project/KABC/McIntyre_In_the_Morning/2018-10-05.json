that you want to pay and we've\nTalked about that say you know Doug in a long season and last year remember\nThey were expected to win the world series they won so many games and it was like Dodgers they're gonna when everybody was like doctors are going to win the world series is is there year they're winning they're good they're the best team in baseball and look what happened I mean they made it to games have another world series but it just was the expectations were on them and if you look at this season\nThey they were hot they were called that a lot of injuries and sort of they they

pushing back against the allegations are the accusation that his anger angry demeanor\nAnd a finger pointing at the Democrats during the black sea Ford testimony disqualifies him from the bench on Tempe on temperament grounds and biased against Democrats\n... ... and he acknowledged that maybe I was too emotional but he basically was doubling down on I Will be a a a fair play it down the middle judge\nAnd then speaking of judges retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is in his late nineties now\nAre breaking his silence and saying I I now believe that because of the temperament issue that we saw during those hearings that Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be confirmed which is very unusual for a former Supreme Court judge to weigh in on this\nAnd that seems to be what stand at least at this point the the op ed written by judge Kavanaugh when you add this this judge in in or justice rather Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens had not only had wonderful things to say about judge Kavanaugh's legal work he took some of the judge Kavanaugh's decision put them into books he was writing and he said that the that we're\nHaving a one of the best legal minds out that the problem that he had though\nDidn't come up until you saw him sitting down Brett Kavanaugh sitting down in front of the Senate Judiciary committee and giving his testimony that level of a summer saying extreme partisan bias disrespect towards other members of the committee in this particular case a Justice Stevens says listen to it was the performance\nDuring the hearing it makes me question if he's got the ability to sit on the Supreme Court and again reiterating he's a great judicial line but he just doesn't have\nThat ability to sit there and be either impartial or certainly has a calmness that you would need to have is a Supreme Court justice and again like you mentioned this from a Ninety eight year old Supreme Court justice that Democrats are going to point to today heavily\nWell isn't this guy knows what it takes to be a Supreme Court justice and he says Kavanaugh doesn't have it\nWell it's certainly to say the least it's gonna be fascinating to watch a ... how this plays out one one last question actually Michael 'cause you're on the ground there are there's a lot of protesters in DC\nUh and and they're really really worked in themselves into a frenzy over this it it almost looks like we can see a repeat\nOf the Trump ... violence in Washington I'm not rooting for that uh bought it really does look like people love amp themselves up and coming in from out of town prepared for some kind of display of something\nYeah and there's been a lot of social media buzz about that as well and then invites people telling people where these different events are going to be held and marches are going to be held I agree with you would look like it could be set up for that now we saw the three hundred people arrested yesterday including ... uh at this cat the capital here but that said\nI don't know that it's going to get to that level I think the protest will be there I think the bodies will be there we're seeing that\nThere's this morning walking in with a with pro me two shirts and and and believe her shirts and those kinds of things so I think there's going to be statements made I don't know that we're going to see that kind of level of violence but certainly that level of appearance and certainly that level for the march is going to be high today\nAll right a Michael thank you so much appreciate it Michael by our NBC News in Washington appreciate your being literally a weekend at\nEight hundred to two two KBC folks if you want to join us again we do encourage you are to jump on board here and uh\nThe vote again is at seven thirty this morning and it's not the confirmation vote it's just part of the process to get us to the confirmation vote now Jeff Flake is going to be a fascinating person to watching this because he has already demonstrated that he is\nPersuadable or by an oral arguments that two women who confronted him in the elevator but a week ago ...\nEssentially a changed his vote for me yes for cabinet to a conditional yes and I got here condition being the FBI investigation they might be taking the stairs today a that's possible but what he's also going to have to listen to is there going to end debate but there will be debate\nSo are the arguments that are coming in against this nomination and for it or could be determinant of how Jeff Flake ends up voting ultimately the one that was I think the toughest decision to make his Joe Manchin the Democrat from West Virginia\nWho are of course he's got a D. next to his name but he represents one of the blue is the ... to be read as the red states\nAnd uh you know it was one of President Trump's favorite places to visit because he's got all those coal miners in a is a state that went a whole hog for Donald Trump yeah uh and as a dependable Republican state but Joe Manchin has been able to thread the\nNeedle because he is by far one of the most conservative Democrats in the United States Senate\nOr and if he votes for Brett Kavanaugh\nOr his party is going to be furious if he votes against him his constituents are going to be furious he's screwed either way well yes and no I ... I I Do have a thought on this\nAnd he has one option and I think the Democrats are aware of this and this is why he gets treated with a certain amount of kid gloves because they need him in the caucus to if they have any chance of taking the Senate\nOr the option he has is switching parties and running as a Republican and if Joe Manchin votes for Brett Kavanaugh and flipped parties and ran as a Republican he'd win easily in fact he might win with a bigger margin and we've seen that happen before we've seen senators\nAnd that won't happen anymore yeah too good to be true when warehouse workers got hired at Amazon they got two shares of Amazon stock that are worth about two thousand and peas and then if you don't call in sick and you fill your quotas every month you got bonuses that's all gone so this race could end up costing\nThe money I'm like oh this is why you can ...\nLatest gentleman at six thirty\nHeadlines some land please and\nThank you very much Doug among every one several key Republican senators are undecided on judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination as the Senate is\nPoised to take a crucial vote this morning on whether to advance it and the gal Marquette reports at least one democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia is also seen as a swing vote\nThese votes with Donald Trump more than any other of democratic senator and he has also been a thorn in the side to the president and things like health care and the tax bill for instance\nDowntown Los Angeles is experiencing an outbreak of ...\nThe electronic department of public health announced Thursday that a vote type is normally occur throughout LA county several cases have occurred in the downtown Los Angeles area visuals are encouraging pet owners to practice safely controlling or recommending that all cities in the county\nEnsure the maintenance of their trash clean up and wrote in Detroit but he's ... is a disease that infected fleas can spread to humans Rob ... bc news\nSeptember jobs numbers are out Christine Romans has the numbers\nAnother strong land for the labor market and I want to give you this number for the unemployment rate three point seven percent that is the lowest unemployment rate since Nineteen sixty nine\nIt's the longest streak of hiring on record since the great recession shut night is going to spend nearly three decades in prison on manslaughter charges\nJudge Ronald ... the former ram mogul to twenty eight years for the twenty Fifteen hit and run death of a man he addressed the victim's family directly\nFueling or if you let me tell you\nHeart goes all night and\nPleaded no contest days before his trial was set to begin he faced a one count of murder and one count of attempted murder after he ran over to men with his truck during a confrontation he is an eligible for probation James Rojas KBC new\nIs this an OJ kind of situation where he's getting a bigger sentence because people think he killed Tupac\nHe murdered dude with his truck and ran ran over and now you have any ... any only got Twenty years come on now he ... to protest I think he should have gotten life but anyways KBC news time is six\nThirty three but four big Dodger new and here's Randy to tell you about it well first\nLet me get my sports spot in this check a sports bras you buy him a current inspections dot com look at the Dodgers go\nAnother lead off home run from Jack Peterson is that like eight of them this season already a three run home run from ...

radio rated right here on TALK radio seven ... she with ...\nLou how are you\nA great ... welcome aboard sure happy to have you so we were talking earlier because we've had this nasty a story that a flea born type is has come to LA because of the homeless epidemic and people have been racking their brains for solutions are\nEven band aids to deal with this problem the latest census says this fifty seven thousand seven hundred Ninety four people\nAnd counting sleeping on the streets every night in LA this is just the city by the way and one of the suggestions is to take those giant metal containers that you see coming into the ports and harbors and then end up in the back of Eighteen wheelers\nAnd do something called cargo texture and people you know convert these things into everything from bomb shelters to you know a kiosk to actual residences and what does that involve\nYeah in New York City there are full on office buildings that they have a they have constructed we did a couple of stories about it for a TV show probably about a couple of years ago\nSo huge trend um these containers are we all have seen them right and you drive along the port and you'll see thousands of them stacked on top of each other and they're the super strong\nRectangular metal boxes and they have been converted to a myriad of different things and from a from a standpoint of affordable housing it has a lot of merit because they're waterproof\nYou do have to do some modification obviously to make a door on it because they just have large doors you could drive a forklift into but literally they can hold tens of thousands of pounds as these cranes lift them up and because they're so dirty\nIt has merit meant you know they're typically eight feet wide they're uh they're ten feet long twenty feet long the big ones are forty foot long\nI guess the question becomes building the home part of it Doug is not the issue that is easy you can go on a website um Estee you know that website you can buy a home right now for Fifteen grand with your visa\nMade out of one of those home wow and literally and have it delivered to your house you know we we um we did a story on the radio show a few weeks ago about this whole auxiliary or accessory a building I think we may have spoken about it on on your show dog where people are you know building\nA ... other dwelling on their own property right at the rent\nRomantic flats or the ... the movement for she sheds or ... after I built a small a hundred and twenty square foot office in my backyard\nA that was a prefab building it was from a company called studio shed and I love it absolutely love it but now these things are they obviously don't have any installation and have drywall they don't have plumbing they don't have air conditioning they don't have ventilation and\nEasy that is so easy I mean it really is because of the size of it Doug I mean the the the building the home part of it's the easy part the real question is where do you put them\nYeah where do we put them in a way that it doesn't look like I mean affordable housing and homelessness problem is a huge issue we have the ability to solve this if\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... thinks Tucker Carlson giving them\nNew I I get that but to the point is is that as an institution they don't blur that line uh and that that people that's not the case of an MSNBC and it's not the case on CNN\nBut uh when you know when you're not even making a pretense when you have one of your principal actors\nAs certainly make a definitive statement that Donald Trump inherited a quote unquote booming economy from Brock Obama that's debatable it was a recovering economy and it was a consummate heading in the right direction

Bush ... notoriously nominated Harriet Miers his personal attorney to the Supreme Court\nAnd and within minutes even Bush supporters were saying why [laughter] and she eventually was ruined her own name from contention just because it had become a national embarrassment she was not deemed worthy\nSo that the important point here is that the Senate has rejected candidates\nFor ... reasons or let's put it this way I shouldn't say could preaches for a a partisan reasons they simply didn't like\nThe nominee because they felt that that person was to India logically leaning one way or another had some blemish that they found objectionable and just to give somebody else and it's not uncommon\nBut well I haven't yet so I you know when when Louis Brandeis was nominated for the court there was a great deal of anti Semitism his nomination was held up for a long period of time when Abe Fortas was nominated to the court there were battles because his close relationship with Lyndon Johnson\nA and because he um he had arguably a relationship with a man who had some tax problems that was that was being litigated in the federal courts but I'm probably the most damaging thing for Ford is was that\nAh when he was a nominated when he was elevated from the ... a position that associate justice to become chief justice\nI'm a senator Strom Thurmond claimed that Ford is a supported a liberalizing of uh pornography laws and in order to make his point more vividly um Strom Thurmond arranged for viewing a pornographic movies in the basement of the Congress\nAnd they never had a such a good attendance for a Senate\nHearing of everyone who is a shame to\nSee it just just what exactly was that for this would have tried to legalize so hard for this\nFor this had to withdraw from his um a nomination to be chief justice and that it created that they can see that led to a warrant burger becoming chief justice so you know they've been very nasty battles I personally as you may know Doug\nWas involved with the ... Thomas hearings and uh you know that was another very nasty battle but it wasn't the beginning of the of the war at all\nYou know this has been going on for a long time\nAnd you know this is kind of of just a sidebar but a ... the ranking member\nOf the United States Supreme court right now meaning the longest serving member the United States Supreme court is Clarence Thomas ... Clarence Thomas but on the court longer than any of the other justices or serving we're talking with Joan Richard Paul whose book is called without precedent chief justice John Marshall in his times\nWhere do you think this has been my concern about this whole process but the the current one that's before the country that are ... I expect Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed who knows you know they still have to vote in the wee hours\nA ... but I don't know which is in college it's going to do right\nNow so it might not happen bought for the purpose of conversation he gets confirmed\nAnd now we have two of nine members of the Supreme Court who have a a cloud over their heads with enormous percentage of the country believing that they committed sexual improprieties a Kavanaugh's the allegations are very serious\nBut the ... the Supreme Court doesn't have a police force that doesn't have an army it has its moral authority and it seems to me that we're really de legitimizing the court ... significant stuff that this is not some minor detail that\nSo that's exactly right I you know that it's it's it's amazing to me uh that is is shooting for a moment if we can\nThat I'm a Brett Kavanaugh is innocent and has been unfairly accused if that were true if I were him I Would be demanding a much more thorough investigation\nSay an ad from the one I was I Would I Would just put out there I Would refuse to take a seat on the court until my name was clear\nBecause because ... if if that's true of this woman should be put in jail for for ... for lying to Congress\nAnd the other women who ... you know should be put in jail and you know and and ah his name should be cleared but if that's not true I ... we have this enormous cloud over the court and affects not just him for the entire court and then the statements he made when he was attacking\nThe Democrats on the committee looks terrible for the court a show many organizations and and so many parties that will come before the court in the future\nUm if Kavanaugh is sitting on the court he will have to recuse himself from those hearings because he has\nA a you know she has condemned this poses a conspiracy against him led by liberals and liberal interest groups and the Democrats and the Clintons and I don't know who else so it's just it's a terrible way for him to enter the court\nWell a perfect example would be it let's say we have another electoral college dust up like we had in two thousand Bush versus Gore\nAnd makes its way to the Supreme Court you have one of the judges sitting on justice is sitting on the Supreme Court who has a clear ah axe to grind begins the left and the Democratic party he said as much a Senate bluntly and that's a real problem I this\nIs when you have a judge or a conservative distinguished judge like Justice Stevens coming out and opposing his nomination to the court um that's a real estate I mean that Justice Stevens is is such a circumspect conservative guy\nFor ... is a man who still whereas bow ties a ... for him to come out are opposed to Brett Kavanaugh this way I'm a is a real warning sign that that the court may be in trouble\nOr let me ask you just uh to balance this uh Ruth Bader Ginsburg who's been turned into a pop culture a hike on hot [laughter] you know a year or so ago she went off the reservation and my last to Donald Trump\nCompletely inappropriate you know it was it was completely inappropriate for her to make those statements and shit\nAll the judge for the later

government to make traffic worst essentially to punish you for driving you're single a passenger vehicle\nUh and this included of course we learned about this over a mar vista\nOver here of Venice Boulevard where lanes were taken away in a cause real blow back in the neighborhood uh we wanted to update you aware of this uh stands and joining us from the keep LA moving a movement is John Russo John welcome back to show a war you\nKnow great the great things or have meal and get those applauded\nThe hero well appreciate it now we know that uh the irony is is that a year and a half in or two years into this uh a roll out of this program pedestrian deaths are up significantly in the city of Los Angeles\nA part of that obviously in my opinion is based on what we gave a million drivers licenses to people in the country illegally\nAnd and if you give a million people driver's licenses you put a million more drivers on the road and just demographics would indicate that you're going to have more uh collisions but above and beyond that it certainly doesn't seem like the steps of the city claimed we're going to make our roads safer have done so\nI mean if you're exactly right if you look at the statistics of the last uh what is it fourteen years or ... flat line for eleven years and then twenty Fifteen they instituted in zero and then we've seen an eighty percent spike since then um so clearly the measures they're taking are not working\nAnd and as you mentioned on Venice Boulevard and it's just been an an absolute disaster down there or you know you were there a little over a year ago you're broadcasting from the sky\nAnd since then or since the road I was implemented in May of last year Fifteen businesses closed their doors on Venice Boulevard some are gone for good or never to come back at some of relocated um and in fact the river on the street is that ... are you how old you are broadcast is actually on the ropes and they may be gone\nAnd just a few weeks after after twelve years Thirteen Years on this boulevard they may be closing their doors now because you know they not only is traffic and redirected but we redirected the customers and when you don't have customers coming through your doors anymore uh it's kinda hard to stay in business\nOr talk to us about uh the great street program 'cause you see this is the other problem there's all these various programs so ... you know it's like whack a mole when you try to get a handle on what's being done he said well that's not vision zero that's great streets and if you go read\nIt they got the right they have very very many names for all these programs and played all re here they call it the the streets were ... ... the great streets program which is actually rolling out on fourteen streets across Los Angeles uh and then they have vision zero programs and they have safety pilot projects but they're all the same thing\nThey're all a an attempt to create traffic or make traffic worse and and basically try and forced you out of your car and and then they\nThey are um you know our government's not talking to us or not or communicating what's going on than not communicating their plans with the community and in fact we have a government now where if you don't agree with them watch that they're not just not listening to their constituents their flight out at luring you pretending like you don't exist\nWell uh this is where the dismal voter turnout a comes back to haunt us because when you don't have to fear or any consequences at the polls\nThen you can pretty much do what you want and that's essentially what's happened\nIn the city of Los Angeles I mean I was pointing out that Eric Garcetti was reelected with eighty one percent of the vote which is a very impressive number\nBut what's not impressive as there was only twenty percent voter turnout so he got eighty one percent of a tiny number of voters and you know the two things grow in darkness mushrooms and corruption\n[laughter] yeah we're I think we're definitely seeing both of those Los Angeles now I mean you make a great point on and says the same thing he whenever we he gets a little below the crows that I Will I receive Seventy percent of the vote but with such low turnout he actually received eleven percent of the vote of eligible voters in his district so it's not quite the mandate that he says he has\nNo but it's better than what the opposition has put up and that's that's the problem is that you know we can complain about it all we want but the bottom line is they won the election uh and there are people showed up\nAnd a lot of people who complain about these issues when it comes to local elections they yawn and they skip them and that's it and then we end up with is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty\nYears of ... anyway the bottom line is I digress the reason I tell that the jury tale from the past is that is how serious a problem\nA human waste can be in terms of uh the health risk\nDisease outbreak and and you know if we've got garbage and you've got ... fifty seven thousand people all going to use the official number even though nobody knows alone on a number let's just use that what he got fifty seven thousand people who are deprecating in public spaces and the potential for\nAn epidemic breaking out is essentially its its Vegas wouldn't give you any points on it because it's a certainty\nThis thing can spread real quick and his doctor drew was said since April warning about this this could be the next play\nAh what's described as very similar to the bubonic plague which was split spread by fleas on rats\nSo what's happening on ... happening here and it's going to remain until we can solve the a ... that's far in solvable problem the two fold problem we have to have\nThe law passed a constitutional challenge that allows local governments to remove people forcibly from the streets against their will for their own good and the good of the community and we have to have a place for them to go\nAnd that's neither one of those are easy 'cause I don't know how you pat write a law that passes a constitutional challenge on those points and I don't know where you're going to put fifty seven thousand plus people who need everything\nIncluding drug and alcohol and mental health counseling [noise]\nA man who was abused as a child by Catholic priests has announced a lawsuit filed in LA against the Vatican seeking the

Catholic Church could come up with this been going on for decades and arguably for centuries\nSo uh you know Jesus said I Believe it was Jesus said rent a rent a seizure that which is seizures well the ah is in the courts are part of the process of civil government\nAnd uh I'm Glad to see that the victims are using the courts to bring a first of all the trends parents who have been promised for

they have spies planted a up and down in academia or industry and in politics undoubtedly so\nAh so that that doesn't surprise me what the only thing that's surprising about it is that we're now actually talking about it\nOr with all the focus that's been on Russia or\nYou know and they're still should be focused on route meddling too yeah I'm not only am I Star Wars review [laughter]\nAnd uh you know look it's not it's not even just Russia and China or espionage is as old as ... government itself\nSo are you know we've had allies that are spying on as the Israeli government was spying on us so so that's a you know look it happens\nAnd we do it too by the way we are not our hands aren't totally clean air either but um you know it's it's the executive branch's obligation to preserve protect and defend so when you find out that a nation is doing this it's a important to push back against ... remember we were\nHacking into angle of Merkel's cellphone spying on our closest allies so that's one of the reasons why we don't get a lot of people around the world are rallying to say oh yeah poured America because they know we've been doing it to everybody's doing it so this is a tough

what will Susan Collins choose to do she she voted for cloture meaning she voted to advance the actual vote on Brett Kavanaugh but she's supposed to have a press conference at noon\nWhere she's going to make some kind of an announcement we know Lisa Murkowski voted against cloture it's very hard to see how she votes against cloture and then flip some votes for Brett Kavanaugh\nQuite does so we we know what her votes going to be and uh Joe Manchin of West Virginia who voted a balanced drop by going ahead and voting with the with the Republicans on the procedural vote\nYou know I've looked at the numbers um there's been plenty of polling in West Virginia a as to his popularity if he votes one way and if he votes the other and I have to tell ya based on the polling that we've seen if he votes against this nomination of Brett Kavanaugh he's toast or and\nSo you know that's quite a possibility I think I'm\nA it'll be interesting to see what Jeff Flake has you know\nIt was going to do this and have to face re election but he does have to have a fully we assume me as a political career a there have been talks about him being a a rival to Donald Trump and the and the Republican primary\nAnd the next presidential term so uh so yeah it's anybody's guess and as you've been pointing out the fact that they voted for the the the cloture and the procedural effort to get this to a

let's go to\nI I say something and it's something that they put a fork in the idea that conservatives and Republicans are the party of fiscal responsibility that's gone that is gone any Donald Trump doesn't care about that\nAnd in the house in the Senate members don't care we voted we've seen budgets come through on Donald Trump's watch that are ... ad a trillion dollars to the deficit every time they they send another piece of paper across but\nI think Larry but but I'm Still personally like Larry as where a lot of personal responsibility and not overstepping means and stuff like that so yes the party is still it is going that direction and and that makes me angry\nThat I grew up fiscally conservative and that makes me angry that the party is like that so maybe as a whole the party is going that direction but I Can't get mad at Larry for he still living like that and I know a lot of people\nIn my ... I Can't extrapolate that it means anything political you know I I realize that but you can't just say just because the parties going that direction that people aren't still living like that in their personal lives in a field that is true for liberals as well I I haven't been learning our lives within their own so\nNot not not everyone and not not everybody that's the Republican I don't know what I'm saying that the vast majority of human beings have to live within their means not everyone's not everyone does\nA lot of people I Know we're all in credit card debt but plus the American way I understand the statute of limitations runs out and you're good to go dead beat John in the ... job welcome aboard how're ya\nYour morning guys ah yeah I Would I Would definitely vote for Kavanaugh due to the fact that I have not seen one credible piece of evidence and all this talk in all this\nIs going on for what three weeks now I haven't seen one credible piece of evidence that saw here say it's all you know it's all talk\nWell it certainly there's nothing that's been presented to the country that would that would stand up in court for five seconds\nWas the same as as the Russian collusion thing I've it's been going on for two years and I haven't seen one piece of evidence on\nThat well that's because we haven't seen any evidence on that we don't have the Malay hard so I'm way too willing to wait to see what they present so but in terms of\nThe cabinet case if this was\nA a trial if this was a courtroom trial I I ... I don't believe the prosecutors would have even brought charges I you know we've had a lot of these sexual assault\nAllegations against the show business people that the LA a district attorney's office has chosen not to file charges because they say it's either pass the statute of limitation of why we don't have enough meat on the bones here to\nBring this to him and that's what a lot of people were saying was fined signed the reason why she held the letters because there was nothing really she thought could be done about it because there was no real way to prove it or not\nSo so another yes vote for Kavanaugh are in are highly unscientific all eight hundred to two two KBC if you would like to join us we're at ... an hour well a that's a there's going to be a a a much closer to that in the United states\nJanet I'm going to have my announcement on how I'll be voting at noon today uh we're\n... why don't you do it while we're on the air here will save that for the end let's go see a little Elizabeth in Los Angeles Elizabeth welcome aboard how're ya mining\nGood morning I'm I'm a big no judge Kavanaugh okay and why would that mean long before the disgrace and the dog and pony show that has been the last few weeks which really at stake quite embarrassing I think I'm just ideologically opposed to like a lot of the things he believes\nA totally legitimate I mean that yes I totally get that I mean ... judge Kavanaugh is likely\nOr a vote to overturn roe versus Wade ... he he may even be a vote to overturn gay marriage there may be a lot of things\nThat aren't on constitutional grounds he would vote away a in a way that would ah disturb to say the least them a amusing I'm I'm a modest phrase of people on the left\nA and social libertarians by the way not just on the left I Know a lot of people who vote Republican who are sort of on social issues are libertarians yeah and they don't want to see those things overturned either but nonetheless\nHe's likely to be a vote in that direction so as we had a conversation earlier I don't know if you've got to hear this we had joined Richard Paul on who's a a a Supreme Court\nAnd uh if he's not the mayor and he's not the man who's going to bring on her to the bench\nAll right we've got you down as a no vote right now and are highly unscientific poll we've got for us is into knows for Brett Kavanaugh of course our votes don't matter the Senate does there'll be voting in the wee small hours thanks for the call Nick appreciate them drawing hold hang on we'll get more calls on board eight hundred to two to\n...
