pay\nAnd so you don't go to the front desk or anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tip\nAnd there'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call it which is the goal of all businesses that people out of more money Seinfeld I explained to her I said so you know you're married you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old\nLittle pictures up there the kids you know and you know and they're

Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent at thirty percent\nSee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out\nShe goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty per se but she isn't that different though because of that industry has a history of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on the screen so when you're a bone marrow\nDo you tip yeah really I Do that they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay here's the reason why\nGay many many moons ago I worked at Houlahan which was a bar like Houston right and and\nWhen you wait tables and I also waited tables I when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work\nThat somebody that I understand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target\nWould you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want to\nPut a bad but at ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said\nIn and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean

really nice should be maybe in the low seventies um but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nNow let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband had just because we have to honor\nThat and they uh they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is healthy with us\n... five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we call her car\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you get this way everybody has the picture and\nUm I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are or right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we are in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's an adventure in what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year\nWhen we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have from it and you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator Airbus and if you decided to die\nWhen we got to Wisconsin that I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and the RV places are few and far between up there\nSo a systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got\nSome help from our forum friends that are out there are kind of doing the same thing we're doing um the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how did we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so\nUh the last we heard a was that we have to take off the side when does\nIt take off and have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window I'm\nShort generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your mother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change them I ... back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it off it was\nIt was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator\n[laughter] gosh we go out to dinner practically every week [laughter]\nNice All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to loosen up because how has a technical question and I bet you you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah basically what happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early days ventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see what we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F.

some bulbs Eli de floods spotlights flexible lighting stripped outdoor garden lights and you see the here's the thing is that they come with their own apps that you can program all that\nIt also works with Amazon election that Google Assistant and also apples home kit there's also the smart put gardens find many don't worry about writing this down we have some more information over a commander dot com\nBut then you're going to need to think I'm all up and then you're going to need to add some spooky sounds and so that's very few labs\nIt has Halloween living scenes and she will Halloween which is an avid issue haunted house those are some uh lighting and music app so there are ways that you can still step up to a game\nAnd get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nKill good to talk to you thanks so much for your call today so it was going on I Would go to a small theater group so we put on three plays a year that I live in an old movie theatre here in ... and oh how cool is that\nIt's all it does have a good ... on the toll loses a a week of peace to search to call the tractors to all these people and we get a look at people and so we got the keys floating\nAll [laughter] that's all over the county everybody's got to get\nEverybody's got to the key to this place but\nWe were having a hard time\nOur idea is to one of the doors we would like to put like a digital tart law\nSure that we can program with toads and give the boats out now is the truth lots of ... automatically slows or twenty four dollars or ... or ... or whatever is needed for that and the second to it is\nA light or a little due to to a program like the on site but it was a cook clear but all such such nobody\nWill stop it all the time\nRight well we don't live on you know the good news is is that the technology exists\nThe even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use in K also and so when you buy the smarter block is that a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have on a a ... house that I own\nIs that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay\nAnd so when somebody books through ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say this law is going to work on this Saturday from eleven AM next Wednesday at Fort Pierre okay\nAnd you put the person's name in there and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program this right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock\nIf you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles or something called the August ... and the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet and\nIs it you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things hub or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to fix am when nobody's there so at least illuminate maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hubs Charlie is what I'm saying is that once you get the hub you start thinking about OK what more can I add to that right\nDo a little drive home of horrors lived for ... days Halloween parade crops nobody\nRomney Nineteen ruin that had\nEver all three hours

going on well I have a\nQuestion uh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have a a website that I have one phone line right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I'd been toying with the idea of putting a check a function I'm not sure what you'd call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you or you know is it\nAre easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as employment of people to support that are the questions or what have you\nAlways awful yeah oh really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we were deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\n[noise] well I Would say I have to have some of them play so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have a\nA a employ individuals to support the ah the ... function and how that would work as they would give me dirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them then those are the three questions I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have to ask the question though she they had the the canned to answer that I've already given\nBut of course I Do as soon as you look at those dirty question\nYeah and I got and here's the reason why I'm hesitating fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we I we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our business is that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right so so\nI Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact to getting\nThe same question time and time again of which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on but I think\nYou'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert\nTo a a paying client because\nThey are going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building for you\nA yes or the the we do have a website it's already been billed than we have another company building or another website all over again but but when we have a third tempting as calling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters seem kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under FA cues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening and chats and box and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad the staff here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow

to be a high resistance circuit\nFrom the battery to the ground and from the and the hot side or the bowl was actually rusted and a threat it hold it went into was arrested also once I cleaned all that out my problem went away\nGot a good connection there that's part of the connection there like a corrosion would do the same thing Russ would do the same thing [noise] anything that would cause a bad but I don't know that would cause it to run\nDown and uh and\nI think his problem is that that sets for three days the battery would go dead and now in your situation it would work sometimes you wouldn't start and then you'd clean the cable and moving and now suddenly start up and get a connection there\nThought well\nIf it's a high resistance circuit it's going to take a while you days before the battery depletes the note which are the batteries and recharge to the point where he can start to a vehicle that was about to put my head anyway it was it took about three days for for the depletion to her\nWell it certainly certainly a a very good to answer that it could be a connection problem but you know shows a discharging okayed fourteen afternoon when you've got a bad connection to the show that is charging that high but you're absolutely right it's very good that that could possibly happen any time you have a poor connection\nAnd sometimes when they hooked to a grand cable up as hooked up in the wrong a position to get hooked up where maybe there's some a rubber insulation is something where it doesn't get a good connection\nIt's got to have a good ground all battery has got to have a good ... good positive and a good negative said electric has got to circulate one hundred percent and make everything A L connections must be good let me just say that\nYou're absolutely right I agree and I thank\nYou John for the call I appreciate that God Bless you my friend in fact you God Bless you two\nPacks a it's good to have our listeners help out with the show is
