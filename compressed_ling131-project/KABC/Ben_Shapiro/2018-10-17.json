other narrative of the day that Elizabeth Warren as Tom do is not actually Native American so she claimed that she was Native American and many many many many many times she claimed that she was Native American in legal journals she claimed that she was Native American and the war in that you won't University of Pennsylvania law school\nShe claimed that she was Native American in a story that you told over and over and over romantic story Romeo and Juliet story about her mother\nA Native American proud Native American woman wandering the plane who met her father and her father brought her home but the inlaws were racist racist and said you can't bring home that Native American woman you can't bring home that\nThat Indian get out of here and then apparently her parents he looked and they had a a beautiful romance from there on it well it turns out that Elizabeth Warren is not in fact Native American but it was funny to watch the narrative turned yesterday so yesterday Elizabeth Warren started this whole thing off\nBy releasing a video of her and her family members talking to her Native American she was and here was what the video sounded like\nThis isn't just about casual racism or who\nNeeded communities have faced discrimination neglected in violence for generations and Trump can say whatever he wants to be mocking Native Americans were any you were to try to get his knees [noise]\nSome people question my heritage and my family history\nThey do which was so\nMaybe they do is to distract from\n'cause they think politics one [noise]\nMy parents were real people\nLove their shoes struggles me into his family they\nTore the will always be people [noise]\nWorry is ...\nHard edged on her heart and then she goes to all her family members were talking about their Native American heritage and\nThen she released as they study and the study showed that she was one maybe maybe not totally maybe one one thousand twenty four native I'm sure it one one thousand twenty fourth Native American which is just awesome it's just awesome in every way so surely did that\nAnd watches her tweet evolved over the course of the day to she starts off by saying this by the way a real Donald Trump remember staying on seven ... if you give a million dollars to charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry I remember and here's the verdict please send the check the national indigenous women's resource center\nIn number one that's how he said what he said if you prove your Native American and then I'll give you a million bucks in Rogers Native American to prove that she is wider than any person decided mark and mark\nAnd then she continued tweeting but watch out to eat them up and I W RCs nonprofit working to protect native women from violence more than half ball native women have experienced sexual violence and majority of violent crimes against Native Americans are perpetrated by non native send them you're one million dollar check Donald Trump\nAnd then she continues along these lines I took the test and released the results for anyone who cares to see because I've got nothing to hide what are you hiding Donald Trump release her tax returns or the Democratic led house will do it for you soon enough tick tock Mr President though there's one most annoying things on Twitter these days the tick tock\nReveal we'll talk more chicken down to something that or it turns don't we're ticking down to you completely collapsing in on yourself like a dying star she continues\nAnd she says having memory problems Donald Trump should we call for a doctor there are some people will forget Mr President you're the least popular president in modern history in your allies will go down hard in mid term election twenty two days tick tock tick tock uh okay and then she could but\nThen she concludes\nI won't sit quietly for Donald Trump's races and so I took a pet but\nDNA and family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship which is determined to only only by tribal nations I respected ascension and don't let myself as native in the Senate\nWhat happened like that I mean that was a sudden western\nIs like when Michael Scott was driving on the road in his UPS holding to drive into the lake that's basically how that we read one he's just he's talking she's talking about yeah I'm a Native American and

well it turns out to try to get to decide who's Native American why why because\nThe Cherokee Nation came out and said oh you're not Native American\n... supposed to be clear about this the Cherokee Nation does not come out and make political statements very often but they found out there secretary of state truck hocking to issue a statement he said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA test you're not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous north or South America sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and well DNA tests can be used a determined lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nAnd then they continue using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's legitimate uses well also dishonor in legitimate tribal government and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and his heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continue claimed to travel heritage\nOuch ouch\nSo she just got limited by the Cherokee Nation which she claims ancestral membership\nYeah that went poorly furloughs before which is why she shipped into it I'm not claiming that I'm Native American anymore but I kind of Native American will give me a million dollars again I call on the Trump Administration I call him President Trump personally signed a nine hundred dollar check to Elizabeth Warren's charity of choice because\nShe was one one thousand twelve people were Native American maybe you should pay one one one thousand twenty fourth of a million dollars out of the amount to which she wrote to President Trump was asked about this yesterday and he basically just missed all of it\n\nYou're better read it again [noise] I Hope\nVery easy I O\nF F years running [noise] I Do\nYou'll make got

Patrick Cory Booker returns will Elizabeth Warren and suggest that\nElizabeth Warren basically traded on fake\nMinority heritage in order to try and score points with minority ... it's going to hurt her pretty badly Elizabeth lord actually damage herself pretty significantly but\nThat was basically inevitable because you're stuck between a rock and a hard place she's just a white woman running at a party that doesn't care about white one and thinks that white women are part of the patriarchy\nAnd she also can't claim minority status because if she does she's one\nOf those ... shot herself in the foot in a pretty significant way here and I'm not sure that she recovers because honesty was not a priority me well she's not the only Democrat in turmoil story out today President Trump has raised already for his reelection one hundred million dollars in fundraising for his reelection\nIt's only twenty eight team according to run which times the British times President Trump has tapped a hundred million dollars in fundraising for his twenty twenty reelection bid an enormous hall for president barely two years into his first term according to new figures reported by his twenty twenty campaign\nFrom pulled in more than Eighteen million dollars last quarter through his campaign committee and to joint fundraising committees with the currency for a total of at least a hundred and six million since January Seventeen twenty Seventeen according to his campaign and federal filing so that's bad news for Democrats who thought that Trump would have collapsed at this point that he would've destroyed themself by this point\nFrom campus for himself because\nNothing you can destroy a man who has no character character in American politics is no longer a major concern obviously and so Trump can raise as much money as he want meanwhile Democrats in Senate races across the country\nAre having trouble to they don't all Rourke\nActing on the best ideals of his Democratic spread the wealth around campaign he announced on Monday he is not going to share any of his thirty eight million dollar war chest you know democratic bosses want the cash for more competitive states obeyed or rocket will lose the Ted Cruz in Texas in the Senate race latest polls have him down almost double digit after\nThe media have been falling over him to stay where they found over Wendy Davis\nThe former state senator in Texas who then lost by something like twenty points to Greg Abbott\nAnd now they're for governor in Texas they're doing the same thing with ... the Texas Democrat told reporters after a campaign rally he will not there any expense and his own re he plans we've all the money he has raised out on the field the head of election day\nO'Rourke raised from July to September thirty eight point one million dollars\nHe says that he is going to he's not going to contribute any of that money to other candidates which is kind of amazing because honestly if he wants to ensure his future and the Democratic party he really should become a patron of yards right who should be taking that money and distributing it more hotly contested races he's not going to do any of that so that's a bad story for Democrats meaning meanwhile\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe the kind of\nUndercover journalist\nRight there were shocked or list over a project very tough you've done some good work before he sent his workers indecent some his folks into Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she is campaigning parts of the right where she actually is on the issues here some of what that sounded like", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "station": "KABC", "day": "17", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
