American stories and listen to all the way we do go to our American network dot org that's our American network dot org\nOur American stories brought to you by NPR [noise]\nGet your shot at one

Angeles\nOrange County of cumulus station [noise] talk\nRadio seven Ninety KABC news alive in local at nine o'clock on Joe Myers a federal investigation is under way into the suspicious packages with explosive devices sent to high profile Democrats and CNN Today on the east and west coast\nThat a lot of that is springing from\nA basic failure of values and the basic failure values is something that we call and Hebrew there's a there's a ... commandment yours\nThose do consider everybody in their best possible way that they keep a French word has done the cost of ... which literally means that you're supposed to think of everybody's marriage\nWe don't do that anymore we tend to instead think of everybody's ... we tend to think of the worst form of everybody's arguments we tend to think the worst motives\nOn the part of people with whom we disagree with someone say something in the first thing we think is not okay what's the reasonable explanation for what they're saying or what maybe were they thinking and said we immediately jumped to this person is the worst person in the world and the rhetoric is obviously intended for ... for the worst possible that now\nI Can't say I've been innocent in this because I don't think anybody in politics is innocent and that but I Do think that we're going to have to start trying to attribute to people perhaps a less\nUh less vicious motive and we have been attributing to them so far because people hate each other and not because of what they do but because of what they think they are and they think the other person is thinking that's where we are in American society\nIs one thing that hate another person because of something that they do or they name somebody murders your father you're allowed to hate them but what we have come to in society is action that can be interpreted in a couple of ways and we have decided to interpret them in the least flattering most nasty way about somebody else\nTo take an example there's a religious Baker in Colorado He says listen\nDon't want to bake a cake for cake for same sex wedding because I Believe that homosexuality is simple we immediately attribute that to malice we immediately attribute that to that because the bakeries a mean man who hates gay people never mind the Baker's been serving gay couples for years in his cabinet and he's just saying I don't want to be\nRoped or hamstrung into violating my own religious precepts no we have to attribute him hatred we have to attribute team viciousness and we see that\nOn the other side as well and there are folks on the left will say things like well I won't nationalized healthcare\nAnd instead of us saying on the right well maybe they won't nationalized healthcare because they don't understand the issue or because they misunderstand how nationalized healthcare works or because they have a good faith argument about how we should redistribute resources instead we go to is because they won't control\nIs because they won't control once you start explaining people's motives without reference to the actual behavior\nYou're going to get yourself into hot water politically entertainment divide the country on a more significant among laughing level and yet this is also here's the problem this is also the stuff that wins the election the stuff that wins elections in today's society\nIs castigate in your opponent is morally somehow deficient thing that your opponent is not just wrong the evil you'll Ronald Reagan was famous for saying that it isn't that Democrats\nAre are just are evil it that they know so much that isn't so in other words he attributed to ignorance what he could not attribute Tim Allen and it's it's just it's a rule that I've had on the program tried to attribute to stupidity what you can't sit for the smells\nBut when it comes to political fight the easiest thing to do is a tribute malice to the other side\nAnd you've seen as manifest in a couple of different ways let's say for example the way that the left has decided to read President Trump's comments about nationalism for the president of the United states give his speech a couple of days ago in which he was talking about illegal immigration\nAnd President Trump is no stranger to character attacks or uses them on a fairly frequent basis against is lyrical opponents whether they're former opponents like Ted Cruz or whether they are opponents in the Democratic party why because the fact that it's a lot more effective to attack somebody character than to attack their ideas because\nWe tend to vote based on whether we think somebody is a good person or not not based on whether we believe their ideas are good\nHe evaluating ideas takes time and effort evaluating ideas requires you to actually sit there and determine whether you think that the evidence is there to support particular idea but evaluating human being you can do like that\nAnd science tends to show that that's exactly how we deal with other human beings in our daily life and in politics more broadly when you meet somebody\nYou tend to make a judgment about that person within the first five seconds of meeting them whether you think this is a good person or a bad person the nice person or a mean person a person who you think is going to benefit your life or a person who's going to be a detriment to like to make that decision and second there's a lot easier and a lot more instinctive human brain is built for that\nRather than thinking through okay what are the policies at this politician is suggesting\nWe as a society need to start thinking about the policy is a lot more and stop attributing motives so much but\nAgain it is easier and more\n... lucrative to suggest evil motive on the part of people the face down character attacked are deeply effective I wrote an entire book about that in two thousand Thirteen called bullies and the entire premise and book that basically the lesson decided to leave\nIdea arguments outside the realm of the norm and instead have decided to attack on a character basis everybody on the right to Lloyd's example here's President Trump a couple of days ago saying that he's a national is not a global now even implicit in this comment by President Trump\nIs a character attack on the left the character attack on the left as the people in the United states who disagree with him about immigration actually don't care about the United states for that sort of implicit in what President Trump is saying but\nThe real point he's making is that his priorities\nAre the protection of the American people above all else and other priorities such as for example kindness or human rights those take second priority to protection of the nation's borders maybe for human rights reasons maybe for charitable reasons but that's the way he thinks that things were going to see in a second what President Trump that\nBut first let's talk about your underwear dudes fault is here and as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade a restock your drawers with drawers\nAlmost fall colors print from Tommy John Tommy John obsesses over every little detail in such by using proprietary fabric to perform like nothing you've ever worn before as a result how many times men and women's underwear square to know what you're guaranteed comfortable staple waistband a range of fabric that are luxury at least off by the light moisture within reasonable designed to move with you\nNot against you that means no bunting know riding up Tommy John so confident in their underwear and if you don't love your first pair you can get a full refund with their best Perry will ever where or it's free guarantee so what have you got to lose\nThat includes the new life changing women's underwear now fully back in a hurry over to Tommy John dot com right now and use ... for twenty percent off your first order that's probably could have been for twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com before you spend another dime on cheap heat trapping multi back under where there is a better way\nTommy John no just needed again Tommy John dot com you promote Ben you get twenty percent off I Love my Tommy John on where you will to Tommy John dot\nCom here's President Trump talking about nationalism and then we'll look at the Democratic response because this is driving up the temperature again it's not unique to inside I keep repeating that because I think it's important there's a chart I talked about on this program I think a couple of weeks ago when we were in when we were in Memphis\nThat showed the level of hatred within each party for the other party has been rising consistently for years but it is sky rocketed among Republican and it and it can here's President Trump talking about nationalism then you're going to see the sort of failure of that\nJewish friends was talking about down the costs because the the idea of trying to think of people that's possible that you're gonna see how Democrats responded by like that brings up here's President Trump\nThat wants to love to do well\nFrankly not caring about our country so much [noise]\nAnd you know what we can have that\nYou know the word it's sort of became old fashion it's a national issue\nNot supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist\nYou hear these sort of implicit character attack President Trump is no leveling and folks on the left there but he's not actually saying something racist you know what I'm saying something Texas are begging and here he is saying that some people have a priority which is to uplift\nPlaces in the world they're not the United states that's not my priority now you can say that President Trump is from ending his opposition I think that's a fair critique\nThe way Democrats reacted was by doubling down on the line and so they say that when President Trump says nationalist what he really means is that he has a racist here's Joe Biden\nRemember Joe Biden that guy who was at John McCain's funeral calling for a new better politics Joe Biden the guys and the John McCain and I we got along we're best friends because we never question one another's motive here was Joe Biden\nAt a rally last night suggesting that Donald Trump is like George Wallace in actual segregationist go by the way I was a Democrat and therefore it's probably closer to Joe Biden and Donald Trump in any case there is Joe Biden saying that Trump is like George Wallace thanks than the nationalism common\nNew fridge should remove [laughter]\nWe can do to review ... like George George Bush you [laughter]\nOkay I mean that is about as ... statement you can make about another human being as possible and then\nThe White House they're really trying to separate the president from anything you do when these attacks we've seen that multiple times is that most of all from White House officials saying the president\nHas nothing to do it if they are trying to put as much distance between that as they can\nGeoff Wardle reports of white nationalist from Huntington Beach will remain in federal custody for allegedly inciting

disclosure I'm friends with making Kelly I think to making Kelly is really nice lady uh I I was I used to be a regular guest on her Fox News show and she was on Fox News\nAnd I wish her nothing but about Megan got herself into hot water because she was on yesterday an NBC News and they were doing ... stuff\nAnd what was the soft up they were doing it was the NBC morning show all the stuff that they were doing was they were talking about Halloween costumes well there's always gets into dicey areas because as soon as you start talking about limits on Halloween costumes and what should be allowed and what shouldn't be allowed people get very easily offended by Halloween costumes\nAnd the point where people on the left have been suggesting in recent years a white girl shouldn't be able to dress up as mulatto for Halloween\nAnd talked about last Halloween it's just idiocy it's just ... my daughter is going to dress up as any Disney Princess you've chosen by making ... a pretty broad territory here because she's talking about the use of of dressing up as black folks\nFor Halloween and whether you can put on black makeup dressing as a black person for Halloween you here's what making have to say and this goes to the central contention and making today which is that people are jumping the worst possible conclusion about people's motives without actually analyzing what the motives are so here is making talking about\nHalloween costumes involving putting on black makeup or darkening your skin for a costume and the blowback was just enormous\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on all the way for a black person it puts on white the Alawite like that that was a kid that was okay as long as you were dressing up as like a character\nOkay so she got an all sorts of trouble because when I was a kid was okay to dress up as they enter Iraq has been Diana Ross and then my neighborhood and somebody darken skins what what Diana Ross because if you just put on a ... a you know ... to look like the Enron people still don't know who you are seeing dark and your skin or whatever so\nPeople are nuts over that this is Megan Kelly being ignorant\nAnd bigoted and races and so making Kelly actually had to issue an apology here's what you said\nYour friends and teammates one of the wonderful things about my job is that I get the chance to express and hear a lot of opinion today is one of those days were listening carefully to other points of view including from friends and colleagues winning me to rethink my own even when we had the roundtable discussion earlier today about the controversy of making her faith look like a different\nRace a part of a Halloween costume I suggested that this seemed okay if done as part of this holiday or people have the chance to make themselves look like others yeah conduct Diana Ross came up as an example\nI Would it be controversial for someone dressing up as Diana Ross make yourself look like this amazing woman as a way of honoring and respecting her I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong and I'm Sorry the history of blackface in our culture is important the wounds duty I've never been a PC kind of person but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age\nParticularly on race and ethnicity issues which far from being held have been exacerbated in our politics over the past year is it time for more understanding loves sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that I look forward to continuing the discussion I'm honored to work with all of you every day\nMaking so I think her apology is perfectly appropriate by the way but the outsized reactions were original comment is pretty astonishing so here was cursing powers which supposedly is in favor of people say what they want freedom of speech here's what she tweeted you're white people who are upset that you can dress up as another race or culture for Halloween your feelings don't matter\nThe only feeling that matter are those who feel disrespected or mosque by you appropriating their culture for entertainment show some common decency\nSo basically the feelings of people who are non white matter more than the people on the feelings and people who are white\nNow I think that there is some actual nuance to this issue here isn't wants to this issue\nBlackface has a long terrible history in the United states had people actually wrapping up as black folks in order to mock them with something that happened on a frequent basis all the way up till the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties in the United states and you can go back and you can watch videos on YouTube of people dressing up\nAt ... doing ... put making their faces black and giving themselves big lip in really really racist fashion and then singing Miami songs in order to mock lactose\nAnd it's very much the same thing as an anti Semitic cultures for centuries where people would put on a hook knows I and they and they put on a fake belly and currently sidewalks and then they would suggest that they were Jewish right I mean it it's the same sort of thing like dressing up as a culture to mock that culture is disgusting unacceptable actually ration\nNow is that will make until it was interesting\nThis is what we're getting to the issue of assuming people's motives\nHere's my opinion on people darkening their face for costumes like that I agree that it's inappropriate specifically because of the past and I think that it is fair for people to look at this sort of thing and be sensitive about it but I think it would also be worthwhile to recognize there is a difference between being ignorant slash racially insensitive and being racist\nNowhere was making Kelly suggesting that black people should be mocked\nNo or was making Kelly suggesting that black people are in your in any way in fact and making Kelly was interesting that maybe why people want to dress up as some famous black people because they admire those famous black people that is not the same thing and people dressing up in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a frat party dressed as a black person with black makeup on\nMe that's insensitive and you should take into account black people's feelings about historic use of this sort of costuming her mockery but",
