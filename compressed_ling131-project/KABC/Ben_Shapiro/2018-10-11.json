I'm a wet out in public and made excuses for rioting in Ferguson and Baltimore but I'm not sure what Hillary Clinton is talking about when she says the era of civility is over but here's Hillary Clinton saying we don't need to be civil anymore because we disagree with Republicans and why would you be civil with people with whom you disagree\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again [laughter] victory\nCivility civility can start again when we dominate you and put our boots on your throat that's when civility makes a comeback now what's funny about that is that her premise that you can't be civil to a party that wants to destroy all the things that you stand for that's the premise of party politics in the United states there's not a lot unifying the Democratic and Republican parties right now\nThey both want to destroy what the other party stands for that is not remove the requirement to be civil\nNow I think Republicans understand is much better than Democrats do or at least did until twenty sixteen\nThe great untold story of less twenty five years is that Democrats categorized every Republican as evil and nasty and bigoted and homophobic and racist and all of these terrible things and finally Republicans responded and twenty sixteen by saying you know what\nScrew you two were done and I have a ... to ... so here's a chart from Jonathan heights new book about polarization in American politics and here's what it shows it's partisan hatred for the other party\nAnd you'll see that the lighter line if you're watching is usually the lighter line shows that you like to folks who hate the Democratic Party Republicans who hate the Democratic party and the darker line shows Democrats who hate the Republican Party what you will see is that until twenty sixteen\nDemocratic hate for the Republican Party was higher or equal to hate from Republicans for Democrats every year since Nineteen eighty\nLike that's the actual trend line here what you see in this trend line is it since Nineteen eighty when Ronald Reagan won election democratic hatred for the Republican Party skyrocketed and was significantly higher\nThan Republican hatred for the Democrats all the way up until Nineteen Ninety five or so then they sort of drew eating and they basically are right on top of each other and then after George W. Bush was elected than democratic hatred for the Republican Party skyrocket again and remain higher this is the practice amazing it remain higher than hatred\nFor the Democratic party by Republicans all the way until twenty sixteen which means even after ... rock Obama was elected Democrats still hated Republicans more than Republicans hated Democrats which shows you that Republicans in the end really believe I think\n... they believe and heavily this for for decades that Democrats are wrong but not evil and Democrats believe that Republicans are both wrong and evil\nAnd in twenty sixteen Republicans finally said listen you guys think that we're evil well that makes you evil we're done with it or you're going to say that you hate us just for partisan reasons will we hate you write that you can go shove it you're not interested in playing this game with you anymore\nThat's what's happened so the media only noticed that surrounds twenty sixteen because the media are ... and Democrats the folks in the media only noticed that Republican hatred for Democrats have skyrocketed in twenty sixteen because for the first time that was evident that that was the case\nBecause until then democratic hatred for Republicans always had exceeded Republican hatred for Democrats and the media were part of that problem the media we're forwarding that hatred the media were cheering it on who's the media declaring the George W. Bush was a war criminal was the media declaring that the Tea Party were a bunch of terrorists is the media declaring that the that the Tea Party were a bunch of\nMobs ... fans\nLike this was this was their claim and then in twenty sixteen Republicans won\nPartially by saying okay fine we will activate the hatred within right they'll fall for the ... in in return to the jet I\nWould love to hate flew through loss and you can make us powerful and to a certain extent you did Democrats thinking that they are going to somehow when by escalating the amount of hatred in their hearts again\nIs a
