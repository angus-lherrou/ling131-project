and a privileged kids from ... if he wanted to and yeah yeah yeah yeah I think it's kinda cool yeah\nStill anti Semitic attacks have occurred in the LA Jewish community since I was a child in Nineteen Ninety One at synagogue down the block from me was firebombed in Nineteen Ninety nine a white supremacist drove past the high school that I Would attend a year later\nChecked it out and then proceeded to drive over to the west valley Jaycee and shoot it up in two thousand to a radical Muslim terrorists walk in the ...\nCounter at LAX and shot up yellow accounts are killing a member of my community when I tend to be sure the University of high school was Angeles we had bomb scares bomb threats maybe every three months we'd have to evacuate the school so anti Semitism particularly from white supremacist is nothing new here\nSo this brings us to the bigger question they did this brings it to the bigger question and that is why this thing happened right now now I'm not going to mention the name of it shouldn't be said don't mention the name of terrorists or measures on the program I don't want to give them any sort of Lori this mass shooter\nUse a little known social network has few hatred towards Jews he called them the children of Satan as he showed off his family of firearms you know facing the death penalty after unleashing the gun on worshippers at the tree of life synagogue\nHe was particularly upset about ... a Jewish nonprofit providing aid to refugees or the Jewish nonprofit\nIs a is called highest and he tweeted highest likes to bringing invaders they kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get water screw your optics I'm going in those last week that he sent before he went and murdered a bunch of Jews most of them over the age fifty including a Holocaust survivor he\nAlso had a particular dislike for President Trump he dismissed President Trump as a global is rather than ... national as you said there is no matter as long as there is a hike infestation 'em to use the word here because I think it's imperative to know the language that these these monsters use evil evil people\nSo that the media to take on all of this has been\nQuite simplistic and foolish or they have of course ingested that President Trump is responsible for everything President Trump is responsible for the shooting ... specifically because President Trump in two thousand sixteen two thousand Seventeen winter not at at the alt right\nNow I was highly critical of President Trump for doing that I Am highly critical of President Trump for doing that I was the number one target of All right anti Semitism on line two thousand sixteen with bullet it was not close forty percent ... anti Semitic tweets by the alt right in two thousand sixteen were directed at me personally\nIf I'm well acquainted with the folks that President Trump went to not at this guy was not right he was a white supremacist there is a slight difference is not a member of the modern alt right movement which is discussing an evil in anti Semitic enough itself but\nHe is a white supremacist with with a longer standing pass\nBecause of this is a complex topic going to try to parse it I'm gonna try to parse this because they bunch of things can be true all at once\nNumber one just said last week with regard to the attempted bombing against democratic target as I said that\nYou cannot connect it politicians rhetoric say violent action unless he politician actually calls for the violent action President Trump has engaged in nothing even remotely approaching incitement against you know one can him a single comment that he's ever made that looks like incitement against Jews in fact as president of the United states has been extraordinarily pro Israel and pro Jewish\nAnd the president comment in response to this particular anti Semitic attacks were far stronger than his predecessors responses to similar anti Semitic attacks for example here's what the president to the United states had to say\nThan the after this clip Fifteen is what the president had to say in the aftermath of the attack\nYour school boards of anti Semitism cannot be sure to not be tolerated and it could not be allowed to continue with general though it's a ... [noise]\nIt must be confronted and you're damned everywhere it rears its very ugly head [noise]\nWe're ... or Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat and ...\nAnd very where's the forces of age as what it is\nOkay so his his statement that anti Semitism must be eradicated it was a far stronger statement them rock Obama sweet so here's what ... and I want to say the contrast between this because\nAgain if we're going to talk about standing with the Jews and we have to talk about who's response to this has happened actually better President Trump's that it was better than Obama's hearing here was Obama's respond simpler we agree for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh all of us have to fight the rise in anti Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those look lover pray differently and we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocence get their hands on a gun\nPresident Trump took on anti Semitism why point is an anti Semitism is evil and must be eradicated he didn't try to like in ... hatred against any other group you didn't try to make about gun control ... both of those things the left has a tendency to obscure anti Semitism with the broad brush 'em bigotry simply saying that anti Semitism is like any other hatred it is not like any other hatred every hatred\nHas its own diagnosis every hatred has don't symptom anti black racism is not the same as anti white racism\nAnti black racism is not the same thing as anti Semitism anti L G BP homophobia is not the same thing as anti Semitism rock Obama simply wants to push a progressive agenda and don't eat lumps in anti Semitism with all other forms of hatred that an inaccurate and that is true and it does have some consequences when it comes to policy\nNow let's go through some of the elements here that I think are important personal as I say\nPresident Trump in two thousand sixteen two thousand Seventeen did Lincoln not if you All right okay again I've said this a thousand times I wrote editorials without it I was extraordinarily vocal about it\nFrom his willingness to condemn David Duke on CNN does unwillingness to condemn all like a tax on July ... D GQ journalist will get you on a second\nTo bringing on Steve Bannon who called himself the progenitor of the Web site that was it became a a gathering place for the all right\nPresident Trump Lincoln not that I Know this because I think in the target of the alt right from statements in the aftermath of Charlottesville providing aid and comfort to white supremacist I don't see any way around that\nBut Trump is not a white supremacist and he is not an anti Semite he has a pathological\nAversion to criticizing anyone who says anything nice about him point number two there's a bunch of things that are true at the same time and if you want to understand what's going on we need to recognize that point number two white supremacist them is not All right mad that they are not the same category of people white supremacists long predated President Trump they're not a new development\nThose people were going to shoot Jews regardless of what anybody had to say because they had been shooting Jews\nSince long before I was born\nIn Nineteen Ninety nine as I mentioned it white supremacist shut up our local Jaycee that same year six Orthodox Jews were shot in Chicago along with a black man and several Asians by white supremacists the sort of stuff has been happening for a very long time it has nothing to do with President Trump\nThird President Trump has separate from the alt right in dramatic ways\nHate to say that President Trump is still associated with the alt right in the ignorance of President Trump's administration or what he has done the alt right is enraged with him if you go look at Richard Spencer if you go look at at some of the other members of the all right they are angry at him they believe that he has been hijacked by the global it\nHad the same way that the shooter about that President Trump was standing up too much for the hikes\nAnd so that is the way that that that that is just a basic truth President Trump has been extraordinarily pro Jewish and pro Israel in his actual presidency\nThat is a basic foundational than if you fail to acknowledge it your lying by omission\nHay in a second I'm gonna get to a few more points we have to keep in mind that we'll get to the media's response which again I think is simplistic despicable and partisan but first let's talk about your underwear so do follow this year as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade or restock their drawers with drawers with all fall colors in print from Tommy John\nTommy John obsesses over every little detail in

don't wear out easily they don't\nWrite up on ya that Tommy John dot com you probably could have been for twenty percent off\nOkay a few more points that we have to keep in mind with regard to the shooting in Pennsylvania and what it has to do with President Trump which is to say very little\nPresident from they say that separated from the alt right in dramatic way so the first three point that I've made here President Trump did wake and not be All right for two years to white supremacist I'm not the same result right mega three President Trump is separated from the ... right in dramatic way
