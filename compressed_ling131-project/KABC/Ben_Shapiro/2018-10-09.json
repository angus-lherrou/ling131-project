actually feel these days so points for honesty\nAnd then you have these these comedians who decided they were going to follow around Brian kilometer Brian is legitimately one of the nicest people in

states of America My state New York\nWell what a delight and there's Kirsten Gillibrand your real feminists standing up there with Amy Schumer as a woman who talked about the great paid maternity leave in Saudi Arabia inferred [laughter]\nA good stuff there from the Democratic party President Trump is correct that the Democrats have indeed turned into an angry mob and you can see how much ... they've turned into when we get to what policies they are proposing because it's pretty astonishing but here's President Trump hitting the nail on the head as I've said before the president is hammer sometimes you hit the nail sometimes he has a baby well\nYesterday yet and they'll and it was satisfied because he said what is correct here the the only thing Democrats had to do honestly when Trump was elected all Democrats had to do was not be crazy\nThat's all they had to do they have failed dramatically in that task of not being crazy instead they've decided to go full blown crazy here as President Trump pointing that out\nThere was for power the radical Democrats have turned to an angry mob you saw that today were screaming and shouting not from\nHundred people more or less that weren't you know what those people they could fit in the front row what we have here [noise]\n[noise] okay Trump is exactly right about all this now what are the left one of the sudden look forward to about this well they want to do two things one they want to come up with systemic ways to change the system and to they want to try it out a war on women narrative the Warren lemme narrative is they're great hope that they can start a war of the sexes they try this and twenty sixteen\nThey said that there was a war on women and Hillary Clinton was representative of women in this fight they're hoping that because President Trump is alienating too a lot of particularly suburban women that they can go on to that and then they can combine that with\nEnthusiasm for the me too movement and use that to a club Republicans into submission on a political level will get to the war on women narrative in a second but first what they want to do is they want you radically change the system of American government\nThey're full blown members of the medium talking about Washington Post reporters today or shocked shocked to discover that the Senate of the United states is not represented by population\nThey're shocked to discover that in fact each state has two senators and then they realized that weight Montana has fewer people than New York which means the Senate isn't representative oh my God they're they're literally ... and it's like right now\nIs it [laughter] I don't know what were they been for the past three hundred years in this country but yeah I mean this is actually a case that they are making\nRight now we'll get to all of that in just one second but first I'd like to take a moment to remind you there's a whole other world to this radio show at daily wire dot com

few things that they are upset about so after twenty sixteen they discovered they didn't like the electoral college very much because\nHillary lost and now they've discovered that there is such a thing called the United States Senate\nAnd at the United States Senate believe it or not actually represents a different population than the house of representatives now originally the constitution said that the Senate was not even to be selected by popular vote within the states originally the state legislature selected their own senators which was\nThe correct move and that's the way it should have worked because that meant that there was even another layer between the population and the Senate and the founders were actually quite worried about my rule there are quite worried about the idea of democracy because they figured that demagoguery could win over broad swaths of the population and that would enable all sorts of bad things to happen to minorities inside the United states\nIs what they're worried about so they set up a system of checks and balances to provide for the rights of state well ensuring that if there was overwhelming support for a measure that all of that would be able to happen anyway\nBut Aaron Blake over at the Washington Post and shocking news breaking news you the senior political reporter at the Washington Post this is breaking news guys\nHot off the wires quote people are suddenly deciding the population disparities render the Senate undemocratic upon ratification Virginia had twelve times many people's Delaware disparities are bigger now but they very much existing when our founders decided on the system so Aaron Blake\nIs a and Blake is is obviously you know actually saying the truth here but there are a bunch of people in the media who have been suddenly calling on folks to get rid of the Senate I'm not kidding theirs but I'm I'm looking for all the tweets right now the basically they're making the case that the Senate needs to go away\nOr alternatively there making the case instead that the that the Supreme Court ought to be packed so my favorite is Democrats suggesting that Republicans on democratically got Brett Kavanaugh through the Senate when Republicans had the votes in the Senate\nSomehow it's undemocratic and now they're saying they're solution to the ... democratic nature of the movement of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court requires them to add more justices to the Supreme Court in violation of the constitution\nIs from New York Times today the bitter partisan theory that engulfed justice Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation was the fiercest battle in a political war over the judiciary that has been steadily intensifying since the Senate rejected judge Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven but\nAn even greater conflagration maybe coming this confirmation but well not necessarily be the last word on Brett Kavanaugh\nSeveral a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court to Brian Fallon executive director of the liberal group demand justice and the top spokesman for Hillary twenty sixteen campaign so what exactly are they talking about some have gone as far as proposing if

the United States Senate is controlled by Republicans have decided Senate is bad I I Love this will lead Shahid who is a writer for Cynthia Nixon he did comes in policy for Cynthia Nixon he said the Senate is undemocratic and it matters\nAlex Alex McGill is is a reporter for ProPublica reporter saying the undemocratic nature of representation in the Senate is unlikely to be remedied anytime soon\nThe job everybody okay so back to this war on women narrative that that you left describing out this is best exemplified by a woman named Alexis Cornell she's written on gender in politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets so she was a professional useless person and she writes a piece today that is titled white women come and get your people\nThey will defend their privilege to the death so what I like about that is that now the less it's not just attacking may not just war between women and men now it's a war between intersection analogy groups so it's black women versus white women and Hispanics verses women versus wetland because it turns out\nWhite women largely sided with Brett Kavanaugh white women vote Republican more often because it turned out a lot of women actually think individually\nWomen don't always think like the left wants them to say which is fine and good I thought the whole point of feminism as you get what you want to think\nAnd not according to the feminine care is this insane to I mean this is fully crazy this is like get the butterfly net and straight jacket stuff here is what here's what Alexis Grinnell right now in keeping with the the\nModerate tone of the Democrats lately after a confirmation process where women all the clip their wrists letting their stories of sexual from a rotten like rumors of broad\nThrough the capital the Senate still vote it's confirmed judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with the exception of Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska all the women in the Republican conference cage including Senator Susan Collins of Maine who held out until the bitter end\nAll but what they are is letting their stories and sexual trauma run like ... through the capital I wasn't aware that screaming at people was\nA necessity hating factor in them agreeing with you and if you screaming people about your experiences that have nothing to do it for a cabinet Brett Kavanaugh is guilty\nBut life is going to drop the hammer these women are gender freighters to borrow a turtle from the dystopian TV series The Handmaid's tale first of all I think we ought to have a new role and there's a rule on the Internet uh and uh about\nOr I'm trying member of the the rule about using Hitler on the Internet what what's it called um there there is an actual name for it that the goblins law so it's called God when while they're basically the longer and Internet argument goes on the more likely somebody is going to drop Hitler in the middle of the arguments well\nThe same thing now holds true for The Handmaid's tale called Shapiro's law the longer any argument goes on with the left\nThe the more of an opportunity left is going to have to drop a reference to Handmaid's Tale it most overrated book of last half century\nAnd a series that has become popular largely because the media have decided\nThat is deeply important for women to believe that they are on the verge of being sexually enslaved by men in a society where fewer women than ever in American history are getting married in which women are waiting longer to get married having fewer children and having a job and having more more income from jobs in than any time in American history but women or disclose\nTheir disclose it Mike Pence has his way we're going to stick those women in those red brick ... and we're going to just gonna send and we're going to force them to reproduce with us that's what we're going to do it if Mike Pence has his way that evil evil Mike Pence\nSo here's what elections when I read these women are gender for tourists to borrow a term from the still getting TV series The Handmaid's tale they've made standing by the patriarchy a full time job the women who support them show up at the Capitol where women for cabinet T shirt but also probably tell their daughters to put on less revealing clothes when they go out\nWho they tell their daughter is not to address all\nSkimpy ooh\nThat means that they're bad mom's the best moms tell their daughters to go out in the streets naked that's the best moms do I love at first of all I I just have to stop right there\nThis notion that if you tell your daughter not to dress Kimberly because you should respect herself more than that at this makes you a bad parent or restrictive parents is utterly insane it's utterly insane only somebody who has never really raise children in any serious capacity could thinks this or\nMaybe if you think there's a ... like maybe a different strategy may maybe I don't know about electric grid also Trish maybe she has maybe she has get maybe maybe I Will say is that it is a bad strategy to send your teenage girl to a high school and her Brian panties had just going to just going to say it's a bad idea\nAnd it doesn't make you a bad parents ... means they are trying to protect your daughter from the fact that there are dangerous people in the world and also because maybe your daughter doesn't want to look like a sex object all the time\nAnd she doesn't want to portray herself to sex object I like how the feminist movement move from the correct opinion about pornography that pornography was a justification of women for the pleasure of men to pornography is empowerment of women\nYeah I'm sure that all those men who are in their basements right now watching Stormy Daniels old tapes are thinking about the empowerment of women they're all feminists that's what they're thinking right now", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "station": "KABC", "day": "09", "state": "CA", "year":
