{"content": "And it is really that change we're in the enlightenment when suddenly people say wait a second actually we almost don't know anything everything we have to learn that is really what caused you know all these enormous change in the beginning of modern science modern art and all that\nAnd talk about the unlike ... if you can because there were many challenges to many institutions because of the enlightenment and in the end curiosity can be dangerous to regimes\nYou write a C ... various oppressive regimes\nA fight it I think more convenient for people to be less curious and ask questions and you know you might think that they see something that oh well maybe you know in the middle ages and things like these uh but you see these today I mean you you know you have regimes you know such as the Taliban\nOh you know they destroyed the Buddhas of Bamiyan this enormous you know a hundred feet statues that existed you know since the ... century or you know they show up in the head that young Pakistani girl you know my like yourself say\nA because she advocated education for young girls are so you see even today you know these attempts to suppress curiosity and end the move to enlightenment is really when you realize that you should let your curiosity be free\nOne I think that that gets to the larger point curiosity is power in the end and and power ... Gen generally feels threatened by curiosity\nYou're right I mean at least there are such such powers that feel threatened by the city because it sometimes\nEasier to uh you you know especially when when for for oppressive regimes you know it's easier to control people when they don't don't know things rather than you know going the other way and for the regime to become more enlightened\nIndeed and I think the second you start to ask even why of government and that becomes a dangerous question even that kind of curiosity or wants to be suppressed by certain types of dictatorships and we've learned this throughout history what happens when you when you deny people their curiosity in the end of the regime suffer\nIt's not even in their interest is it to suppress the curiosity of your own people\nIn the long term of course it isn't I mean because those those kind of society a stay at the end you know they could behind in terms of for development in terms of uh you know science in terms of developing the humanities the arts and all that\nI mean it's remarkable what's happened because of curiosity let's talk about some of the technology today do you think in the end that the Facebook Google's artificial intelligence or going to benefit curiosity hinder\nOr is it a mixed bag\n[noise] well I think it'd be somewhat mixed bag but they think that overall it's a good thing and I tell you why one type of curiosity which is called specific curiosity which is you know when you need to know a very particular thing like what was the name of the actor in that movie or something like that\nThat actually you know I'm the availability of information to our fingertips literally you know can satisfy that very quickly I mean you know once you may be it struggled for hours to try to remember that name now you can go to college right away and find it\nThat type of curiosity indeed is kind of hinder they will be in some sense by by the availability of these stores\nBut at the ... on the other hand the important things really are headed to buy all the availability of these uh you know did you do to us because remember you know for example of questions that science us new questions that you want to research\nI mean those are questions to which you don't know the answers so you are not going to find the answers on the Internet\nSo all the all you're gonna find on the Internet is to find the information that may be able to help you to investigate the further so in that respect I find for example that the Internet really enhances my curiosity because I can satisfy the simple things right up the really fast\nBut then you know that allows me to find more information to dig deeper\nIt also allows people on platforms to connect and question each other and talk to each other in ways never before imagined professor\n... you're exactly right I mean you know I mean at the time of Leonardo and so on I mean everything you know as communicators by ... by writing letters and even those letters\nA you know where it where it down on paper which was not cheap ah and so on and you took forever you know to get to where you needed to be so you're right I mean the communication is so much faster so the passage of information is so much faster\nOr the storage information is of course completely different than all that so that that ... at the end those are the types of things that had a ...\nHow do we cultivate for the folks listening we're ever over a million people listening to our show now ah and I'm sure they're they're wondering I have kids even for myself how do I cultivate this thing called curiosity cannot go to the\n... yes it can be cultivated and you know I I Would not claim to be an expert on this but let me suggest a few things\nUh one thing is of course to ask him any questions and of course the other thing is that they are so many questions kids tend to ask many questions try not to answer the questions immediately but try to answer them in the following way you know they ask you why that didn't that and that so you try to answer when why do you think it's that\nAnd then the kids would say something and then he would say\nSo let's say that if that is the correct answer then it also means that that and that and so on and that's how you you know Dr Stanley curiosity another thing that is very very important in my opinion\nIs that you should always start with something that China is already curious about for for example you know most young children are interested in dinosaurs\nSo start science lessons with dinosaurs because they're already curious about those and from that you can then leads to other things you know you think they should know you you know for example you want to teach them about freefall acceleration on earth okay they may be bored by that\nBut they talk to them about dinosaurs and then you say when dinosaurs actually became extinct and you know why because an asteroid heat to earth and you know killed older dinosaurs\nOr you know why the asteroid either because they accelerate towards the earth because of the earth's gravity so you start with something they were curious about and you let them do something that you wanted them to know\nYou know and it's interesting because you're digging into something I think about a lot and that is where the science the science isn't story combining converge is in large measure what you're doing is telling the kittens scientific story and it's through questions and answers and this process\nThat you're driving their curiosity but my goodness looking out the story plays a part in the ideas story plays a part what how important is story the curiosity\nStories extremely important I mean you you ... you know people like stories people love story telling a I actually START I started the book with a very short story by by the American author Kate Chopin which is called the story of an hour and and the reason I started it with that\nIs because I was so impressed with her ability to create curiosity with almost every sentence you know almost every sentence heads and ends with some sort of any electoral cliffhanger and you want to read the next sentence\nAnd that's a powerful thing and we should keep that all in mind one thing that surprised you as we leave this interview what's the one thing that surprised you and your research for\nThe or a number of things that surprises me I mean for example that the difference between perceptual and if ... give us do we feel when we're surprised and curiosity we feel when you know we really love to learn uh I didn't realize that does\nYou know actually activated different parts of our brain and were associated in one case with an unpleasant state and the other with a pleasant state that surprised me another thing that it's amazing the ... was that you know I thought that curiosity is such an important topic that\nYou know lots of nor a scientist and psychologists would be working on that\nAnd I was surprised to actually see how you know a relatively small number of people are working on that\nOf course you know consciousness he's such a big thing and curiosity is just a part of eat them so north scientists start working on many other things but they were still surprised that relativity not more people are are working on curiosity specifically\nWell we're happy you did the book is why what makes us curious the author professor Mario Livio and he's a professor of astrophysics and adjunct at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and he also worked with Hubble Telescope ... twenty four years thanks so much for joining us professor ... thank you for having me\n[noise] our American story brought to you by NPR [noise]\nLos Angeles orange Mueller station\nABC News is live and local at nine o'clock I'm Jeff with all of a man was shot during the confrontation with four or five young men in Culver City around for this afternoon\nPolice say one man was shot in a parking lot of Jefferson Boulevard and Machado road and was taken to a local hospital with non life threatening injuries one suspect only described as a male juvenile was taken into custody at the scene and the rest of the suspects who are all believed to be between the Eighteen and twenty five years old are still at large\nAnd it was a media do when when the when the\nWhen the Democratic Martin not um up to ... people when it's a Republican group of politically concern people not even doing anything remotely violent than it is I'm up here is ... doing his damned is to ensure that people don't hear the truth about what Democrats are doing in the public square\n... as a mob of white supremacists who killed a woman in Charlottesville\nOlder killed ...\nPeople who are voicing their opinion about something that they don't believe in or that they think is bad for them is how the government how the country works that's not a mob\nWell I Love that the only standard for mob is they killed someone now\nThere's never been amount of outside of ... that killed somebody and by the way it's important to note that in Charlottesville the person who killed somebody\nDid so when he got in his car and drove away from his own mom and then rammed into somebody's always my mom went crazy ran over a bunch of gates and then started destroying people they did that but that didn't result in the death so even by his own macho scanner doesn't make sense Charlottesville was a mob that's the point is that the only mob\nAnd yet folks on CNN are very very strong in their belief that the only sort of mob that's real\nIs right when my Maxine Waters also trotting out the talking points Maxine Waters the same woman who said in front of a crowd that people should confront and get in the face of people at gas stations and restaurants and they should harassed folks in public places now she says well the only real type of mom is not that has to do with President Trump that's the only real kind of out\nThere trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well this president is the poster boy of for what a mob a protester looks like\nOkay so from is the definition of a poster boy for a mob you're changing the definition of a mob\nOrder to actual label actually liberal mobs not make perfect sense to me Senator Mike Lee He's a friend of mine and also I think a very solid citizen and he came out and he said listen we got he got docked last week there meaning that there was a staffer for a Democrat who revealed his personal information he says that sort of unsafe that seem sort of like a mob tactic Matty\nIt's there it's a huge there's feely I'm very I said to my mind that this\nHas to be followed you for that age if he's a lot of ... the\n... the the fact that the Democrats are now suggesting they are not involved in these sorts of non tactics is really kind of astonishing especially because there's a long history of Democrats using the mob just political tool the there there is the strategy it it's called the Fred Segal who's a an author of a a great book called the future was once here\nAbout major American cities destroyed by democratic liberalism\nHe calls it riot ideology right ideology according Fred Segal is this belief that riots are reflection of deep underlying social ills that can only be cured by more government and what you would see from the Democrat is an attempt to actually forward my politics or forward them off to feed the brain mob and make them out of a larger to encourage riots and then turn around and look at this\nThis ride is happening because the people are angry the only way to cure this is to give the people what they want a more government or dollars or something else this is a tactic of the Democrats it has been an actual tactical Democrats for generations Marion Barry who ended up being mayor of Washington DC\nWho said regarding the black Panthers were violent actual terrorists groups just I Know for a fact that white people get scared of the Panthers and they might look at somebody a little bit more moderate and say well let's give them money\nIt's a very is supporting my New York Mayor John Lindsay who is a very very liberal Republican he said the mass unrest could be dispersed more leftist policies he said quote our experiences that some good can come of confrontation politics\nRemember when the left fully embrace the Occupy Wall Street movement despite their crime and violence despite the fact that they were occupying public places and turning them into ... Jay Carney the White House press secretary under Obama said of Occupy Wall street called one man's mob is another man's democracy\nYou remember when rock Obama expressed sympathy for rioters in cities ranging from Baltimore to Ferguson he said this\nAbout the situation and burgers and he's at those who are only interested in focusing on the violence and just want the problem to go away need to recognize that we have work to do here and we shouldn't try to paper it over whatever we do that the anger may momentarily side but over time it builds up and America isn't everything that it could be\nIn other words riots are always an expression of public anger so long as the public anger moves us in the direction of more government liberalism\nIn fact rock Obama was not afraid to use them up\nAs a catalyst for his policy preferences basically throughout his entire career\nRight after the two thousand a financial crisis President Obama takes off it is a big meeting with a bunch of bank CEOs\nAnd at that meeting he turns to them and he says you basically bought you caved to my entire agenda because if you don't I Will let them I've got you this is a direct quote from Morocco bomber reported by political quote\nMy administration is the only thing between you and the pitch for that is demagoguery sure demagoguery and of course when it comes to sort of his casually by lowering would President Obama is no exception he uses language too\nIt was Jim Messina his White House deputy chief of staff who said the Democrats should punch back twice as hard it was Brock Obama who said if they bring a nice to fight we bring a gun and told people to get in their face as bronco but I'm saying that all the talk about Trump is unique in American politics because of the way he talked and that's what's causing all of us\nJust not true you have to be historically ignorance I think that\nAnd it has been a long standing part of the Democratic agenda to use mobs in order to achieve political purposes oh explain more in just a second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like use why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else while he like sleep\nWill allow you to build a personalized mattress just like everything else on the Internet you should be able to get a personalized mattress\nAnd makes the best of your sleep

you the mattresses are great we have one my sister has when we got it for her for her wedding go check them out right now he looks like dot com slash Shapiro\nSo back to the Democratic mob politics working I'm very familiar with this because they've been doing this on college campuses you basically incentivize violence on college campuses I think that if things get too violent well then we'll just ban conservative very convenient\nAnd it's ... there's violence over at Berkeley and so the administration will say well we've got a band conservative speakers until we can get a hold of the situation which is basically the rioters veto\nWe experienced this is the whole university last year when students suggested that they might get riots and violence over me visiting campus and so the poll simply bands me and then they threatened to arrest me if I showed up\nThere's tape of me standing in front of a security guard their head of security there who's telling me that if I take one step forward you will arrest me\nAnd it's truly amazing stuff Democrats engaged in this sort of stuff for very long time and it's always rich to hear what they're willing to label him up folks on the left were perfectly willing to label not only Trump supporters amount of go back a few years before that I'm old enough to remember the Tea Party\nWhich was in large part a bunch of people standing around carrying don't tread on me flags and reading the declaration of independence at rallies\nI went to a bunch of Tea Party events I spoke at a bunch of the party that I was a charter member of the Tea Party\nThe left called them mobs lifted that the tea partiers were ... they said occupy which was involved in actual criminal activity many many many literally dozens and dozens maybe hundreds of arrests across the country of occupy protestors that was not a mob but the Tea Party was mob\nFor Democrats any form of Republican speech is demagoguery and being a mob anytime you get more than two Republicans in an area together it's mob but Democrats who are actually charging the steps of the Supreme Court\nBashing on the thirteenth on doors and chanting stop Brett Kavanaugh those people are not people who are running for the Senate Hart building trying to button the whole senators in elevators without security protocols those people are not um up it's not a mob when folks go to\nWashington DC find conservatives and then written up their son that's not a mob it's not a mob when you have Occupy Wall street occupy large swaths of land in ...\nYesterday's arrest of a

sensitive about things he says that NPR's Dominic ... a month to narrow pointed out in August that since Trump announced he's running for president he has used the word is unfair sixty nine times in sweet and since becoming president\nForty times and then he says Trump sense of fairness or unfairness really has driven him his rise in politics and his priorities for the country has capitalized on grievance especially that a white Americans chafing at the culture they demographically changing country and have expressed as you know what is on there everything from trade and immigration to the court system now\nOn the show I have said that I don't like victimization culture I don't like it from white folks and like from lack of like the idea that you believe that you are a victim in a free society\nWould that set the left has been saying for years on end the day of the white man is over the day of whites in this country is over demographic shifts are going to completely changed the way the culture is done and white men it's time for you to sit down and shut up\nThat is a form of discrimination\nIf you actually want to make an argument in favor of a cultural shift in America make the argument in favor of the cultural shift but don't do it predicated on the color of the people that you're talking about that is what the left has done and it's driving an awful lot of backlash and I think to a certain extent appropriate backlash\nIf you say to a group of people you know longer matter in American Life what do you think they're going to do what do you think they're going to do\nSo Charles Blow concludes through it all Trump's monitoring mission remain clear to bind together toxic masculinity and racial performance anxiety into a weapon that can repel change any perceived diminution of white male pregnancy hump is on a campaign to make America as white men feel great again\nWell maybe President Trump is on emissions you point out that discriminatory politics in any form is bad or if he's not he should be\nAnd he's not he certainly should be and that that is a really biased take on what's going on in American politics that Trump wants to bind together toxic masculinity and racial performance anxiety is suggesting being the only people who are angry right now the only people who are upset with the west are toxic males want to write people and whites were underperforming\nNonsense nonsense I Am angry at lack of due process and I am Baptist feminist as as it is possible to be with regard to what women should be allowed to do in the United states they should have every right that men have and I've said that one million times on this program it'd be very difficult to label me toxic we masculine\nAnd ask for racial performance anxiety is idea that when I'm really upset about\nThe white people are under performing I don't really have that that's not a thing and I'm I'm not concerned about the color of people were underperforming\nAnd I certainly am not want to be the these folks who is supposedly underperforming generally it'd be hard to make that case as well I Am angry however an angry at a left which seeks to divide us based on color and then the minute you say listen sat dividing us based on color left as on us because you're a patriarchal discriminatory white man\nThat's the logic being used right now now this will backlash this will backlash in the back Russia's not just going to come from white folks the great lie of left is it political correctness has been embraced by all parties and political correctness is only opposed by the white majority\nThat's alive less well there is a new study out from Josh among he's a lecture on government at Harvard University and here's what he signs he says that Americans across cultural and ethnic lines don't like PC culture in Illinois them they are sick of left trying to shut down debate I simply shouting that you are of a particular color\nHere's what he writes at the
