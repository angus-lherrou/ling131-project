switch from an acoustic guitar\n\n\nVarious places in New Orleans has been proposed as the inspiration for the song with varying plausibility\nThe phrase house with the rising sun is often understood as a euphemism for Brussels is not known whether or not the house describing the lyrics was an actual or a fictitious place one theory is if a song is about a woman who killed her father an alcoholic gambling who would beat in his wife\nTherefore the house or the rising sun might be a jailhouse from which one would be the first to see the sunrise an idea supported by the lyric mentioning a ball and chain but that phrase has been slang for marital relationships for at least as long as the song has been in print\nBecause women often sing the song another series at the house of a rising sun was

McKinley avenue here's Josh ... of the national Transportation Safety\nBut flake just collapsed and he said All right well you know that the Democrats have been trying to do everything they can to delay the vote just because they want to get to the midterms they hope they can take back the Senate they hope they can keep Trump from having any more\nSupreme Court picks or anything if they get the Senate they'll stop doing anything [noise]\nSo he keeps him he says All right we've got to have an FBI investing\nNow the FBI investigations nonsense that doesn't mean anything\nThe most telling clue that the FBI investigation doesn't mean anything was an article in the op ed written by your old friends James call me in the New York times former newspaper former head of the FBI and a former newspaper writing\nA an op ed that says the FBI can do this and he starts out with this long self serving power grab about how impartial he is\nPeople kept calling impartial people kept saying that he was for the Democrats and not for the Republicans the rest of the op ed is an attack on the Republicans he says we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears it's work\nHe calls for his enemies to be prosecuted and his friends free meal in a world where the president is accused serial abusers women who was caught on tape bragging about his ability to assault women\nThat by the way is not true he was caught on tape saying that women would allow you to do things if you were a celebrity that as an assault that as women allow that's why I I think that's why when it gets rid of\nMost disturbingly we live in a world where millions of Republicans in their representatives think everything I just said is okay so we age the Republicans he says the FBI's up for this it's not as hard as Republicans hope it will be Republicans hope they can't find the truth we already telling you what he thinks he's already telling you what he thinks the FBI is going to find\nThis is a shameful disgraceful thing for a former accomplished show right the fire this guy he should have fired him and then kick them you know I was like don't let the door hit you on the way out to kick them in the back side as he was leaving\nHe says listen to this this is James Comey has got to lead the FBI\nFBI agents no time has very little to do with memory\nThey they know every married person remembers the weather on their wedding day no matter how long ago significance drives memory they also know that little wise point to bigger was all of that is on for all of that as an for people you know they do this guy's in court all the time says I guy says I saw a murder\nAnd I saw this I saw Mr ... murder mystery why and they said did you rely on your resume in Nineteen eighty two guesses yeah obviously didn't need a job see well if you live then you would line up with everything he says is wrong it is not true it is not true that ... the time doesn't affect memory time does all kinds of crazy things with memory\nTen minutes can affect your memory and make you think you saw something that you didn't see any really turned out to be an intellectual but this guy the guy who just uses his pretense of honor and dignity to uh to bully other people meanwhile Rachel Mitchell\nThe prosecutor that the Republicans brought into question a Christine Blasey Ford sheen gave a report to the Republicans they brought her in to get the truth they didn't bring her and she didn't say this in public they brought her into get us the truth\nAnd she said of of Christine Blasey Ford she said she said remember this was a woman train in prosecuting the sexual cases\nHe said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove that this case\nIs even even weaker than that Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted around with Haitians will fail to corroborate them for the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case\nBased on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard which means you don't even have to prove beyond a shadow of the doubt and you just have to bring a lot of evidence\nDoesn't matter Jeff Flake caves lesson to Jeff Flake listen to what the women say definitely gets into the elevator and these women across to listen to what they say\n\nYou're not [laughter] [laughter]\nSo what is what is just Brett Kavanaugh will have to do with this woman why is Jeff Flake telling this woman anything about herself\nShe's saying I was assaulted and therefore if you let somebody else who's been accused of assault and parents according to the prosecutor number incredibly\nWho's been accused of ... you were saying something about me and this is the left wing why not just you know that was Anna Maria ... and Maggie Gallagher are the two women and according to John ... who is an excellent reporter ... or ... is an executive director of the center for popular democracy she spent the previous week in Washington engaged in protest against Kavanaugh\nShe's a Gallagher is uh twenty three year old activist with the group the center is a left wing group that is heavily funded by yes who George Soros and these are short roast operatives doing what Soros wants them to do and I mean I think that that's important to know as an actor and what's the tactic\nThat tactic is to make Brett Kavanaugh the symbol of oil rape is not an individual accused of a certain crime more buttoned just a second but first you know this radio show is just one small planet and the ... bureau universe\nIf you want to hear more you should head over to daily wire dot com where you can catch

Maria or who confront them she went on TV unreal Keeler she went on TV and this is what you said\nWe have a culture that fundamentally doubt women and respect\nOur ability to lead a ability to a ... to exercise power our ability to control our bodies and Brett Kavanaugh represents that he represents a culture that's fundamentally that's not believe that women are equal and then that's why he's so dangerous\nAnd she has expressed that his actions as a young boy actions that he's willing to take responsibility for\n... and he has spent that in his politics I think he's a dangerous to their country and not just because he's accused\nOf very credible allegations of having violated several women but he is also the dangers because there were some chest as about recognizing when harm happened\nTaking respond civility for that harm and beginning to repair it she's not able to do that in his own life he should not be sitting in the highest part of the Latin\nSo now Kevin represents the entire culture not compare that to what Kellyanne Conway said the Jake Tapper as they've covering this because she said she was a victim of sexual assault but listen to her conclusion\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment\nAnd rate that\nActual thought I don't expect and charged Kavanaugh Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake\nOr or anybody can he how responsible for that responsible ... own conduct\nI cannot tell ... those those ... network or a disgrace and the ... call them out this is not even thinking you've had Senate candidate number is ... and Bill Clinton from office at the oral sex in the oval office and lie about it to a grand jury as part of the United states\nThat have ...\nIs ridiculous and if not one tenant Judiciary Committee member changes his or her vote\nBecause of what they learned from the ... that tells you all you need to know about what the president and judge Kavanaugh has had an issue and let's just be honest and

heading towards Burbank that suspect reportedly wanted ... D you I\nKnow a woman is seeking millions of dollars in damages after she says she was wrongfully accused of murder\nSherry ... was arrested for the main killing of a sixty six year old woman outside of rolling hills sustain small however she was later released and never charged\nDamaging to me family for is I'm not sure that life will ever be the same for a\nTown center says this false accusation has the same her name and destroyed her life the sheriff's department did not say if she is still a suspect but says the case has proven to be very complex James Rojas KABC news\nA south LA attorney who once represented former rap mogul Marion shook night was arrested today on a federal bank fraud charge you allegedly deposited a stolen U.S Treasury check worth over a million dollars into a Pasadena bank last year\nAnd that is called pepper accused of deposited in a total of Twenty one stolen tax refund checks worth more than one point three million dollars into several attorney client trust accounts\nColpepper also charged along with another attorney with conspiring to bribe potential witnesses and obstruct justice ensure nights murder case will night ended up pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter in that case last month\nAnd a fire tore through a bacon building in the forty seven hundred black Melrose Avenue in east Hollywood around two thirty this afternoon no injuries reported the building described as a combination of one and two stories the cause is under investigation talk radio seven Ninety K.

right ... thank God that's for sure over the movie but when when the left me say smart talking tough youthful blonde and real life what do they do they run for the hills they hate or they hate or so she wrote a piece called no more Mr White guy because this is another way this is another way which the left is trying to organize us\nInto gangs they start attacking white people she the games I played this on the air last week she begins\nLike just reciting all the things that people have said uh they know the optics of Lebanon white men questioning Dr Ford will be so harmful says uh CNN legal analysts are they understand they have all these were white men would be questioning his words as Gloria borders another seeing an analyst\nOr a ... a congressman says women across this nation should be outrage at what these white men are doing and she goes on and on and she says you know\nAnd then and says is the Supreme\nCourt confirmation hearing resumes as we protect Brett Kavanaugh it's clear that the Republicans are simply too white\nTo get the job done I suggest the Republican sign up some outside help the way baseball teams make late season acquisitions of pitchers in designated interest for the playoffs they can get some black men and then she starts listing all the black men who've been accused and convicted of\nOf hurting women the Reverend Al Sharpton Bill Cosby Keith Ellison story about the ways either the beating\nHis wife and his girlfriend and they're just like completely bearing that story\nShe says what is the thinking behind snickering white men judging an accusation sexual assault\nThat Chuck Grassley is rape is you can be for rape or against it she says I happened to be against it but the idea that alleged sexual assault survivors need the

Pacific less raping creature than the white male of Western European descent\nSo really comes out but the thing is they set the rules if the less set the rules that they can be racist they can attack white people\nAnd his Wright's chicken respond in kind and they're certainly setting rules\nVikings that's certainly male and female with us talk about that with one of our nominal males I think he's a male is Michael Michael you you you identify as male looking\nI identify as it depends when I'm On my MSNBC show I identify as a moment but now identify as a male you were a citizen of the sexual universe I [laughter]\nAnd also the host of the Michael Moore show which do you know it is for men and women both I think\n[laughter] it depends on the day when I have I so\nI mean one of the reasons I have a ... a video out today called who needs feminism and its attack on feminism I'm an anti feminist and one of the reasons I hate feminism is because it blames men for things that are just part of nature and it blames men for the\nJourney of women to the place that they are now only happened because of men because men invented things because men had ideas that basically liberated women when the technology was available and yet they hate us as as it is it fair to say feminism is selling an anti male\nStory how dare you up and I just like young men [laughter] because I met him or got that you identify as something you didn't know what I Know [laughter] it's a\nIt is now truth just say feminism is anti male not just the anti this guy or not just anti that guy anti male\nAnd this was always the case we would always say oh feminism they seem to be so angry and against men and whatever [noise] um and they would say well that's not true feminism is this evidence was that they now it
