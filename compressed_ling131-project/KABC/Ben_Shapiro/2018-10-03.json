occurred in September Nineteen eighty five during Mr Kavanaugh's junior year resulted Mr capital and four other men being questioned by the New Haven police department by the way\nI my son went to Yale I'm sure these kind of push the law essentially what they're saying is they're accusing\nThat Kavanaugh drinking in college which is like accusing him of having temper tantrums when he was two years old and really as if the New York times ran a front page story a least reports show that Brett Kavanaugh's a two year old\nWas throwing blocks and crying loudly and ... mothers rushed to the scene of his angry ranch right is this something that is kind of temperament you want and it's like he was never supposed to be young he was never supposed to do things in India we shouldn't do\nWhen you want to stand before that judge I mean it's that amazing would you want to stand before a judge would never done anything wrong couldn't understand what people were and what you know how they act in when they were young and had no compassion\nUnbelievable unbelievable story it is just the modest just about the fact that the real charges the chargers that matter\nAre falling apart MSNBC this isn't just an amazing piece of video I got to play for you\nThey had Julie sweating it on like she's the woman who said that there were these gang rape parties like ten of them and I went to ten of them [laughter] you know it's just you know it's like Julie stopped going to the gang rape parties you know when you get the invitation that says please come to my gang rape already\nKnow don't don't totally gang rape party stay home watch TV you know Netflix and she'll you know like do not go to the but Kate Snow within an NBC reporter and I I really feel for her because as a journalist she's interview enjoyment and she can tell this woman\nStory is unraveling so she starts to ask her about discrepancies\n... did she really mean inner statement that you made to the committee\nDid she mean these things so she starts off by asking her a sweating it said that she saw Kavanaugh's bike the punch so he could get women drunk to prepare them for the satanic a date rape I think it was written in humans sacrifices that what do ... you know the usual thing that happens at least ... I mean are we going to hold him accountable for\nListening to even watch on screen as her story falls apart\nAgency Brett Kavanaugh you know fighting a pint should I saw I saw him getting red solo cups girls during that time frame and their ... parties and I would not take one of those classes found bark Adam ... catalogs and\nI saw him around the punch I won't say malls or the punch containers\nI don't know why he did that I saw him by them yes\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause and girls to become an ... an disoriented so they could then be gang raped inside rumor bedroom by train as numerous boys\nI have a ... recollection is seen boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room\nThese boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat did you have to say well and so what happened and he happened to me I didn't put to ensure together but I Would say boy standing outside and rooms congregated together sort of like an outlet and I didn't know what was occurring I thought I Would see them laughing a lot of laughing\nSo they were drinking punch and laughing [laughter] you know it's like so it's sort of like gang rape it's sort of a ... you know gang rape\nOr drinking ... there's a really you know those two things once you've seen one you can just to do\nThe other I mean it was it was ... it was a barrister and and you know Kate Snow started off the report by saying she contradicted herself she has no ... we call she says cakes and said we called all these people nobody will corroborate her story like ever on\nWhy why in the news I mean anybody can say anything about anyone and now there was a report or I think in the a P\nThat's that said uh they start to talk about the fact that she's been involved in at least six legal cases over the past twenty five years some of which involved\nA what evidence strongly suggests or multiple false claims okay\nShe had a legal dispute highlighted by the a P and then in Nineteen Ninety four a personal injury lawsuit sweating filed against the Washington metropolitan area transit authority which contains strong evidence and she attempted to swindle the department AP reports it's right next to the transit authority for four hundred and twenty thousand dollars in earnings\nShe says she allegedly lost after hurting her nose in the fall I mean\nYou know her boyfriend who says she's kind of a coup\nDavid French over in our road a lawyer or he says all of these\nCharges are falling apart that is why we're hearing about temperament that is why we're hearing about drinking which by the way is not against the law that is why we're hearing all this stuff it's meant to scare women is this actually meant to scare women there was a big it's a gender gap in the voting right now\nRight now the polls are kind of shifting around very hard to read and so this is having an effect on the mid term but we don't know what it is yet so it's a David French and in a row starts to debunk\nLot of the other charges he says Deborah Ramirez is allegation she's the one who said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party at Yale that's where it was it's uncorroborated difficult to believe she was drinking heavily at the time she confesses that are memory contains gaps\nEven told other classmates but she wasn't service certain it was Kavanaugh no one else could even confirm she was at the party where the incidents allegedly occurred let me pause right there for

always criticized him when I thought he deserve criticism and I've always praise the one I thought he deserved praise but the one thing that I have noticed how incredibly cool he's being\nIn this Kavanaugh fight I mean she is ... ... ... he's ... and and look let's let's face it\nCool is not the word I wouldn't usually use to describe Donald Trump right cool is usually very hot tempered he usually is like flying off the the handle these got tweets going that maybe shouldn't be doing\nShe is playing this Kavanaugh saying like she has got it showed up and the reason that's important is you cannot deny you cannot deny whatever you think of Donald Trump you cannot than I spent ... political instincts scheme knows what is going on with his base he knows what's going on with the country and he's got the press\nIn his pocket he is complicated bouncing them down the street like a basketball no matter every time they come at him it's like you think it's got all this time they've got
