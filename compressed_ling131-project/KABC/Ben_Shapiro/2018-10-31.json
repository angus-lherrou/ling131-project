gas I thought you were rather an honest straightforward person\nI thought it was your secret primed I'm thirty I said I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it on her she didn't answer angry

think if you you're crazy neck he said quickly crazy as hell I don't know what's the matter with you Tom I inquired\nWhat did you say the Wilson that afternoon\nHe stared at me without a word and I knew I had guest writes about those missing hours I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm I told him the truth he said\nIt came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down were that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs he was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told them along the car his hand was on a revolver in his pocket every
