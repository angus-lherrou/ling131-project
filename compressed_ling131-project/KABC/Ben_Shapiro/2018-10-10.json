{"content": "Dealing with her emotions that way being able to control the mantle to target them toward objective and I think\nUh it gives everyone a better understanding of of how to operate a team environment and what courage really is\nA song about Tom Brady at the University of Michigan where he plays as a college and no one could imagine what would have been in store for him as an NFL player he was a sixth round draft pick and the trouble keeping you starting job in college\nThough he lost it I mean that\nDoes your hands and it was you know are supposed to be the next great quarterback the second coming up you know Joe Montana yeah I Know he went through a lot and you know I'm ... the fact that he even got on the field with the flu because he only got to play because of serious injury to drew Bledsoe\nAnd it really shows you you know that that it's very easy sometimes to not look inside some I mean I think he had great talent and physical talent and you know we'd seen many flashes of that Michigan but what was really working side him was incredible elite leadership ability and\nYou know also great tactical mind and all those things that you know I think scouts too often dismissed brain was tough because you know braid is a complex fence\nI Know everyone loves to talk about Brady and a great for the patriots but you know until I Believe the season when they made another Super Bowl and and won eight eight straight AFC Championship games you know their record was very similar to the forty niners in that long stretch or they were very dominant so\nSame number of Super Bowls roughly the same winning percentage so I had a very hard time saying that either one of those teams was unique so initially\nFor the hardcover I didn't put the patriots and but later on I after they made that Super Bowl I decided to put them in because I thought they were clearly ... paste the forty niners but the thing about Brady that stands out to me the most\nBeyond his leadership qualities is his relationship with his coach and that is something that is fascinating to me and I said the coaches weren't the important factor the crucial factor and I don't think they are but what's really important in these great teams with coaches is that they have a partnership with their captain\nAnd I saw this over and over again it wasn't a boss employee kind of relationship bill\nCheck and Tom Brady had this relationship that was unusual it was like the relationship Tim Duncan hadn't read opposition to\nIt was very affectionate and there's a lot of of love between them but they knew how to fight and they would fight all the time they would come into conflict about tactics never personally it was always about how he was planning\nTo do a check would would go to the meetings and rip Brady in front of everyone from mistakes that he ... and ... he would take it and it would tell everyone that no one's above the team but you know Tom ready to like the super bowl playbook that he was given he would tell them to rip it up and start over so\nThat partnership I think was really under rated if you remember\nThat first season Tom Brady came he was six round draft pick no one thought was or anything and Bill Belichick was a guy who got fired at Cleveland and no one thought had the chops the head coach and together they became two of the legends of football but I don't think you could separate um I don't think it was something that could have achieved\nIndividually I think that partnership and their ability to work together was so important and\nI think the message for coaches and people managers and people who are trying to assemble\nIt was with this kind of leadership model is that you got to pick someone to leave that team that you can really Parker with and that you respect and that you can uh really treated appear\nI think that's true and there was a balance of power you wrote about in a mutual respect and the fighting wasn't a bad thing and you were quite the Greek captains and coaches to married couples I was lucky to see a great marriage my mom and dad would fight like cats and dogs and it was over right after the fight and then I'd see I'm loving each other and then when they disagree they go at it\nAnd it was respect for each other and they taught me how to fight\nWhich is a wonderful thing people who can disagree and then carry on you're giving the greatest gift in the world\nIt's true it's so under rated and\nIt's funny because especially in sports there's this weird sense that conflict is bad you know there there's there are certain players and the and the thing about these cats as was they were not edge\nI mean they would push back on anything they didn't think was the best interest of the team or there was something big or small they would push back against the coaches they were pushed back against your team that says well they were willing to stand apart\nAnd you talked about courage and you know that's an underrated form of courage and the ability to just dissent from the group and scientists who actually shown that that there is a an element of physical discomfort that comes with banning apart\nSo it's something that's not easy to do and yet it's so crucial you know all the studies that have been done a team performance show\nTeams that really work together and and coasts wave as they do in sports\nA certain level of conflict in the central but there's a different kind of conflict there's two cuts really there's a kind of conflict they called Taft conflict which is really about an argument about process about how the team is doing something or how they should do something\nAnd there's another form of conflict which is personal conflict this is one the source of the copy is really just I don't like and there's a real difference at all these cabins whenever they introduced conflict in their teams they made a huge point to make clear that it wasn't\nPersonally never singled out individual and never played any one person he was always about the collect and it was always about the task in the process\nAnd it's a huge difference it's so easy to mistake goes to look at someone who is creating conflicts or as a bad thing when you're not really necessary looking at why they're doing it or how they're doing it and\nThat was one of the real secrets I feel like I'm covered for me I had no idea about so I really took a look at it\nSam you wrote something fascinating about all these captains that they were more like jazz musicians than conductors and that they freely improvised on and off the court to get the job done\nThere was one of the things that I never considered when I think about teams but there was a famous researcher named Richard ... there was a Harvard psychologist she passed away a few years ago\nHe spent all of his career embedded with performance teams that do things in real time whether airplane cockpit cruise or\nEmergency room units or even symphony orchestras and he would watch the way leadership work and when he discovered was so exact parallels to what I found in these teams which is that\nThe leaders charisma talented not\nIt just wasn't a factor that could have it they could not have to really make a difference\nAll that mattered in fact in terms of leadership inside of group is that every single important function of leadership get stuck that said you know anything that needs to be done in order to help the team from ... perspective as long as someone does it have to be the leader it could be somebody else and all these great teams what you saw\nWas that these captains had established themselves as the person who would do anything it says a burning building that no one else wants to go to they're going to go into it\nAnd once that this tablets and basically everyone on the team with her a superstar or a bench player understands that they're free to do their jobs and focus on what they need to do and if they want to contribute to leadership they can they can do it the way they want to do the things that they're good outlets mentorship\nYou know being the spark plug for being share for doing something else to help the teams that group and you start to see this happening this beautiful symphony that starts where everyone does what they're good at and everyone pitches in every single auction of leadership is taking care of and\nA great leader will never feel territorial never feel unhappy that someone is doing a leadership function because frankly it's a hard job being a great leader you know and sustain a excellence is incredibly taxing and difficult and\nAnyone who is doing it the right way will be so happy to have help and assistance from others\nOn this book will help others in

disruptions\nCouncil members unanimously approved changes to the council meetings and committees rules allowing audience members to be banned for several days for unruly behavior in a show of defiance protesters disrupted the meeting before the boat\nIn ... across the ... that was the average climate change\nAnd then it turns out that this new report basically says that\nWe are warming less bashed than the than the UN thought we were so the young keeps giving these ten year window stand in ten years we're really going to blow it in five years we're going to blow it in three years we're going to blow it well now the new report they should be the headline today it's not that line the new report basically suggest sort of the opposite that\nIt does in chapter two of of this\nYou report and the key quote says well there is high agreements across various lines of evidence assessed in the report that the remaining carbon budget from one point five degrees Celsius or two degrees Celsius would be larger than the estimate the time of the ... the air five is lasting study they did that was back in I Believe twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen\nWhat that means you know in in non science be is that\nIt turns out that our carbon emissions have been lower than they thought they were when they first made their estimate which means that the climate is warming it slightly lower rate than they thought it would be at this point so the estimated date for hitting one point five degrees Celsius some of global warming\nIs actually it's been pushed out further now they were saying that we're going to hit that in three four years now they're saying we're going to hit that in ten years they keep pushing that down the line\nThe reason that this creates some skepticism among folks is not because people don't necessarily believe in climate change at all is that the climate is changing\nIt does raise questions as to the sensitivity of the climate to human produced\nCarbon emissions Cuban produce greenhouse gases\nSkepticism I think is warranted with regard to some of the more outrageous claims that are being made by un members and radical leftists who do indeed many of them have an alternative agenda and not just saying they have an alternative gender they're basically saying that there's going to be recalled house who is a meteorologist and a visiting scholar\nAt um at us and Ireland I'm not sure what the University of Minnesota I suppose\nI and he he actually calls for an end to capitalism in order to fight climate change now there are a lot of folks on the right who have been suggesting for a long time that was actually the agenda here that all of the worry the extreme worry about climate change was really designed to hamper America's economy in the world and the evidence for this\nWas actually presence right there was evidence that for example the Paris accords which were demands on the United states that we were supposed to radically shift how we did business while other countries made empty promises about how they did business by China's suggested for example that they were committed to reducing greenhouse gases after peaking in twenty thirty\nWell American studies already showed that China was planning on peeking it's greenhouse gases in twenty thirty they promise to do something are already gonna do\nIndia promised that they were going to gradually lower greenhouse gas emissions at some point in the future that promise didn't mean anything there's a lot of folks in the United states were saying well why are we committing ourselves do attempts and targets when the world's greatest emitters and polluters are not actually time themselves to anything\nOf substance here no Eric Auld house he says that if you're wondering what you can do about climate change the world's top scientists just gave rigorous backing to systemically dismantled capitalism as a key requirements maintaining civilization and a habitable planet I mean if you're looking for something to do\nSo the idea is that we have to get rid of capitalism completely where is he getting this from in the report well there's a section in chapter four of the un report that says increasing evidence suggests that climate sensitive realignment of savings in expenditure toward low emission climate resilience infrastructure and services requires an evolution of global international financial system\nEstimate suggests that in addition to climate friendly allocation of public investments that'd be like building levees and ensuring that there's infrastructure a potential re direction of five to ten percent of the annual capital revenues is necessary so basically the entire profit margin should be redirected as the un suggest that it should be read directed\nNow there are several problems with this report the first problem is the way that it's actually reported by mainstream media so the way the New York times reports this than the landmark report from the un scientific panel on climate change painting a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought\nExcept that's not really not much change between the twenty Thirteen report and this particular part they are five and this report not much changed at all\nIn fact the only thing it really changes that they said that they are forecast for doom has actually been pushed out a few more years but the way the New York times covered this that everyone is going to die at one point five degrees Celsius changed by twenty forty as opposed to two degrees Celsius\nChanged by twenty forty the report issued on Monday by the inter governmental panel on climate change\nSays that a world where it describes the world the worsening food shortages and wildfires amassed die off of coral reefs as soon as twenty forty a period well within the lifetime of much of a global population when\nThe New York times says that what they want you to picture is the day after tomorrow that movie with Dennis Quaid where suddenly giants nominee just washers through New York city and ... the whole place under ice for a thousand years\nAnd global warming is responsible for the rising sea levels and everyone dies and catastrophic it's deep impact except with climate\nThe problem is that that's not really true all of this climate change is going to happen over the course of the next century human beings are pretty good and adaptable when it comes to adapting overtime to threats to present themselves overtime climate has been changing across the world for the last century and a half to listen to Eighteen eighty Seventy\nAnd human beings have been migrating and moving and developing new technologies to deal with all of that and the same will hold true in the future as well\nAnd I talk a little bit more about the un report in just a second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like usa why would you buy a

there's just a climate analytics a nonprofit organization they're a left leaning one we're not aware of this just a few years ago it's quite a shock and quite concerning that this is the first report commissioned by world leaders under the Paris Agreement\nAgain is that two thousand Fifteen pack that people supposedly signed but really made no real commitment to keep and Trump said this is a waste of time and pulled us\nOut of it so the authors filed found that of greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate the atmosphere will warm up as much as you point seven degrees Fahrenheit one point five degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels by twenty forty inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty there are\nSignificant problems I should mention in climate change modeling none of the models have been put forth so far actually\nReflect the level of climate change that's been occurring virtually all of them over shoot the mark\nAnd that's because climate is actually very difficult to predict that a lot of factors that are involved in climate now how much of climate change is caused by human activity certainly some the PC she says eighty percent folks like Roy Spencer who I'm sure you've heard on the other talk radio has Irma Rush Limbaugh Roy Spencer\nBut he says that he thinks about fifty percent but certainly our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions leads to climate change the question is really not whether that's happening as to what extent and also what the economic damage is from such climate change what the human damages from such climate change\nSo than New York times is playing this up as much as humanly possible\nAvoiding the most serious damage as requires transforming the world economy than just a few years said the authors who estimate that the damage would come at a cost you fifty four trillion dollars while they conclude that it it's technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid to point seven degrees of warming they concluded maybe politically unlikely\nFor example the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions perhaps as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton by\nTwenty one hundred would be required that takes forty dollar per gallon tax on carbon\nHas what you're talking about every time you go to the pump and you buy ten gallons of gas you're not paying four hundred dollars in tax in order to meet that twenty seven thousand dollars per ton number\nThe Obama administration had suggested fifty dollars per ton and that was considered high at the time and all of this is to say that these estimates are are wildly overstated in terms of the amount\nOf damage that they are likely to do the reason that I say that it's because of the report itself
