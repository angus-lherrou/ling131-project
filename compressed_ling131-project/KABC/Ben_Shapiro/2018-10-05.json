and she took the test and unfortunately I came back\nThat she has an eighty percent chance risk of getting cancer by the time she's in her sixties [noise]\nWhich is obviously terrifying but there's

other side and we had no idea that actually we got some cash on her mom's side we have no idea there was this really high risk and that side of the family and so the her mom and saw her doctor\nAsk Jeff doctor what do I do know is there anything we should now is Dr said oh wow that's that's weird I've never heard of this before someone just go and take the test but it does seem like a ... we should probably take her ovaries out just in case but you know you're totally fine or healthy I wouldn't worry about it but yeah come in next month will how the procedure is a good thing to do and so she comes in the next month\nTouted procedure and they cut in and take their ovaries out\nAnd they discover like stage three ... three see cancer so it's it's not quite stage for but it's pretty late

O.\nLos Angeles orange\nCumulus station\nKABC loses live and local at nine o'clock I'm just a little and former rap mogul showed night was sentenced today that twenty eight\nYears behind bars after pleading guilty recently to voluntary manslaughter for the hit and run death the Terry Carter in Compton and twenty Fifteen before night learned is fake Carter's sister Jessica read a statement written by his mother Lillian\nWhich included says if you're in multiple committee interviews over twelve hundred questions for the record and over half a million pages of documents but the digital information the White House is fully confident that said it will vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court President Trump tweeted out this morning\nThe action unfair treatment a judge that cat now is having an impact on voters that people get it far better than that\nMost importantly this\nGreat live life cannot be a boon in Maine and just the couple Democrat and totally uncorroborated allegation\nIs a hundred percent right on the even Britain even expressing gratitude that Trump is president today which is an amazing thing right Brett evens it out as anti Trump as possible debate he is a true never Trump Republican and he came out in the New York times today and said I Am very very pleased that Donald Trump is president and standing by Brett Kavanaugh\nNow there are a lot of folks on the left who don't seem to understand why folks on the right or so passionate about this issue\nThe original passionate about this issue is because it looks like due process and presumption of innocence who've been talk completely unknown a second I'm gonna get to the counter argument being made by some folks I think in good faith folks like Ken Harris on his podcast and I'm friendly with them\nAnd we've been having a little bit about text back and forth about this and I don't I'm not really any secrets he's had all this stuff publicly on and talk about that and just a second but\nThe way that Republicans are viewing this conservatives are viewing this way independents are viewing this is a man was accused after thirty six years\nOf allegedly sexually assaulting a girl back when he was Seventeen years old there is no corroborating evidence and Democrats want to run him out of his life over it\nAnd then the media have decided to latch onto every single room or they possibly can in order to prevent cab not from joining the court\nThat is what this looks like anyone I think of objective I don't even think it's conservative and they want to justify the process sucks now there are two separate questions and this is where I think it's worthwhile discussing the most intellectually honest version of the ... case\nThere are two separate questions does the process suck and does Brett Kavanaugh deserve to be on the court now these two issues are not completely separate\nThe process and it stuck edge or one of the reasons why Brett Kavanaugh got himself into a little bit of trouble with regard to his testimony him to talk about the trouble he got himself into with regard was testimony just a second but the ... of the process is what most people are concerned with at this point because it feels like what ever\nComplaints are being made about Brett Kavanaugh sexually fruit of the boys in history when you accusing guy a gang rape and you start going through his your book and then your final case against him is he filmed about stuff in his high school yearbook and that's why he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court that feels like we're the poison history in the worst possible way\nAnd in a second I'm gonna discuss that case\nAlso it feels like the media are out to get cabinet because they are ruining Daryl has done some really good work on the beach and stuff like some some really excellent work\nThe meat you stuff and he completely has undermined his own credibility with regard to Brett Kavanaugh so you recall that a week ago the New York or in a piece by Jane Mayer who is not a good reporter and Ronan Farrow who is a good reporter\nThey put out a piece suggesting that woman in Deborah Ramirez back when she was at Yale was in a broken wrap party and Brett Kavanaugh ... pans and exposed himself to her\nAnd that was the accusation it was at a party she apparently considered it for six days 'cause she wasn't sure that you remember that correctly or that it was cabinet\nAnd then she came forward and told the story there were no corroborating witnesses well last night the New Yorker decides in order to undermine the credibility of the FBI investigation they are going to come forward with new witnesses to Deborah Ramirez statement\nWell that'd be kind of a bombshell wouldn't it except that not actually what the report said on Wednesday evening New Yorker runs his investigative piece from Iran Ronan Farrow the peace claimed that the FBI investigation into sexual assault claims against Kavanaugh was insufficient what made the investigation into fishing well here's what they said they said quote\nFrustrated potential witnesses who have been unable to speak with the FBI agents conducting the investigation into sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had been resorting to sending statements unsolicited the bureau and dissenters in hopes that there would be seen before the inquiry concluded\nThe FBI investigation is justice Feinstein said insufficient because there are a bunch of witnesses who have not been interrogated by the FBI and they've been desperately reaching out the FBI trying to tell their vital story what are their vital story well\nThe key vital story comes from a guy named Kenneth apple tennis apples according to the New Yorker was asleep me a break Kavanaugh's at the time of the alleged incidents in previously spoken to the New Yorker about ... condition of anonymity but he said that he is now willing to be identified because he believed the FBI must thoroughly investigator allegation\nApple with James tasting Nichols professor of reformation history at Princeton Theological Seminary than the first heard about the alleged incident involving cabinet and Ramirez either the night that occurred or a day or two later apple said he was one hundred percent certain that he was told that Kavanaugh was a male student who exposed himself Ramirez\nWell okay that's pretty damn and stuff I mean here's a guy who's saying that he heard about\nCabinet exposing himself at this party so why isn't yesterday talking to him clearly the FBI investigation is a ruse clearly it hasn't been done most thoroughly enough and all the rest of it well\nThere's only one problem buried a few paragraphs down there in the story is a little spoiler that completely undermines the New Yorker story I Will explain that one or two in just one second\nBut first let's talk about your comfort down below alright you close your eyes imagine yourself in the locker room back in high school were in your current underwear I Know it's just a nightmare in every respect why would you want to be back in high school why would you want to be in the locker room\nAnd why would you want to be wearing those ugly ugly underwear if the answer is you wouldn't\nWell then maybe you should try Tommy John the revolutionary clothing brand is redefining comfort for men and women Tommy John obsessing over every little detail in pitch by using fabrics that perform like nothing you've ever worn before ... men's and women's underwear they supported nobody can guarantee comfortable staple way stands a range of fabric that are luxurious lease off by the moisture watching\nReasonable designed to move with you not against you Tommy John so confident in their underwear if you don't love your first pair you get a full refund with their best pair you'll ever where or it's free guarantee\nAnd that includes every life changing women's underwear which is now fully\nBack inside so go check out Tommy John's right now he's ... at Tommy John dot com right now to fourteen percent on your first or as political Shapiro for twenty percent off at Tommy John dot com again Tommy John dot com that's under way you can buy plus they have their best Perry you'll ever where or it's free guarantee there's no risk involved Tommy John dot com use that promote culture\nFor twenty percent off so how does a New Yorker undermined it's OK so they say here's a witness a witness who says she heard about Brett Kavanaugh exposing himself to a girl I Gail now again that's a different allegation then the you tried to sexually\nAssault somebody this is a bad drunken brat antics that is gross but it's not quite the same thing as pressing yourself on a girl and putting your hand over her mouth where there are gradations of evil this one is a little bit lower than the other one but there is a big problem with a New Yorker story\nOkay the New Yorker story says that this is actually what is that in the story quote\nApple said that he initially asked to remain anonymous because we hope to make contact person with a classmate who the best of his recollection told them about the party and it was an eyewitness the incident he said he had not been able to get any response from that person just played multiple attempts to do show the New Yorker reached a classmate but he said he had no memory of the incident\nSo in other words here's what the New Yorkers reporting here's our big bombshell this guy heard secondhand about a party which cabinet exposed himself without permission to grow\nAnd this guy said I'm not coming forward and talk to the guy told me the story the New Yorker actually identified that guy we supposedly witnessed the event and then when they talk to them and that guy said I don't remember anything about that\nWouldn't that actually be the end of the story like in a normal journalistic can wind up in the end of the story if I if I spoke to somebody and they said I heard a rumor from ... that this happened and he was an eye witness and then I when I spoke to the eyewitness and the eyewitness at night and I don't remember anything about that\nThat would be the end of the story the New Yorker ran with it anyway because this is the link which journalists will do you think Brett Kavanaugh's nomination and then that report and the New Yorker and gets even worse\nThe New Yorker wrote that some of Kavanaugh's classmate said he was bullied in high school who laughed at other kids there's a quote from New Yorker story\nIn his statement which is attorney does a another\nWitness in his statement which is attorney also sent several members in the Senate Judiciary committee on Tuesday he described cabinet as part of a click of high school athletes most of whom are on the football team who routinely picked on less physically fit\nOr popular students and said he never witnessed Kavanaugh physically attacking another student but he recalled in doing nothing to stop the physical and verbal abuse and said he said cabinet stood by and laughed at the victims\nDo what he was a jerk in high school was part of the popular kids click this coming from a guy who was deeply unpopular high school right I have no sympathy for guys who were bullies in high school or who stood by what bullying occurred in high school I have no sympathy for that 'cause I was a brutal victim of bullying when I was in high school but being a victim of bowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as long letter says we are professors who teach research and write about the judicial institutions of the country the question that issue is painful for anyone but judge Kavanaugh dip it exhibited they lack of commitment to judicial inquiry uh-huh so women it tore us RPG Ruth Bader Ginsburg grits on Trump and says you shouldn't be president that's not partisanship she deserves to sit on the court\nWhen judge Kavanaugh gets angry that people are calling him a gang rape is on open television\nAnd then that's obviously a reason that he shouldn't be on the court decades number two is that Brett Kavanaugh got mad oh no he got mad and that means that he shouldn't be on the court that means the Democrats have fallen back on their final case okay so fine okay but one of their their finally falling back on at the latest\nIs that judge Kavanaugh committed perjury so they were just saying that in his testimony judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a a bunch of wise you light a bunch of times but first of all let us to find what perjury is in the elements of the law is a false statement that had material to the proceedings that at the definition of perjury okay this is the the United States department Justice Department of justice\nStandard for perjury section Seventeen forty eight elements of perjury materiality the false statement must be material to the proceeding a false statement as material if it has a natural tendency to influence or capable of influencing the decision of the decision making body to which it was addressed testimony not had to actually influence misled or impeded the proceedings\nSo if you lie to impede grand juries line of inquiry then that would be a violation of perjury charges if you're President Clinton and you suggest you did not in fact have sex with that woman that is legitimate perjury\nBut that is not the same thing as you know you asked a question about whether it's note on a particular day you know it's not easy it rained and it has no actual material impact on the course of the investigation that's perjury okay that's not how we're so what are the ... the Brits have not supposedly all first of all\nIt is important to note that all of his testimony was given it in the context of him being accused of a gang rape by a bunch of Democrats and then they were digging through his your book so every claim that has been made about his wise has been that supposedly he downplayed his drinking or lives about his high school yearbook\nOr lives out of high school year but now I'm not going to defend lying I'm not going to pretend that Brett Kavanaugh lied about things I think that makes them squeaky clean let's go through a list of these oppose it lies that Brett Kavanaugh soldiers from bling bling bling going as far left site and so this means they're going to get\nAbout as comprehensive a view was is actually from media matters which is comprehensive use you can come up with of Brett Kavanaugh's lot\nSo what are these supposed ally have enough that he did not traveling the same social circles as board but he
