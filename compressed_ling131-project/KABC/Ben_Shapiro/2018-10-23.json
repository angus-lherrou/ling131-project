I sell right at last night it then it might not have done\nBecause I went every race and killing ...\nWell the reason why I ask is because I remember you walking out of award and it was almost like you would never seen\nThe troops will get ... ... yeah yeah it was almost like you know oh jeez what's going on here\nAnd I was almost embarrassed I remember that bringing you the book to ask you to

the time it was not that it'd be good news\nBlank so as you said some of the\nThings that uh we had to unload off the helicopters was the stuff that I don't think any of us even what I call the lifers the guys the the thirty and forty year old sergeants that had been in\nThe army forever I mean I don't think they were talking a yeah yeah I mean and to draftees that really didn't want to be there\nOf which I had a number of friends\nIt was really just something that I'm not surprised that we've set back a drug addicts and in my case alcoholics knock on wood I've stopped but you know

join us for the hours but you know in the end as\nYou said all those records all those cells but that human touch that show the real heart of county Francis and the and the real heart of America as Americans disagreed about the war\nAnd many good people disagreed the American people or many of them most of them treated our soldiers so poorly in kind of you did not and it was appreciated by our men in uniform it's still appreciate it today\nAnd thank you to carry thank you to Gary Wagner and thank you\nAnd I mean this sincerely if you're ever out in the Los Angeles area\nI'd love to buy you lunch or dinner\n[noise] okay scaring\nAnd thank you Gary and we bring these kinds of stories together here folks one of the great pop singers of all time\nThe guy who happens to be serving in Vietnam and the two of them need in a faraway place and show mutual love and mutual respect for one another county for instance the story Gary wagging her story a bit of the American story in the heart of one of our darkest times endorses wars\nHere on our American story [noise]\n\n\nOur American story Rajiv by NPR\nCountries got issues\nYou know vote on election day and a member of the\nThey should heroin

million Twitter followers that the first tunnel is almost done it will run paralleled has a puppet of boulevard for two point seven miles\nAnd now President Trump has soared in the approval ratings\nDemocrats still do lean on the question of which party should control Congress among poll respondents identified as likely voters fifty percent prefer Democrats forty one percent prefer Republicans which is about the same as was in last month's poll but a blue wave is now running into a rip tide of uncertainty according to some certain pole\nAlthough Democrats are preferred and the national poll overall here's the key their advantage has vanished in the house districts that matter most and districts rated as most competitive by the nonpartisan cook Political Report the parties are dead even on the question of which ones should control Congress\nThat means that in California Democrats are really fired up in New York Democrats are really fired up in Ohio\nNot quite as much or at least Republicans are just as fired up as Democrats are in Ohio in last month's poll is an amazing thing in last month's poll Democrats led by Thirteen percentage point among registered voters and six points among likely voters\nInterest in the election has jumped among many groups that tend to favor Democrats Latinos African Americans young people more than two thirds of black voters showed high interest in the election that's up from fifty seven percent and the average of polls taken from January through September\nBut you're also seeing a massive increase a massive increase among white voters among Republican voters\nAmong older voters it's consistent so we do not know what the cases you're but there is a massive gender gap in this massive gender gap is again the result of two things President Trump is talking to women and Democrats are toxic ...\nThere's a gender gap is not one factor it's not that Republican is not that men love Republicans and love President Trump because they hate women or anything like that if the President Trump is uniquely off putting to many women particularly suburban moms and the Democrats are supremely off putting to man and this is why you're seeing the polls close\nThe gender gap that is actually opened up wide and the last month is not between women\nAnd kind of normal electorate to men in the normal electorate men are now favoring Republicans in heavy numbers this poll found Democrats with a lopsided advantage among female voters for the second month in a row women in the survey said they prefer a Democrat controlled Congress by twenty five percentage points fifty seven thirty to which they massive gap\nMale voters however what Republicans to lead Congress by fourteen point margin fifty two percent Republican thirty eight percent Democrats\nAnd competitive swing districts are mostly in suburban areas\nUrban voters favor a democratic controlled Congress by thirty six percent margin rural voters they were the GOP by thirty one points\nAmong suburban residents the parties are virtually tied forty four percent favor GOP control forty five percent favor a Democratic Congress\nNow why because voters continue to trust the Republicans on the economy on trade issues Republicans are preferred by Seventeen point margin that's up from eight percent in August dish has been in the spotlight because President Trump was actually able to closing after deals with all of the talk about tariffs in trade wars and it's basically receded into the background\nDo all of this is good news for public does that mean Republicans hold the house\nIs still more unlikely than not but\nThis upsurge is is pretty amazing stuff for Republicans in the lead up\nTo image from election and again a lot of that has to do with the fact that the Democrats are just terrible at everything rigid they're terrible at everything I mean they're completely off putting on the most basic basic issues and that's what we are seeing none of the story of today's politics is is how off putting the Democrats are\nAnd Mitch McConnell for example like cocaine much as we're fond of calling it OK Mitch was eating at a restaurant who's confronted by protesters if this thing becomes consistent\nIs not good for the country and it is certainly not good for the Democratic party which seems to be embracing it in a way the Republican Party is not Nancy Pelosi was also confronted over the weekend and protesters shouted it hurt the differences high level Republicans condemned that\nI Love all Democrats are not doing a great job of condemning what's going on here look at these protesters confront cocaine mission Elaine Chao they're eating at a restaurant and I mean frankly there just lucky that cocaine Mitch didn't go ballistic on them and tell them to say hello to his little friends\nMany I don't know why you'd want to go up against cocaine ... it will ... out your eyes and feed use the ravens but this is what these protesters decided to do [laughter]\nAnd all the papers I get the hell out of here nobody likes you leave\nAnd this is why it's so funny I I've been asked before if anybody has ever confronted me at a restaurant or tried to make trouble at a restaurant and like no I ... it was one of my friends are you coming to a kosher restaurant and you tried to confront me these are all my buddies much security at the Jew crew\nAnd so we'll we'll fight you off but cocaine Mitch basically have that in Kentucky as well so he just activated his his goons to basically buy back and get these guys just by sitting there\nThe cool collected turtle got all of it and meanwhile Democrats determined to show that they are just as many as you think they are in other ways as well\nThey've decided that they don't work is most important person on planet earth he's deeply important why they decide to bail rocket important I have no idea they're trying to say that he's sort of like rock Obama except without half the charm or the racial appeal but they're still trying to manufacture this this kind of quasi enthusiasm for me to work\nAnd then there was a report from ABC News that really fond over him last night but the best stuff the best stuff from these campaigns and it was true for President Trump and it's a thing I just buys most about politics generally is for Obama and from anybody who has any level of political notoriety has a certain number of fans were completely crazy\nAnd those fans do completely crazy things in public\nWearing T shirts or lining up ... I mean one of the show you in just a second because it's ... bad and really embarrassing and you got to imagine that these folks the day after the election they wake up and they go what was I thinking\nWhoa really was this what I wanted to do with my life when I was when I was well this image that I wanted to project to the world will get to all that in just a second but first\nLet's talk about your underwear ... fall is here and as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade or reach Dr drawers with all new fall colors in print from Tommy John Tommy John obsesses over every little detail in which\nThese proprietary fabric to perform like nothing you'll ever war before as a result Tommy John men's and women's underwear sporting ... guarantee would've been useful in high school comfortable stay put waste and a range of fabric that are luxurious lease off by the white moisture ... reasonable and designed to move with you\nNot against you that means no bunting know riding up Tommy John it's so confident in their underwear that if you don't love at first there you get a full refund with their best pair you'll ever where or it's free guarantee do what\nIf you got to lose that includes a new life changing women's underwear no fully back in ... before you spend another dime on cheap heat trapping multi past underwear remember there's no better way to take care of the good then Tommy John no adjustment needed\nHurry to Tommy John dot com right now you probably could have been for twenty percent off your first order that his ... for twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com Tommy John dot com again used from Quebec for twenty percent off\nWhen I say folks have have made fools of themselves for middle rock I remember back in two thousand eight when the Democrats actually had small children singing hymns you President Obama then candidate Obama now Democrats\nAre have gone even beyond that here is a bunch of ... reporters I don't know why doing YMCA buy me a T o in unison it's not good [laughter]\nKnow what I Love about this is the the move that was made by Democrats debate or rock draws an incredibly diverse crowd\nIf you can't see this this is all white people in a small girl that's really what it is it's like all a bunch of old white people who can barely move it looks like workout night at the local old age home I mean it looked like it does when you actually go down to the YMCA and you see the people who are sixty in the water doing physical therapy\nExcept they're doing ... for Senate\nSo that was strong but that was not the strongest country in the ... worshipped him know\nAnd the strongest entry comes courtesy of some crazy ladies who decided to cut the weirdest video I've seen in this election cycle well I Can't say that I mean I've seen some weird videos and electric political again but this one is pretty astonishing here we go I don't even know what this is\nBut listen if you can bear to\nFree by\n[laughter]\n\n\nTitle nine ... gender discrimination in federal programs and the proposed move by the age H.

worth his salt had they bore it can enforce apparently they are a lot of folks in the media unless you don't want the United states and forced its borders President Trump is a great so President Trump has responded to this rolling caravan of migrants that have left\nLatin America are moving up into Mexico Latin in Central America and looking up electrical\nAnd toward the United states border he has responded I think properly by pointing out a couple of things one we need more security to the countries that are allowing them to do that\nAre doing so with the intent of creating a pressure situation on our southern border why should we continue funding governments that are going to continue creating the situation if the hunter and government is going to allow folks to simply walk over the border to Mexico with the intention belong to the United states why exactly when we leave the funding that government\nSame thing is for the Mexican government take things for the south Korean government there is no reason for us to back governments that are going to create pressures on our southern border without actively working with us on the immigration issue\nPresident from his full efforts are being made without the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border people have to apply for asylum and Mexico first and if they fail to do that the U.S will turn them away the courts are asking us to do things that are not doable\nThat's correct that's correct we do have procedures one of the problems here that you can actually show up\nAt a point to that and you can apply for asylum that's legal way to do that that's not what these turbines are doing some of these terrorists are simply finding places that are open in the United states border and crossing their\nFrom says the ... the Democrat Party changed the immigration laws now\nNow I'm not sure what immigration laws wants to change the typically\nWe actually just have to enforce the laws that are already on the books are not allowed to illegally enter the country we are allowed to the poor people we can streamline that process maybe those in large wants change but it is true that the Democratic party has been using the immigration issue with the clause against Republicans and guessing the Republicans don't care about Latino folks because they want to defend America's forests\nThat argument isn't working very well specifically because a lot of Latinos in the United states are also interested in living in a country with more they're not interested in living in a country or anyone can go and come and they see fit one of the great live in the media is that everyone agrees with an open borders agenda virtually no one in the United states actually agreed with an open borders agenda\nAnd it's pretty obvious that there is an actual agenda to the hair of ants organize not only is it or not just organized for the camera ... report hundreds of migrants\nI'd for refugee status and Mexico in the southern city of should that his all go by Sunday evening the Interior Department reported it had received more than a thousand requests but most of them were not doing it say far bigger reported the sushi river from Guatemala to the Mexican side individually and dozens at a time and resume to track at first light marching ten abreast on the highway\nHe said what do they chanted in Spanish yes we did\nWell we don't have to let those people cross the border the throne grew even larger when the migrants arrived at the border British falling overnight to five thousand it was not immediately clear where the additional travelers came from and it's about two thousand had been gathered on the Mexican side Saturday Night\nPresumably some of those folks are from Mexico they're not necessarily from countries to the south of Mexico their destination on Sunday was city of ... in the ... state under a blazing sun small groups of twenty thirty plus arresting the shade of trees on the side of the road by afternoon the caravan had evolved in long lines walkers traveling for miles\nBasically what this looks very much like is the middle eastern migration that has swam a lot of Europe that's what this looks like just visually now the numbers are not the same obviously as you're seeing from immigration from North Africa and the middle east into islands off the coast of Italy\nBut the image the reason the same it's a group of folks are trying to escape a worse life and simply cross the border illegally into the United states again the United states is a sovereign nation we can't afford to simply taking everybody that we would want to take in\nOut of economic necessity\nOr out of out of some sort of of sympathy for the folks crossing the border you cannot have a country that is the strongest economy on planet earth taking in thousands and thousands of people illegally without letting them know without any sort of skill set that does not make for good economy this is one of the reasons why it's so funny both on the left they love Norway they loved and market let's we'd\nImmigration restriction is have been winning in Norway Denmark and in Sweden\nYou cannot actually have a blonde socialist state in terms of redistribution of wealth when\nYou have an underclass that it's coming that does not have the skills that one of one of the things about\nThose ... the ... the country and Scandinavian countries is that they've basically banned immigration will the United states the left in the United states wants it both ways they want on open immigration at the same time that they want to raise social spending like never before seen in human history that is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on that even Lindsey Graham was a real job on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously one of the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration from even he said listen this is not something we can do Nancy Pelosi would welcome the Caribbean I don't know what happened Lindsey Graham whether\nWe bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham to point out the ... is really
