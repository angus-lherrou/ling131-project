{"content": "So where did Chris get the idea to remake what was then a major blockbuster released in the early eighties\nHe shows was all just about kids having fun the whole\nSort of originating idea was really bored out of more of a role playing than it was a it was a fantasy it was yeah creative project ensued and in a in a life long collaboration in suit but I don't think it was ever like [noise]\nI don't think an editor minds you know like we sat down and thought okay well we're about to put a hole in the next seven years of our allies into\nA creative project what else do you want to work on you know what other what other things that this is what we're doing and we're kind of going for it and [noise] and we had a long no idea how long it was going to take us so we sort of dove and and did it so I don't\nI don't know if we had that spectrum of creative thinking yet I think it was just like hey this is that this is what we're doing would that be exciting if we just sort of went after it with that\nHow did these kids in southern Mississippi back in the early eighties pull it off Eric explains that wasn't really\nAs a ah eleven and twelve year old respectively growing up\nIn Mississippi in the eighties pre Internet you know how do you really make a twenty six million dollar\nMovie on your allowance you know we knew nothing about it in and\nFor the first year some kind of figuratively speaking corrupt right on the darkness as far as figuring out how you do that you know I wrote\nA six hundred page shot list and then it got to the end\nAnd realized was early worthless you know\nClose up and he walks in the room I mean what are you going to do with that and and then figure out okay no story boards that's how the professionals do it yeah yeah and it was sort of by us most is a filmmaking on the fly\nDon't making on the fly can sometimes get a little dangerous especially when kids are in charge one day there was a fire on the ...\nMost of the terrorists we shot in my mom's basement shut this big rambling basement multiple rooms so uh we would\nWe'd only shoot in the summertime um you know it's like summer camp you know we we do production pre production during the school year but during the summer that was our time so I'm\nThink a hundred and twenty percent humidity typical Mississippi summer day um start early and um [noise]\nAnd a son her down to the basement where [noise]\nMade up like a Nepalese saloon my dad's old wine bottles lining the are lining the or the shelves and and Jason are cameramen as wiring up scripts and go off in the wall um [noise]\nAnd uh\nWe have a you know the the Nepalese saloon nearly burns down down\nOur moms and shut us down to the previous summer because well they want to show me with my back on fire and for some reason I've had a problem with that [noise] um so they let us continue with a two words adult chaperone found an adult even less responsible than we were\nHe helped us a guy to do when you know there wasn't a fire in certain edges of the frame you know more or gasoline over there so I Wonder if we didn't bring house down don't try this at home catch\nWhen making a film be it in Hollywood or Mississippi there are several stages of production there's pre production shooting and post\nAnd here again is Eric on the reproduction efforts to build this monumental tribute shown\nFirst summer was entirely nothing but pre production drawn story board scouting locations casting costumes props year or two we finally shot kept none of it because again we didn't know anything about so making [noise]\nSo there's very few shots at that we actually kept from that first year but there are certain scenes that we just would she over and over and over again\nThrough a trial and error we slowly picked up\nThings about learning about composition lighting blocking acting and bit by bit we got better and only when we're satisfied with the quality of a shot [noise] you know the scene when we move onto the next\nYou know these kids are obviously determined to get to filming but there was another major hurdle that they will have to overcome back in the early eighties and that was just simply having access to the film that they were trying to recreate\nWe only actually saw the movie a few times you know a\nPretty much from memory for the first handful of years until the film actually came out on laser disc and a four and so we cobbled together\nAbsolutely everything that we could in terms of you know raiders paraphernalia you know a story books and magazines and and bubblegum cards and and all that stuff the comic book and the screenplay an end to the best of our memories sat down and and Eric [noise]\nYou know chiseled out well over six hundred individuals story boards that we'd then used as a blueprint but we you know we went back to the theater as much as that we could [noise]\nYou know for those of us who remember the eighties there were there in video stores were really in there into the city that you couldn't really go down and read whatever you want it you know\nUm there was an availability issue you know and and that was a movie when they could re release things so in the movie was released in the theater we went back and watched it you know again as much as our\nAllowance would allow\nFor the boys ended up finishing their seen by scene remake of regions of the Lost Ark with their big premier at an auditory\nThe local Coca Cola bottling plant in Gulfport, Mississippi August twelfth Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\nErin de la and Jason land just finished an eight year recreate\nThe trio premier their version of the even the raiders of the last time\nI have to make a film and TV [noise] it's the hardest thing I've ever done so far\nWe've been following this story up in the past three years after the by turning back the hands of time they take one [noise]\nIt was shut out of sequence of due to his lung filming period many actors randomly appear at different ages throughout the course of the film he completed every scene in the film except for one\nToo complicated and expensive for the kids to convince him we pull off it's the scene from raiders were Indiana Jones isn't a fist fight with the big bomb nuts you next to an airplane with rotating propellers at the last moment when India is getting his ass kicked the Nazi gets hit by the planes propeller\nAnd shredded into a million bloody pieces that splattered all over the side of the earth\nA pretty good ethics shuttering it's only\nSeen the kids couldn't match after setting mom's basement on fire it was probably a good idea to nix to death by propeller seen\nThe boys went their separate ways going off to college in the film was largely forgotten till two thousand three when the film producer got his hands on the copy the remake\nHere's Chris on the film getting discovered all those years later\nI didn't even tell my wife is an Indiana Jones said so she had no idea that I had even done this raiders thing and so when it got discovered in two thousand and three and like exploded you know and got us into Vanity Fair and we're all sudden touring around the United states and going to Germany and Australia and you know\nMy wife has like um so what's his raiders thing you know they like let me see it you know like\nA it's like this thing that I did and you know I still have that like [noise]\nThat reaction and she did this is cool this is great\nSo this little remake of raiders of the Lost Ark born out of this sweltering summer heat of the Mississippi swamp country a couple of kids with nothing better to do [noise] suddenly have the attention of hauling\nEach of us um received very kind letter from Mr Spielberg thanking us for our very loving and detailed tribute and uh\nYou know ... very stages of opening a letter and just sort of like\nGazing down on stationary Steven Spielberg and you know [noise]\nSignature and you know this my boyhood hero who I spend my entire childhood\nEmulating his his work um [noise]\nCan't get any better than this but I was wrong um you know jump forty year and we've been screening and written up in a family affair and uh we're in Los Angeles doing the today show and a late Late Show with ... born in\nAnd get a call from our agents have an agent now I'm Still break wants to meet you in his office tomorrow I knew\nI was doing OK handling all this up to this point but now I feel kind of sick\nAnd the you're twenty fourteen Christian Eric raised enough money to go back and film that scene that they couldn't quite pull off is twelve year olds\nDoes completed the childhood project that started back in Nineteen eighty to be sure to check out the documentary about\nThis ... story I'm\nThe story of the greatest fan films\nI'm Jesse ... is our American story\n\nOur American story brought to you by NPR [noise]\nLos Angeles orange\nCumulus station [noise] K. A. B.\nC. news live in local at nine o'clock I'm just a little note tickets sold here in California ... six numbers that came up in tonight's one billion dollar mega millions drawing\nThe numbers drawn work Fifteen twenty three fifty three sixty five Seventy and the mega ball with seven there was no word yet if any winning tickets were sold in the rest of the country but none were sold the here and the Golden State\nAgain there are more on woman playbook from two thousand twelve and they're doing it in a more intense way now that Hillary would be a very bad fit for that playbook and cut the Democrats\nAnd their mind so she'd be a bad fit for the war on women play both because she legitimately fought a war on every woman that that her husband harassed abused slept with and she she literally did that for a solid Fifteen Twenty years of her career\nBut because she is woman we last year her roar and you can see that the radical feminists are out in force they think that this is their time\nWhen I say radical feminist radical feminist the best radical feminist piece of the day comes courtesy of Tory ... over at slate dot com that are positive story for much\nOf American stupidity is the actual title of the ... the rage of all women okay there's a quote from the beach this isn't me being homophobic as a quote from the ... is the worst thing you can call lesbian but in the meat you era it's time to reclaim it\nOkay what do you mean tore through straight well she will tell you in the wake of the cabinet hearing a dyke friend in her twenties posted that real talk she doesn't like men I hit the like button super fast feeling secretive and sort of guilty about it she'd come through the same radical we're in France circles I came up and and then that click I felt relieved to acknowledge an obvious truth\nMost men free within like something less than human whether accidentally on purpose and that means it's hard to like them\nMen are bad men are evil solid political argument I can see that you're you're aiming for a political victory here by immediately alienating half the population\nAnd recently been scanning the men coming into my workplace wondering about their histories and sexual assault yeah it's a normal thing to do\nAs a real normal thing to do send your house and have you done that at the office\nYou just walk and you're like I Wonder who here as rape someone okay so I I stand corrected tenure so she does this every day in any case\nThis woman says if you read this what about him where does he fall on the ... scale it was an old impulse that had returned enforced as a nation debating just how many of their husbands brothers and sons were perpetrators given that one in three American women experience sexual violence in their lifetimes\nOkay again that is a very very vague definition of sexual violence if you're suggesting that one and three women in America is raped over the course of her life that it's just not that it's not it from statistic and it's just they fall statistic\nIs Republicans insisted that men were the ones who should be afraid when women were counted the everyday heroin ways we room re route are live to avoid assault my walk male co workers need me to joke as if the whole thing real funny spectacle was enough to make me want to stop talking to men entirely\nI have a feeling that the feeling was mutual yet still inside my head and not on then course roared what about the dad to like all my angry tweet\nOr the guy who showed up at the hospital too much food when my spouse and labor or my friends who are transmitted\nThat's where it gets really confusing when you actually I'm a woman who says she's a man I supposed to hate her for being a man or it's supposed to like her for being a woman does when things get really baffling for folks on the left\nPatriarchy runs so deep that I defend hypothetical men's feelings right away even to myself I'm a married lesbian as far away from needing male approval as a woman can get and I still feel it the slow while he's in a strip of cultural conditioning and tells me to prioritize men\nActually that cultural conditioning says you might want to treat human beings like you know individual human beings because they're human beings just my imagination that thing that could break us out of American fascism\nYour imagination is not going to break anybody out of anything\nI mean it's not even a break you ought to be asylum lady\nJust it's trapped in an old feminist loop because I've been framed the worst thing I can beat is a man hating dike but it's time to confront the late and homophobia and that and so it's not late and homophobia is an actual just homophobic into that and it's not late and about that interested in our fear that anger makes us seemed to gay because anger not fear is precisely the emotion that need these days\nThe where the person who said that anger is the proper response to your life the people who say that anger is the proper response to the generalized situation in your life that\nPerson is not going to you that advice my ... has a great praised his anger is the devils cocaine I think that it's basically correct and then if you are looking at your life and you don't have a specific instance of injustice to point to generalize outrage about the world\nYou're going to fail in life a great way to fail and life is do you think yourself into a generalized feeling that you will never be able to succeed especially in a free country it's one thing to say that in a dictatorship but this is a free country and world history I mean this lady is writing a piece about how much she hates men in the pages of a national newspaper basically\nAnd probably being champion for it by a bunch of folks on the left the radical feminist movement is in full swing and this is why Hillary Clinton could still come back because it would be easy for Hillary to say\nThe real reason I lost was radical sexism and then try and drive out single women to the polls in high numbers to take advantage against Donald Trump when you get more incidents\nIn just one second but first let's talk about your bathroom habits how are you getting ready to go out tonight a shower and wash the workday away are you selling your hair brushing your teeth are you a human being I'm\nAsking because as a proud member of dollar shave club I'm here to tell you no matter what you do to get ready dollar shave has everything you need to look feel and now you're about\nTaking your lunch all day it's really gross which is why you ought to use the intense peppermint flavor of yes he's toothpaste\nYou'll leave your mouth feeling refreshed and it will last ditch surprisingly long time there hydrated ... wash the workday

centers that partnership regular price get yours today a dollar shave club dot com slash then that dollar shave dot com slash then\nThe the anger that has broken out on the radical feminists left is good for Hillary Clinton obviously it's also good for folks like Kamala Harris\nOn the intersection ... scale radical feminists are trying to push women up that scale right now there's a philosophy that I talk about a lot on the show\nOn the left that says that we can prioritize people's viewpoints based on their genetic based on their ancestry based on their ethnicity based on their class is so basically here's how this hierarchy goes of abuse that we should respect it goes it goes like oh you mean the person black person Hispanic person woman\nAsian person Jewish person white person that's how it goes up the hierarchy and women are similar in the middle as I mentioned right there ... kinda behind Hispanic but I had an agent\nAnd then that's where women are so what radical feminist are trying to do is elevate women in the hierarchy of victimhood higher up the ladder and that way folks like Hillary Clinton and have a better shot at being elected by claiming victim but this is why it because women aren't high enough on me as her sexuality scale you saw Elizabeth Warren trying to claim Native American ancestry\nBecause you're saying it's not enough for me to be a woman and Democratic primary I also have to claim membership in a historically victimized group I'm also a Native American\nThat of course fell apart for ... so if you can't if you can't beat the answer sexuality course he joined the intersection LA course radical feminist are trying to elevate women as victims in American society\nAnd so this this woman as late as crazy as she sounds the story through straight who says that she wants to be a ... that you basically wants to be part of the she woman man hitters club\nLike within the reverse of the of the gang from uh from alfalfa you know she when she says this is not actually that far out of the realm of the mainstream in certain democratic turtles I loved the here's another example Carolyn ... an advice columnist over at the Washington Post\nAnd there's a letter here's a letter your Carolyn I have a daughter and some other moms and daughters and I started getting together and local playground and a set time each week\nRecently among them away brought her son to the playground at the same time we were there I asked her nicely I thought she would mind leaving because we wanted to be a girls only time she refused and seemed angry at me\nIf she comes back is there a better way I can approach an approach her this has been such a sweet time for moms and daughters and having a boy there is naturally going to change things we live in a world where boys get everything in girls are left with problems\nAnd I wouldn't think this mom would realize that but she seems to think our son is entitled to crash this girl's only time I don't can't legally keep her from a public park but can I appealed to her better nature\nAnd then the response was showing off the mom and her boy was terrible but I have to admit that I actually have a little bit of sympathy for the mom not in the sense that you should drop the boys but boys do change the dynamic when girls are playing\nI based on I have a daughter and I play very very differently when boys go to a girls only go to the changes that I doubt it boys are different than girls radical something just want to have\nAnywhere in the rest of the country us see has agreed to a two hundred
