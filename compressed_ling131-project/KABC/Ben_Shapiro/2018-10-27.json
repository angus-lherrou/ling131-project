County\n... station [noise]\nKABC news live and local at nine o'clock I'm Liz Warner\nOf justice has announced the arrest of fifty six year olds phase are Saudi off the Florida\nBernie Sanders responsible for the crazy guy no Bernie Sanders was not responsible for the crazy guy now if you want to say if someone like let's say that President Trump supporter wet and just punch the protester\nI Would say OK lot closer linkage between the rhetoric President Trump has used and that particular action just as I say there's a lot closer to language to linkage between Maxine Waters thinking\nIn public places and Democrats willing and confronting people in public places incitement one activity is not necessarily incitement to sending bombs in the mail or shooting people off on a congressional baseball field\nBut the media have leapt to a particular conclusion Bernie Sanders and two thousand Seventeen was completely innocent of what this guy did agree and then they say well a crazy person like an obvious crazy person is President Trump's responsibility what happened here and that is absolutely a bunch of crap\nIt's dangerous crap to it is because here's the left as a bluff says if the climate of polarization the climate has gotten June nasty in this country it's just a bad nasty climate of polarization that we have here in the United states and that's all President Trump's fault\nSo maybe we ought to censor what people on the writer saying maybe one claim that people on the right are uniquely evil\nDo they understand that that claim actually radicalized yourself at the best thing if they were there were two sided about this and they were objective about that is what they said was listen everybody needs to tone down their rhetoric Bernie Sanders needs to tone down the rhetoric Democrats need to tone down the rhetoric Republicans need to tone down the rhetoric then at least they're consistent\nIvan thing that I didn't think that for literally years on this program I've been saying that\nBut that's not what the media are saying with the media are saying is that every time a democratic whack job does something if the fault\nOf democratic last job every time Republican ... does something if the ultimate all Republicans across the country and that is going to drive people not and it's going to make people less likely to tone down the rhetoric is as likely to make more people anti media\nThey all this talk about radicalizing people against the media the media don't read President Trump's help for that they do it pretty well themselves and they don't mean that President Trump ought to be saying what he's saying it does mean that the Democrats in the media are\nAbsolutely radicalizing the population of people on the other side by claiming falsely that everyone on the other side is responsible for the action of somebody who is clearly in saying\nThis stuff is really really gross and the media were doing this in advance right they're prepping this narrative for legitimately days in advance of the actual discoveries or we'll get you the Republicans and what they did wrong here due to the President Trump's response to this was really really idiotic but\nLet me show you some of the CNN Cairo on that were preemptively attacking President Trump when they didn't even know who this guy was\nSo this was from yesterday and the host is standing in front of a a screen that says men hunt for serial bomber and then it has profiles in various people like ... cents than Eric Holder Maxine Waters Robert De Niro Joe Biden and then underneath here's what the current that men hunt for serial bomber going after Trump target\nThe idea here is that President Trump somehow deputy ties this crazy person to send bombs in the mail is that was president from doing it CNN was saying this openly and we're trying to hide the ball here here's another Iran\nAnd that is a reporter on screen from the White House and it says underneath CNN from has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber\nWhy would he have ... plans to claim personal responsibility for inciting a serial bomber to Bernie Sanders claim that he had responsibility for inciting a serial shooter\nIs there like really is there any evidence that President Trump inside of this guy and he said if he's a male to this guy saying you know the awesome he sends and pipe bombs Maxine Waters but this is exactly what CNN was claiming\nAnd you wonder white folks on the right don't trust me this is built on the right\nDon't trust the media like it's just it's absurd there's Maxine Waters a person who would generally has said it in the past few months these you'd get in people's faith\nIn causing violent ways in public places on politics and now she's ripping into President Trump and saying he should take responsibility for obviously crazy person by the way this is why I object to all the false flag garbage that so many on the right we're feeling right out of the gate\nBecause my feeling is that the obvious answer to this was it was a crazy person you know who send bombs to people in the mail\nHigh profile people in the mail bombs that don't work properly you know who does that crazy people in the here's Maxine Waters lending president from Maxine Waters probably the most volatile and the most violent rhetoric using Democrat in the United States Congress here she is blaming Trump for all that\nI think the presidents of the United states has been don't listen to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there and I think that they're acting out let's say believe the president wants them to do and the way that he wants them to add\nOkay that's crazy okay the idea that Trump wants people send bombs in the mail is insane but that's totally what Maxine Waters would would pay you would expect her to say that this sort of one side of the coverage that leads people not to trust the media and now the media are not responsible for people sending bombs to them but the media are responsible for increasing a volatile climate\nAnd they blame President Trump for increasing the bottle climate I agree President Trump certainly has not tamped down the volatile climate but the media are part of that volatile climate and they're making it more volatile not less volatile and the fact that they are denying that demonstrates their completely out of touch with reality\nI'm more on that plus more information on the on these suspect on the alleged bomber but first let's talk about the fact that at some point here hopefully in a while you're going to die I Know that stuff but you actually do any life insurance in case you do plots because you don't want to leave your family\nAnd

content including pictures and videos purportedly films at one of the president's political rally the Twitter feed is littered with far right conspiracy theories are violent threat\nAimed at some of President Trump's most outspoken critic of repeatedly tweeted about George Soros\nAt one point he purportedly wrote you will vanish and it's we aimed at the billionaire source is one of the people who

bomb friend and she doesn't do the ruling in that case was not immediately clear on friday he was also convicted effect in twenty fourteen and twenty Thirteen and battery in twenty Thirteen and twenty wildly file for bankruptcy and declared in court filing he lived with his mother\nSo yeah clearly the President Trump's fault obviously this is all President Trump is Twitter feed is gross he's a gross person I I Can't believe it just a shock but again\nThe fact that he is not is not going to stop the Democrats in trotting out the why that it's Republicans who caused all this joy ... routine to preemptively she said that the entire GOP is to blame for a crazy person who lived with his mother was\nRussian for bomb threats sixteen years ago and then arrested a bunch of times in the past

you're going to have to recognize that this sort of heightened political rhetoric exist on all sides because if you don't then you are lying or being dishonest and you are now I'm not saying that it's happening equally on all sides\nI Am saying that it is happening on all sides and we all need to take it down a bit\nIf we're going to talk about heightened political rhetoric we have to talk about it in an accurate way they're not doing that and media are not doing that and that is creating blowback against the media they finally here's how you can here's how you can really not stuck at all of this\nStart to start to think about whether the stuff that you say is more likely to raise the temperature or lower the temperature is raising the temperature maybe you should think about whether it's appropriate to raise the temperature sometimes but sometimes it's not\nI'm hoping that the country somehow comes back with us is here but I fear that that's not going to happen I fear that me are going to rip all Republicans for this sort of activity Republicans are going to simply claim false flag or simply going to blame Democrats for similar sort of activity and then we got a cycle that been down in the garbage\nFrom here until the end of time that doesn't happen that doesn't have to happen crazy people do crazy things separately immoral rhetoric is immoral certainly not all immoral rhetoric incentivized violence and fourth week maybe we should tone down the moral rhetoric regardless of whether it incentivized violence\nWe do all those things you can have a country if not than we are in serious serious trouble now\nSpeaking of nonsense that's being pushed by the press\nThe the press coverage of the caravan is is really quite astonishing so NBC News I mean speaking of media bias when president from person to media bias and then folks in media say there is no such thing as media bias how dare he attacked media NBC News made there had her on Twitter an actual picture an actual picture\nOf the caravan of migrants ... that is simply propaganda that is not news that is propaganda that is these are victims these are people who are approaching the border and this is President Trump's fault and then you see the the rhetoric on the caravan issue obviously being being exaggerated on both sides so there was President Trump tweeting about the caravan issued yesterday\nNow explain what's wrong with us because when I first read that we didn't really know it was wrong with it and then I looked into a little more and there's a problem with this week\nIn sort of effect is correct but in but in practice it's wrong to President Trump to adapt to those in the care of and turn around we're not letting people into the United states illegally but back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nBut people pointed out that the people who are trying to get to the southern border of the United states are applying for asylum you can't do that unless you're already in the United states or the U.S more you can actually apply for political asylum from the country of origin\nHowever President Trump the actual suggesting is that these people are not actually looking for political asylum instead they're looking for economic opportunity which means that they would be fraud you won't be filing papers if they were seeking political asylum when they were really looking for economic opportunity to go home\nApplied the right way I don't think there's anything wrong with Trump's and go home and apply the right way but if the idea that if you legal for them to approach the southern border and apply for asylum that of course is not true either what is also not true is that the United states has an obligation to take an everyone who wants to cross the border no matter what\nWhere they come from or what their motivation is John ... back and he says that God he's spoken to God\nNow as a religious person who speaks of God three times a day got doesn't talk back to me but I talking to a fairly often like a lot okay but apparently got does talk to John ...\nAnd it's funny how left for a mock Mike Pence when he says that he has to prey on things in order to make a decision but when John cases mouthing leftist platitudes in the name of God that is totally fine here's John Kades dressing that God doesn't want us imposing the Caribbean\nAnd let's stop putting up walls around ourselves and not understanding the plight the trouble and the problems of others it is not right and the lord doesn't want it and our people ask\nTheir hearts wants to reach out to others look what they do in these storms they go and they refer people they don't know they put them in their homes they feed them that's
