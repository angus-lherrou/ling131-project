Monica McLean was the woman who was mentioned by Christine Blasey Ford's ex boyfriend in his letter when he said that Christine Blasey Ford train somebody to pass a polygraph\nThat would've been Monica McLean ... McLean when she was trying out for a job with the federal government\nShe then said that that had never happened it also turns out that amount of ... is probably the quote unquote beach friend that Christine Blasey Ford was talking about who urged her to approach Democrat Joe ... who the Democratic activist was involved in that thing basically from inception\nThe statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr Ford's allies are working behind the scenes to lobby old classmate to bolster their versions of the alleged incident as we're judge Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination will be debated in the Senate friday has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct\nOn Thursday adapt or sending to the White House report on its investigation into the allegations against judge Kavanaugh the FBI sent the White House and Senate an additional package of information that included text messages from this Micheline to miss Kaiser according to a person's a million with the matter\nIs Micheline lawyer David ... said in a statement hold\nAny notion of claim that ms McLean pressured wheeling Kaiser to alter miss Kaiser's account of what she recalls concerning the alleged incident between Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely fall\nIs Kaiser's lawyer on September twenty third sending a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee she had no recollection of attending a party with judge Kavanaugh that same day she told the Washington Post she believed Dr Ford on September twenty nine two days after Dr Ford and the judge testified before the Senate Judiciary committee miss Kaiser's attorneys sent a letter to the panel saying his client wasn't refuting back and forth to count\nAnd then she believed it couldn't corroborate at\nA person close to the former classmate said it was her understanding and mutual friends have Dr Ford and ms Sizer including Mr McLean had contacted missed Kaiser after her initial statement\nHer that her statement was being used by Republicans are about the allegations against judge Kavanaugh the friends told them as Kaiser that if she had intended to say she didn't remember the party not that it had never happened she should clarify her statement the person said adding that the friends had not in fact pressured miss Kaiser\nNo it wasn't any pressure at all so good stuff happening there from the from the politically oriented legal team and friends of Christine Blasey Ford\nThis is a not obviously good for her account\nObviously Chuck Grassley is taking this up very seriously so Chuck Grassley who is the was the head of the Senate Judiciary committee on behalf of the Republican you actually sent a letter to Christine Blasey Ford legal team and this letter is pretty explosive stuff for Christine Blasey Ford he basically said why don't you turning over any of your records\nYou testified about your your psychiatrist records and then you won't turn them over to us you know show them to the Washington Post won't show them to you testified about a bunch of material that you will turn over to us so why why won't you turn over any of that stuff\nHere's what Chuck Grassley wrote to Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer quote repeatedly refused to produce this evidence for the Senate in doing so your preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to the doctor for delegation\nI don't know what other interference we should drop from inference we should draw from your refusal but at the withheld evidence does not support doctor for delegation in quite the way you were playing I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nAnd here's where it starts to get real life he for legal team poured\nIn addition to the evidence I requested my October second letter\nAnd later recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or representative in any of the following one US Senators or their staff particularly the offices of ... senators Feinstein Hirono other than your communications with me and my staff in preparation for this September twenty seven hearing in other words\nWere you coordinating with Democrats in order to try it out a particular PR line to the alleged witnesses identified by Dr four wheeling Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith\nIn other words we think that you've been corresponding with witnesses including Leland Kaiser about what they ought to be saying on that and three Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating it or the representatives in other words were you coordinating with other people making allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nChuck Grassley does not actually released that letter unless he's got some things back pocket and Chuck Grassley is a very cautious center and this is not a guy who's going to go out there on a ledge and then to just that all of his his is some giant conspiracy without some evidence V. isn't as inappropriate\nSo we will see what arises from all of that by the way\nWe're athletes office did release an executive summary of the FBI finding the FBI findings\nBasically said that there was nothing when they talk to eleven different individual centerfold agreed to be interviewed that includes mark judge PJ Smith ... or as well as other individuals included on judge Kavanaugh's July first Nineteen eighties your calendar entry remember Democrats were suggesting that on\nOn Capitol talent or there was a party for July first Nineteen eighty two and what you listen to some people some of those people had crossover with some of the people mentioned by blades you forward even leaving for lawyers announcing it wasn't the July first party\nFunny how they only say that after the FBI interviews all these folks are the batteries all these folks and then and then for the words come out and say she would never have said that it was July first as possible date some of the people listening on his calendar she knew well and would have remembered ... interesting interesting how that works so again\nNever suggested not one that she was lying or making this up I don't know the answer to that I Do know that suspicious political activity around an allegation makes me more suspicious of the allegation than it otherwise would and just a second we'll get to the chaos that is happening\nOn the hill right now but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on

so\nWe'll get to the chaos that's been happening in Washington DC in just one second first I think it's worthwhile noting that having lost on all counts you are the Democrats have turned their final gamut they said that Brett Kavanaugh was a perjure and then they send the Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist and now they're saying Brett Kavanaugh cried and that makes him a baby\nIs it I'm I'm Serious there's an article in the New Yorker by person named Michael ... who apparently is is kind of a well a person repeats garbage on a regular basis\nHere's what he said Brett Kavanaugh spheres make a kind of sent from a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson that public life is about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the fulfillment of the white American man's Adam eyes desires as soon as a force of a fear and became the ultimate purpose of this country's society\nSo if you don't understand what he's talking about that because you have a brain what he's trying to say here is that the phrase pursuit of happiness means that white men get to pursue happiness but everybody else is a giant victim and therefore if you believe in the declaration of independence because you're a racist which is an insane statement\nAnd then he says if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis in his body and his body politic both\nReally that's weird because it seems to me that rape laws have been on the books and for ever since all of human history written into America's founding document is the franchise for men like have not a week when he isn't fulfill\nThat isn't really in the current condition that not really have you read it is in this was a citizen of his society then one of his disgruntled customers were always right there's an originalist arguments to be made for being a cry baby so it's bad to Brett Kavanaugh got emotional not what I Would love it\nSherman was association that people who endured and very much for that we
