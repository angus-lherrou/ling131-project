for years were spent refining and tore were spent in the wild success [noise] my most persistent memory of stand up as of my mouth being in the president's\nIn my mind being in the future amounts speaking the lime the body delivering adjuster for the mind look back observing analyzing judging worrying\nAnd then deciding women what's to say not enjoyment while performing was rare enjoyment would have been an indulgent loss of focus the comedy cannot afford\nAfter the show's however I experienced long hours of elation or misery depending on how the show went because doing comedy alone on stage is the egos last bam\nMy decade in the seventies with several years extending on either side\nThough my general recall the period as precise my memory of specific shows is being\nI stood on stage blinded by like looking into blackness which made every place the same\nDarkness as essential to fly just thrown on the audience they don't laugh\nI might as well have told them to sit still and be quiet the audience unnecessarily remained a thing unseen except for a few front rows where one shower pushed consumed me into panic um desperation\nThe comedian slang for a successful show is I

not naturally talented I didn't being dancer act do working around that minor detail made me inventive\nI was not self destructive though I almost destroyed myself\nIn the end I turned away from stand up with a tired swivel of my head I'm never looked back until now a few years ago I began researching and recalling the details at this crucial part of my professional life which was evidently touches upon my personal life and was reminded why I did stand up and\nWhy aren't either way\nFascinating and what a writer and we want to end where we started and let's go back to Steve Martin's comedy album

seven Ninety ... for the money starts falling from the sky at six and nine with Doug ... no with Dr Drew in Lawrence already with Jillian and John J. A. B. C. Los Angeles county of cumulus station [noise]\nTalk radio seven Ninety KBC news lived in local at nine o'clock I'm Joe Myers federal investigators are focusing on a Florida postal facility they suspect sent many of the suspicious\nPresident Trump is not responsible for the immediate response with us and I don't have to wait for the outcome to know that you know why because the sort of rhetoric that President Trump you had to have you\nI just like it as much as I have ripped it on this program for years he has never once said goal mail bombs to my political opponents\nAnd shouting lock her up is not the same thing in the mail her a bomb it may in fact lead people to condemn each other at higher rate we talked about that yesterday but it is not in fact incitement to violence the center for incitement to violence is for nearly Hi Andrew American law as well it should be\nPresident Trump reacted to all of this yesterday and his first statement was we all have to unify you know that you're trying times but we all have to understand that violence is not appropriate\nAnd I just wanted to use it [laughter] these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd it showed one very clear strong unmistakable message today [laughter] or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nOkay well that seems about the right answer doesn't it\nThat's the right answer and what he really should add at the end of that is listen I use charge Frederick my opponents used trucks rhetoric\nMaybe we all should take a step back and tell them that down\nBut the reality is that nobody not me not my political opponents nobody has actually incentivized this kind of violence in the United states nobody in the United states than fighting this kind of violence in mainstream political rhetoric which is true okay to actually wants to the\nMainstream violent being pushed by political agitator all you have to do is look at actual government in Iran where they literally ... death to America and call for violence against Jews all you have to do is look at governments around the world repressive governments around the world and make clear they want and violence done to their political opponents\nEven President Trump were statements where he's making jokes about ... would you talk about last week body Fleming report there was an actual difference it turns out between body slamming reporter and bombing someone now if somebody went out and punch reporter and said I did it because President Trump was making this sort of remark about raging forte make light of that\nI Would say okay there's at least some connection there I'm not going to say that there's a connection between people sending mail bomb Maxine Waters and the president of the United states saying that Maxine Waters is a very low IQ individual we hit a kind of stuff about each other all the time and a free country\nMaybe it's not the best thing to say but that doesn't mean it's an incitement to violence\nIs kind of stuff has to stop it really does but the media are not stopping it\nAnd President Trump fires back in just a second the media obviously are not lowering the temperature is amazing to watch members of the media claim that violent rhetoric began with President Trump or overheated rhetoric non violent rhetoric overheated rhetoric began with President Trump if it weren't for Trump we wouldn't have anything like this really\nRacing racing was sent to Senator Susan Collins two weeks ago a year and a half ago a Bernie Sanders supporter shot or tempted you should thirty six congresspeople and nearly killed the house majority what\nDonald Trump junior is white was sent an actual toxic substance she had to go to the hospital for like two and a half months ago\nNo this is not all Trump no it didn't start with Trump this has been true in the United states for a very long time people use charged political rhetoric that does not mean violence is okay but violence has been commonplace in political circles for literally decades\nIn the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies bombings were actually quite routine in the United states they're not routine thank God now we have an eye out for them as well we should try to pretend that ever in the world begins spending with President Trump is just absurd especially considering some of the rhetoric that has used on a fairly frequent basis by\nFolks on the left about President Trump himself so for example today in the New York times or yesterday in the New York times there's an actual piece in the New York times it is a fiction piece just five novelist imagine from next chapter\nIn his in the New York Times Book review section\nAnd here's what they say they say our focus here at the book reviews on books and stories but also on how the books being written and red reflect the world outside a book and one of the biggest stories out there of course the Miller investigation and the relationship between Trump and food and it's hard enough to speculate about what might happen next that and we thought who better than some of today's most talented spy and crime novel is\nOne of these novelist or person ... isn't the pages of the New York Times Book review that quote\nThe Russian landed in Dallas after forty eight hours traveling of necessity he came from Moscow by a secure this route a long way with very specific task there'll be no return flight and the airport bars the TVs were tuned to different news channels but the story was the same\nFirst the president's campaign manager then his lawyer Republican congressman and former aide family members those words indicted were subpoena house arrest and become fashionable\nAnd then it goes on and on about how this guy was basically shadowing the president of the United states and here's where where it's always sharp gets to the gate\nWhen it was time he went downstairs took his place in the lobby before the entourage appeared the hotel staff have been lined up and see their boss the president go buy a few of them applauded most did not the president didn't seem to notice he weighed in his sultry fashion the secret service agents clustered around him usher him toward the armored limo idling outside of the curb\nThe Russian waited until they were a few steps half before you drew the gun\nYou cited on the center of the president's back and squeeze the trigger\nThe macaroni miss fired the secret service agents at the president shoulder heard the ... financial crouch you registered the scene instantly drawings or weapon with razor edge reflected\nThe Russian tasted failure he closed his eyes and waited to pay the costs that did not come he opened his eyes the secret service agents stood before him presenting his glock but first hear the agents had politely use mine\nAnd this was printed in New York Times the same day that the media decided that President Trump was the one who is pursuing violent rhetoric and was the only one pursuing violent rhetoric\nI'll take a step back here everyone is overheated it needs to stop a few things can be cruel once one wait for all the evidence to don't blame non violent but overheated rhetoric for violent and three if you want to take the temperature down you have to obey wanting to\nIf you want to take the temperature down wait for evidence and don't blame people for violent act by third parties unless they are actively telling the third parties to commit the violent jak\nWhat about our country that's all we're all going to need to do and that means don't come to confirmation bias\nAs soon as humanly possible okay I'm gonna get through the media is response to all of this which is just egregious and then President Trump's response to the media but first let's talk about your underwear guys bowl this year as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade to reach soccer draws on this fall colors in print from Tommy John Tommy John it's just fantastic underwear so good\nMy kids took it out of my door and started wearing it around this morning I Am not kidding five pairs of them one over the other that they're telling me John that even my kids love it Tommy John obsesses over every little detail on that\nUsing proprietary fabrics and perform like nothing you've\nEver warm before as a

other like moisture ... reasonable\nDesigned to move with you not against you know a bunch of you know riding up Tommy John his so confident in their underwear that if you don't love your first here

now and he's probably been for twenty percent off your first order that's ... percent off only at Tommy John dot com again Tommy John ... from a coupon for twenty percent off the media\nHave decided that President Trump is to blame which was predictable Paul Waldman\nIn the Washington Post actually just blame the president of the United states straight out he says allow me to suggest that blame is too narrow way to make sense of a series of attempted bombing aimed at precisely the people from another Republican spend a huge amounts of time ...\nWe don't have to look for clues about whether the person responsible has a ... or what their party registration is we don't have to assign directly and beyond a reasonable doubt well we can say is that even though it from his Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact as wonder it took this long\nSo in other words you don't need to wait for evidence right does a guy who's overtly making the case in one of the nation's premier newspaper you don't need to wait for evidence and if you wait for evidence then you're doing something wrong and said I'm going to jump to the conclusion I Want to jump do which is that President Trump is responsible for ...\nYears a woman says it's not just the Trump advocates violence against his political opponents do he does is it everything about his rhetoric pushes his supporters in that direction even if the overwhelming majority will never quite get to the point where they'll actually commit this kind of act of terrorism\nAnd well there are those of us on the right who felt that President Obama burns pretty easily on promoting violin sometimes when he talked about what the police were when he talked about how the police were\nOvertly and systemically racist when he said that sort of stuff we felt like okay well you know\nMost if not all of those devices are now in Quantico, Virginia the FBI is headquarters or where they will go through everything

is responsible for the state of male bombing attack again without any of that they have no idea who this person is or why they're doing it but what do you need evidence for when you hate the president you know\nWhen when they suggest that President Trump not liking his political opposition is to blame for somebody sending bombs to members of the political opposition all I have said you are trying to outlaw politics in the end what you're trying to outlaw get political opposition\nWhen I spoke at Berkeley there are people outside chanting speeches violence that's basically the chat that's happening on CNN her headquarters here but it's completely hypocritical by the way also because what the what and what the folks at the end and really mean is it speech is only violence is coming from the right\nHere's an example so Don Lemon represented Trump he says President Trump is blaming members of the media anything mean any being cruel at night he's letting members in the media but really the victims and all of that well\nLet's be real they're the victims of the bomber but they're not necessarily the victims of President Trump the media can stand on their own two feet and they're fully capable of fighting back against the president and they have been for the last three years\nHere is Don Lemon saying President Trump blame the victim\nNever ever told me I'm a victim tonight for him to sit there and blame us we're the victims here and only a disgusting\nAnd he just you know what were the victims here were the victims here again CNN or the victims\nBut not present in from not when it comes to that OK President Trump was saying that the overheated rhetoric on the part of the media are contributing to a bad environment the United states and the response of the folks in the media is let's overheat the rhetoric even more\nAnd I'm Sorry but it is this is over done okay they yep Kris ... in a hug each other outside of CNN you know in the middle of a segment\n... them doing this do\nTake a gruesome facts the opportunity to be better if you'd rather have a good show you very much be careful\nYou know all all the folks who are or acting as though there is some sort of existential threat to the media in the United states I'm Sorry no I'm Sorry no there isn't okay this is a bad incident there's no question at the bad incident\nThe reason I have a little bit of lack of sympathy for that we we almost died here regime is because this thing was stopped in the mail room with no detonator on and apparently my Jewish high school used to be evacuated three times a year\nBumper minimum three times a year and you know what it wasn't people hugging and kissing outside because there are crazy people\nOut there there are crazy people out there but the way the CNN is reading that is that it's not crazy people it's perfectly sane people who are being directed by the president of the United states to attack them they're an institution under assault by the presidency was calling for violence on behalf of his of his political friend\nNo no and you don't get to do this I'm Sorry Don Lemon does not get to do this routine when the media are the victims of the same time that he is out there claiming that antifa is wonderful this is just a couple of months ago just a couple of months ago John Lennon claiming that antifa an actual violent terror group and the United states is totally fine\n'em knowing condones violence but there were different reasons for antifa and for these neo Nazis or to either one races ... the other groups fighting racist fashion\nOr they're not that bad I mean they're just fighting racist fascist antifa it's it's just again everyone is garbage okay to memorial today show everyone is garbage going good mad yard and they say ... evidence\nThat the money some of the show run and you're getting Israeli jet rather Raul ... and I just talk about whatever popped in my brain but got lame at me cough and she'll get your own coughing credit I say OK by then I come in without any conflict and the lady that got me said do you go\nTo say there is no connection between what Trump is set about Hillary Clinton Rocco bomber Eric Holder John Brennan and soon and and the thing too you know the person who said those type bombs is full hearty how do you know that you don't know that\nHe doesn't know that because he doesn't know thing everybody assumes the worst on behalf of everybody else and instead of saying there's a difference between he'd political rhetoric and violent political rhetoric we just jump in with both feet the Democrats are even worse than the media and that's because the Democrats are absolutely hypocritical and absurd so Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer put out a statement\nOn this ah on on the attempted bombing and here is what they said this emily's an audio recording over a daily wire\nShe says Senate minority leader Senator Chuck Schumer and house minority leader\nNancy Pelosi lashed out at president Donald Trump in a statement released Wednesday afternoon they're jointly condemned the statement from the president you should earlier in the day expressing his concern over a series of suspected explosive devices sent the prominent Democrats they take we listened with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people\nAnd that is our first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statement that can do an act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed reporter the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville his supporters of rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world's murder of their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people now",
