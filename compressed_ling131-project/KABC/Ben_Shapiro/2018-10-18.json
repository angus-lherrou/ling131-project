{"content": "There trying to stop civil forfeiture the governor keeps defeat doing certain things in the allowing to have this waiver where they can kind of get around it by saying okay well you weren't convicted of anything but now you're agreeing to gift\nState of Wyoming whatever it is we're seizing\nAssist manipulation you know it's just it's theory whether you're doing with the fine print or whatever it's the same thing\nI didn't go to any of the shows [laughter] I was I just lost my life's savings I was completely despondent you know just\nBeside myself I drove away in a state of like not knowing what is it just it happen\nI spent the next few hours probably just\nCollecting myself honestly trying to like figure out what do I do here\nAnd so I stopped at a McDonald's got on the wife I with my laptop and just started to research I didn't even know what civil forfeiture was at this point you know\nNow I learned about it that starts to look for attorneys right off the bat\nAnd so I found the Institute for justice and then all of his name and come up in a few of the the cases and I was already late at night so I could call at that point in the first thing in the morning I called up has to speak to him he answered the phone and I told them what had happened\nAnd he says okay that's very interesting we want to help you if we can\nFrom that point on they didn't formally represent me\nBut they helped me every step of the way and they had the vet me they really had to look deeply into who I was in was my story true and they came out here and checked everything out\nBut they're my phone they went through my wallet they\nWent through everything was very intent\nRight away we started to send\nLetters to the state of Wyoming requesting the money back claiming that it was mind\nAnd the state of Wyoming this kind of drag their feet they weren't going to do anything they weren't going to get anything back\nAnd yet filled didn't have the luxury of dragging his feet with his pending purchase a smart studios and ah\nI contacted the person who I made a contract with\n'cause we were set the clothes and all that everything was going to go\nForward and I and I told them what happened and said okay well why don't I give you a nine month lease\nWe'll see where your court cases at the end of the nine months and that's happening right now we're at that kind of end point we've got some dates that we have to get my bank financing papers to him and stuff but uh so that was that was very cool of him\nAnd they basically said to look at me like the guy or try to help them out here but ultimately you can't put this money together we will you know sell to someone else\nYeah I mean uh that's the reality of of real estate he's got property and needs to sell it I mean one of the unfortunate things is because of this guy I don't think a lot of people knew this place was for sale and now that this is all\nStarting to come out a lot of people do and they're contacting me they're like hey I wanted to buy a place that I wanted to buy it by the place so we'll see what happens\nHere um I could lose it can very easily it's to me it's hanging in the balance\nBut filled to have one arrow in his ...\nWherever that the state of Wyoming\nDidn't know about\nThe had no idea that I had representation at that time\nThey thought that he was just some for Yahoo out there that they could take advantage of\nAnd this wasn't just any old representation at the Institute for justice has forty four attorneys who work\nFull time fighting for the liberties of Americans who don't have the resources\nFight for themselves when they're unjustly targeted by their government [noise]\nThese guys have litigated five cases before the Supreme Court\nWyoming's government didn't know that when they violated the rule of law\nThey had had a hearing in July without letting me know about it and we'd already corresponded about eight times back and forth you know they knew everything they had my addresses they had my phone number of them the emails\nAnd everything and there was no attempt to contact me today this hearing without me decided to take and show up to forfeit my money I Would have been there for sure and so the case was supposedly closed\nThis hearing that we asked for was just to reopen it saying that hey we've been a good contact\nOr you should have been able\nTo notify me so you need to reopen case [noise]\nAnd we got out there and\nIt turned out that the judge was on a leave of absence his wife was ill so there was a retired judge military judge an older guy Seventy seven years old I think\nAnd he showed up there in the in the morning of the court hearing all of a sudden one of the senators Wyoming is trying to call me one of the house of representatives was trying to call me\nAnd the southern Russia adventurous wasn't accidental the Institute for justice worked with a publication\nBox to have a long expos they on this soccer\nCome out the very beginning of the hearing the article I dropped it was like bills oh my God there's reporters there and everything and right before that hearing\nBecause of this article and all this stuff blowing up I Believe the judge told everyone to the side and said hey let's let's just get this done let's now even worry about why the hearing didn't happen in the first place and not you know let us get this done\nWe we want no part of this now and I think the attorney general in Wyoming I Believe he wanted it to this go away\nAnd then talk about three weeks for filled life savings to ride back to just before he and I met and hopefully in time to be able to make smart studios is permanent home [noise]\nHopefully he still is patient you know because I just got the check a few days ago\nThe bank is going to take a little bit to look at things and you know I've had expenses in this last point of time to which I have to have to pay off now so it's still be close [noise]\nBills been busy in watch for now\nHis studio\nWork in a way on his other dreams\nHave been really into electronic music I started\nBurning man I think seven years ago and really getting into some artists out there\nFirst I didn't like it at all is Kelly what is is you know in this guitar school like full blues like the oldest Ross was five and drum tradition which is like the start of blues really than I think after like\nJohn Lee hooker elves twenty thousand times and blood of black Sabbath I just you get tired of that you know and I really started to get into electronic music\nFour years ago I started producing it on my own\nBut I wasn't up to the state I wanted\nFinally this past year I started to produce stuff that I felt like was on a par with\nI felt like okay now I have a voice\nHave voice known\nAs star months or\nEight different voice but this same voice that is grateful to the Institute for justice and especially their donors who could be spending their money on\nFind meals and yachts and instead to freely give of themselves to help hundreds of people like Phil\nIt's just out is\nSued for justice people that wrote me on Facebook to show their support it started to go find\nMe for me like people are often like hailed by and you can pay back like it really restored my faith and you've added\nWhen things like what had happened to me happened\nIt it really makes you question the world you live and and just God you know what am I living in and and this makes me feel horrible\nI Can't believe how many loving supportive people\nThere are out there is really blows me away\nAnd great job on that as always Alex and what a story and what a story about the rule of law\nBy the way we always say we support vast majority of our law enforcement officials who do a fine and an honorable job but we've always got to watch out for government power folks always that's what the constitution was about\nAnd look what happens in a situation like this to leverage that law enforcement has and the way a rule can be used to raise revenue\nAnd this is when we always worry folks when the law enforcement acts like a revenue inch\nOr not it should be about right and wrong and protecting the country and what a job at the Institute for justice does each and every day out there defending an essential right in this country or property rights bill for harm of inches story\nOr rule of law series here\nOn our American story [noise]\nOur American story brought you buy a P. R.\nJ. Los Angeles orange cumulus station [noise] say a B\nC loses live and local at nine o'clock I'm Jeff ... sheriff's deputies circulating photos of an elderly Palmdale couple who went missing yesterday eighty seven year old ... Davis and his Ninety One year old white Pauline where last seen around six last night at their home on stage tree street\nAnd now President Trump is is signaling that\nThe great danger to this is the Federal Reserve the federal is or has been tightening interest rate the reason they're tightening interest rate just because they don't want to bubble they don't want a a a lot of folks taking out cheap credit from the Federal Reserve bank lending out a cheap rates and then all of those that has been overvalued and then the\nTony collapse and you get like a dozen two dozen Seventy thousand age and the Federal Reserve actually isn't doing the worst thing the fact that government ... the fact that the economy continues to grow at extraordinary rate with the Federal Reserve tightening credit is actually quite a good thing but here's President Trump suggesting that the economy might be a little bit more fragile than we think it is by\nGoing after the Federal Reserve\nAnd we read is is it because the fed is raising rates to fish and its independence show I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to fish because you look at the list inflation numbers are very low\nOkay and it's and it's you know debatable is whether the fence or even exist but if the fed is going to exist and raising interest rates in a time of of economic boom is not the world's worst idea\nHowever there is a problem we do have this booming economy like seven million unfilled jobs to amazing statistic for all the talk about the hollowing out of the American middle class and the people who are living in despair in small town communities\nSeven million unfilled jobs is a lot of unfilled jobs as a lot of unfilled jobs and we are a country originally of pioneers an entrepreneur people who are willing to venture out of the spaces from which they were born in order to find new economic opportunities and new jobs\nThe problem is that an economy is booming liked it but then also may require you to add new skills and move out of your home town it's\nDeeply at odds with some of President Trump's campaign promises is deeply at odds with a certain perception of the economy that's pushed by the so called populist right\nNow want to talk about populist right I'm Talking about folks who I think to a lot of truth things in a lot of stuff on a lot of subject but not on this particular subject or they ... and in this in this particular camp I count\nA bunch of folks who have you made big names for themselves\nBased on the idea that America's economy is bound to fail that that there's too much income inequality is from the right people supposedly from the right I mean there's too much income inequality the manufacturing jobs are dying that small towns are dying and therefore the government has to step in and regulate we need terrorists\nYou'd regulations we need redistribution we need heavier unionization\nThis comes from a value system that doesn't actually see the morality and the free markets per se\nNow listen there's nothing that isn't necessarily moral and how people use free markets but the basis of a free market system private property ownership in control of your own labor that is a deep moral good there is something moral about free markets that is not moral about restricted market\nThat can only hold true when there is no exploitation that can only hold true when the government prevents forced use of labor for example\nBut when the government steps in and starts trumping on free market principles on individual property rights an individual use of labor\nThen you get into trouble and the problem is that there is a widespread perception among a lot of people in the populist right that America's economy even when it's going great guns is still unfair this is where the Trump being right needs to Bernie Sanders left\nTucker Carlson has a new book out called ship a fool's we're going to have Tucker on Sunday special sometime in the near future\nAnd soccer is sort of it I can I'm On economic populist very talented guy obviously and Tucker's economic populism\nBorders on sort of a Bernie Sanders perspective on how the economy ought to work he talks a lot in his book about the sort of suffering middle class that was left behind and one of the things he says in the book is that I was reading it last night and it's really well written it's again Tucker's deeply talented guy\nOne of the things that it's edited says that well the rich have gotten richer and the United states the poor and gotten poorer now he acknowledges that the poor getting poorer in the United states is not actually a thing that's happening at the poor and the United states are still extraordinarily rich by any sort of global standard they are richer than they were in Nineteen Seventy nine by any standard they have better stuff\nBut that's not enough because he says that they're still envy between the rich and the poor and as long as that exists the government has to step in to help prevent that envy from overtaking the political system\nThat's a perspective that probably Bernie Sanders supporters hole and you saw some of this during the election cycle when President Trump was trying to appeal to Bernie Sanders supporters with the same sort of language\nThe free markets were flawed that globalization was a bad thing this is the stands and by the way for free market the dirty word that people use instead of free market these days is globalization now they're significant\nProblems with globalization on the local level in certain areas so for example you're getting out competed by a business in China and your business goes out of business that hurts for you by globalization is just another word for free markets because if you were getting out competed by a farm in California and you're in Ohio\nThat wouldn't be globalization that would just be the free market at work their moral question is whether we should be doing free market stuff with dictatorships like China\nBut there was no economic question than it is beneficial economically to consumers in the United states and you producers use influence in the United states to have free trade\nAnd yet by suggesting that capitalism in free markets are not enough just in globalization is a bad thing what we needed economic nationalism more government intervention\nPresident Trump is actually under cutting the cause and his own economy which is not based on anti globalization it's actually based deeply on a global free market end on less regulation\nPresident Trump's economic system is based on less government intervention in the economy but President Trump has been preaching more economic intervention in the economy by suggesting that the economy is leaving people behind well that's a term that that is he talking point that can be used against him it's a talking point that can be used against him an election\nAnd it's also a talking point that it's not particularly conservative which I'm going to explain in just one second but first let's talk about whether you're sleeping at night there was nobody on the planet like he was why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe would sleep bill to sleep with it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers metro body type and sweet preference as to the perfect mattress with your aside sleeper hot Leeper whether you like a pleasure from but the ... there is no more guessing and there's no more confusion just got a huge leap dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes because they will match you to a mattress that will give you the best sleep all your life for couples\nHe looks even split that mattress down the middle providing individual support Nathan Deal preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders\nTo a hundred and twenty five bucks off at ... dot com slash Shapiro this is a luxury mattress any non luxury price that she would sleep dot com slash up here over a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or my wife and I love our he looked sleep mattress we took that two minutes leap was\nWe got her mattress in the mail we unwrap it put it right on the bed because it in place right in front of you it's really cool and it's really comfortable it's so good I got my sister one for her wedding go check it out he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks off okay so\nIt's not just Tucker I Want to pick on Tucker they're they're a bunch of folks again who I really admire intellectually Tucker is one of the\nAnother person who I might as well actually is a guy named Oren Cass lesson book out that I'd recommend it on the show called the once and future worker and in that book or and talked about this kind of new populist economic\nWhat he says is basically capitalism is designed to provide you the cheapest products and the best products\nAt the most available opportunity and there's no question that this is what capitalism is cheap this globalization has issued we live in times with us down any human being from even fifty years ago\nWe live in a time economically where legitimately you can have any product on planet earth delivered to you within days\nMade in ten different countries assemble in a factory overseas shipped directly to your house and we have to leave your house while he was push push a button and these things arrive at a very famous economic essay called I pencil o that help no one on planet earth actually knows how to make a pencil beginning to end\nWhy because there's a graphite factory and there's one factory and then there's a paint factory there is a metal factory there is a rubber factory all of those places have to generate small pieces of the pencil and then it as a symbol and then it's brought to you for pennies that's the magic of capitalism that's the magic of globalization\nFree market that when people say globalization again because people think that globalization means that we're giving up control to people who are outside America\nThey don't understand the globalization really just means free markets we just had free markets folks would be on board uh globalization is an easy way to do it it's kind of a ... left liberal term for free markets has been used just trickle down economics has left liberal term that has been used instead of supply side economics\nOren Cass in his book you talked about capitalism is great at generating all sorts of consumer good what he says is that we may be living in a time very soon where people can't find fulfillment in consumerism and then they\n... first hand just how vulnerable are neighbors jarring and just all the different things that are how much cheaper to have to worry about\nAs a Saturday thirty one of the

that because right now the Saudis are one of our partners in dating off uranium threat in the middle east\nThe fact that the president and the United states is close with the ... though has created a problem for him because the Saudi crown prince is apparently responsible for the murder of ... there's the repetition they put them in\nThe ... all time was considered the new reformer in Saudi Arabia and indeed ... look as though he was a guy who's going to help lead the anti Iranian coalition that continues to be his alley all the talk about the Saudi regime modernizing\nAnd moving toward liberalism like classical liberalism\nAll that was overstated it is what it is an Islamic dictatorship and which people still have their hands chopped off with that is not exactly a modern country but\nWe're all very shocked and appalled as we should be when Saudi operatives decide they're willing to murder a dissident at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul so here's the wall Street Journal with the latest reporting\nDowney operative speech drunk killed and dismembered a dissident Saudi journalist and the president of the kingdom top diplomat and assemble Turkish officials said Tuesday as Washington or ... provide answers President Trump cautioned that Saudi Arabia should be considered innocent until proven guilty\nAnd secretary of state Mike Pompeo on a visit to the kingdom and Saudi leaders and strongly denied involvement or conducting a furious credible investigation but\nTurkey is now suggesting that they have tape of the entire thing happening at least audio tape the entire thing happening which can be very pleasant I mean that that sort of audio\nWhen he is almost as hard to listen to this Lady Gaga recording an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday Mr Trump compared the allegation chatty agent can tell them to start to ... and the accusations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThis is where President Trump gets himself in trouble and this is not particularly smart yeah\nHere and there are several possible responses to the Saudi situation response number one this is really that we should put some sanctions on Saudi Arabia at least temporarily until they provide some sort of answers on all that and until they punish the people responsible and until they reformed their conduct\nThat possibility number one possibility number two as you say yes this is really bad also every country in that region is basically a garbage ... or it's run like a garbage shape and then the countries themselves with the people are I'm sure\nWonderful in many countries but the administrations of turkey Iran\nIraq certainly Syria certainly uh certainly Lebanon Jordan like none of the universe rations are great western democracies and these are all garbage administration\nSo well he could say is yeah this is really bad also for geopolitical realist reasons like Henry Kissinger\nWe still need to work with the Saudis to contain the Iranian and that's a possibility number two and then there's possibility number three which is from telling the Associated Press quote here we go again with you know you're guilty until proven innocent we just went through that with justice cabinet and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned\nSomewhere justice Kavanaugh screams and silence add any as compared to shouting dictators murder people in conflict and liquefy their body\nThat is just it it's like when Trump said during the Kavanaugh hearings that he'd been accused of things to a cabinet just must have been snacking cellphone forehead shown the card style double faced palm it just it it makes\nYou know the ... because the president sees things in black and white terms on every score\nHe says this sort of stuff but equating Brett Kavanaugh where there was no evidence other than the allegation alone against him with the Saudis murdering a human who has disappeared and where there is apparently audio evidence an audio recording shared with both the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nComparing that to Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh I Can't be a happy camper right now come the hell on I mean really\nApparently on the recording a voice can be heard inviting the conflict leaves the room the voice of a man Turkish ... identified as Saudi forensic specialist I'll I'll tell you\nCan be heard recommending other people president listen to music while he does members Mr ... body\nAccording to the according to the tape shocked he was not interrogated instead he was beaten up drug and killed by Saturday operatives would flown in from Riyadh apparently he was dismembered while he was still alive so things went real well over there all of us again is deeply deeply ugly of course\nThat doesn't actually answered the question as to what President Trump should do however\nAnd this is where President Trump best claim is that he's basically just a real is trying to make deal as far as possible and well he appreciates the human rights violations or bad he's not going to stay up nights worrying about the Saudi Government\nCommitting human rights violations that we all know they've been committing for years on it I mean the same Saudi administration\nThat has been quite friendly with radical Muslims for decades on and the vast majority of the of the Saudi height of the nine eleven hijackers were
