here to\nThis is our American story [noise]\n[noise]\n\nOoh\n\n\n[noise] our American story brought to you by NPR\nThe report the news on its face off of me as funny as hell\nSeven Ninety Ninety\nABC [noise]\nLos Angeles orange\nCumulus station\nLocal at nine o'clock I'm Jeff little a man who intentionally rammed\nOf LAPD squad car with his SUV and harbor city four years ago killing officer Roberta San chosen injuring his partner will spend the rest of his life in prison the judge handed down twenty five year old miner ... sudden today\nIf I could I Would sell this podcast for a million dollar for a listener I cannot because the market does not bear that right the same thing is true in your business as well but these basic misunderstandings about the free market leads to the idea that the free market is somehow\nWhen in reality the free market is the most democratic system of property ownership ever devised by humankind and says that you are the owner of your own labor and your own time it does it you are the owner of the product of your own\nYeah but according to Kim Kelly a teen vogue and our great economic\nClear thinking source she says the capitalism places a heavy focus on private property economic growth freedom of choice and limited government intervention all of which is true generally these tend to be toward the right of the political spectrum\nAnd then she says how does capitalism impact people well it depends on whether you're a worker or a boss if you own a company or employer the workers capitalism may make sense but if you are not then it's bad for you\nThat's a bunch of nonsense that capitalism again has raised the globe from abject poverty it's the reason why you have cool stuff today\nSo why do people opposed capitalism well anti capitalist view capitalism it's inhuman anti democratic unsustainable deeply I ... and they must be dismantled they see it as inherently at odds with democracy because of how capitalism bosses hold power over workers in the workplace and the fact that the more capital one a cruise more power they have\nAgain untrue richer people do not have more power over other individual human beings and poor people do because they can't compel you to do anything it's when regulatory capture takes place that they have more power power is not just power is not just being rich power is argue pointing a gun at somebody\nPower does issue from the the Muslim done it does not issues simply by ... by bases of being rich how many times have you has a rich person to ask you to do something just in your life and he said no\nProbably fairly often I'm not even talking about things that are offering to hire you to do if they offer you ... if they offered to pay you something that is not power that is I'm offering you a consensual exchange and you're saying yeah\nIn any case the the enthusiasm for capitalism is falling away because everybody gets to be the product of the capitalist system we all get to live extraordinarily wealthy long healthy wise because of capitalism that gives us the ability of crap all over it\nThe same way that spoiled brat yell at their parents would spoil them we are yelling at the free market that have spoiled us to\nLatest evidence of this is also Pope Francis talking with Michael Moore during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square at the Vatican\nThe current pope is not a friend's capitalism he's a liberation theology is he believes that that progressive economics ought to be wedded to the gospel and therefore he is constantly talked about the shortcomings of free market\nAs though the alternative government controlled distribution of resources is going to be superior even though it has not been and even the social and supposedly socialist countries that folks on the left like to talk about the Nordic countries Norway and Denmark and and all of a Scandinavian countries Sweden\nThose are all capitalist countries with socialist redistribution systems piled on top of them the question for those countries is how long you can keep piling elephants on top of stills and hope that the still continue to support that weight the filter capitalism the elephants are socialism\nIs not that the entire system is socialism\nBut the pope meeting with Michael Moore is pretty indicative of where we are and then we have a much valley who'd proposal from Kamala Harris the senator from California who was just awful I Know she's my senator\nShe is a she is proposing a what they call it Trump sized tax plan of her own the Atlantic doing humans work to try and suggest that a tax plan is basically just redistribution of resources here's the Atlantic reporting on Kamala Harris his new tax plan and this is the way Democrats are going to run here the way the Democrats are going to run\nIs in a way that that undercuts capitalism and this is an example of it scares her proposal according to the Atlantic Paris is offering that kind of fun house mirror and version of the sweeping Republicans hacked initiative\nOne that would instead of flashing rates on high income households in corporations\nPush huge credit out to middle income and poor family the lift the middle class act would provide monthly cash payments up to five hundred dollars to lower income families on top of the tax credits in public benefits they already received\nLast year Congress gave a trillion dollars in tax breaks to corporation Harris told me that money should have gone to American taxpayers we didn't need it instead of handing it over to corporations and the top one percent now the fact is that the people at the bottom of the spectrum\nThe people at the bottom of the spectrum are not actually paying any taxes right now they are receiving net tax benefit okay the people who are paying all of the taxes and I mean literally all of the taxes in the United states on the net taxes in the United states are the wealthy in the United states\nAnd the wealthy in the United states are paying far more than their fair share it\nIs just a why the people at the bottom of the economic spectrum are paying the tax burden in the United states we have the most progressive tax system on planet earth and yet that includes the Scandinavian countries the light at the Scandinavian countries is that they are progressive in their tax structure there or not they heavily tax people at the bottom of the lower end of the economic spectrum as well because you have to pay for stuff\nThe Democrats don't want to pay for stuff and as we will see is began and Kamala Harris as opposed to tax plan\nShe's not talking about paying for stuff instead what she's talking about is essentially forcing Republicans do raise taxes on the wealthy or forcing us to take out inordinate amount and dead there will never happen to be paid for either through inflation\nOr through higher taxes not just some people are rich\nBut on everyone on everyone as well\nAnd we'll talk about all of that in just one second but first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news about online security breach is pretty hard not to worry about

ABC News [noise]\nHi this is Peter children and I got to tell you I've been promoting nature in Chelsea trinity programs on the radio for over a decade they changed my life my wife's life many of our listeners lives they feel better and you could to listen to what Dr ... the ... the director of research at the center for integrative medicine at the University of Maryland School of medicine has to say\nIf you experience cache loading ingestion loose store cost occasion this is not something that you just have to deal with that was actually introduced nature provides for my own personal years I have been suffering from persistent into gesture and nothing I tried it really helps\nUntil I tried nation provide acts actual providers provides Spain relief and greatly improve my quality of life to this day just so they have for countless people across the world I'm a real believer in the power of age will provide acts as a result I recommend that literally everybody you're pro wanted to say they turn on the label you'll never feel nature under six\nOthers promise nature and delivers except no substitute go to ... dot com or the robotic cooler section at whole foods sprouts or your favorite food store\n[laughter]\nBack as the ... the Democrats are now proposing new plan that basically spread the wealth route as President Obama signed a thing in the world around with butter all\nTurned out not everyone is better off when the American people lose their entrepreneurial spirit\nHere's one of the nice things about charity as opposed to the way that it works on the governmental level the government makes it seem as though the government it had to get the money the government has no money of its own government is taking from me and getting to you or taking from you and given to me or take them from the future and getting a task now\nThe government is not a repository of magical money trade there is no money for us but the government present you with the idea that there is so when the government send you a check you don't have to feel guilty about anything it's just receiving free money after all\nHowever when it comes to charity and their folks in my community Jewish community who received charity they feel terrible about it you can see that you can see they feel terrible about it and\nI think that's a good thing\nI think the thing I think you should feel bad about taking charity as long as you because that that's what's going to encourage you to not stay on the door is going to encourage you to get out there and more it's going to encourage you to make a move toward prosperity can pay all those people back if you see the money that you are receiving\nAs a as a step toward getting your feet under you once again and he can pay people back it's much better way of viewing money and money is growing for free and you can just take it no matter at anytime anyplace\n... it's a just a lack of entrepreneurial spirit and and unfortunately I think that that's the way that that we're going in the United states that example number one example number two there's a lot of talk these days\nWhen for him at all I didn't exist as well in places like Norway Norway which is which is prize love by folks on the American left\nAnd they ignore the fact that Norway actually has become a place where the work ethic is starting to collapse the economist wrote in two thousand to a Norwegian ... to ... minutes to get money from any of the state benefit agency\nAnd you see the ... you actually see this happening where people\nBelieve that they're entitled to things that need the very fact that we call these benefits entitlement as opposed to benefit to suggest them and that that that's point number one point number two\n... of picking up and moving we are the most mobile society in the history of mankind and easier to get from one place to another on planet earth faster than anytime in the history of humankind when we talk about our ancestors in the United states were thing that people and covered wagon taking six months to cross the country you can do it in six hours now on a plane\nAnd for significantly less cost\nAnd yet we are now less mobile right ... fewer Americans\nAre actually leaving their home town I mean the wishes\nNot a good thing we actually want people to go out there\nAnd seek adventure right now Americans are are moving less often than they were right there's an article from the New York times\nThe typical adult was Eighteen miles from his or her mother according to an upside analysis of data from a comprehensive survey of older Americans over the last few decades Americans have become less mobile most adults do not venture far from their home town\nWell part of that is because of family I live very close to my parents but if I were to move my parents would probably follow may not the other way around\nIf you if I Want to live close to my family you know you have to follow prosperity you'd have to follow adventure you have to follow the call you have to move but Americans don't feel that way anymore Americans feel like they're entitled to a job in their hometown where they grow up at the factory where their parents were\nThat is not\nThe way the human beings have worked for literally all of human ... for literally all human history and yet now we believe that in order to facilitate people being able to stay where they were originally base we have to shift the way that the free market works\nWell that's not that's not correct\nAnd again this is not coming out of the places of lack of sympathy this is coming from a place where\nI sympathize with people's plight and the question is what can you do to make your life better Democrats built on the left they went to talk about what can we do to make your life better\nAnd the answer is very little the real question is what can you do to make your life better because every successful Pete person on planet earth is a person who at some point said to themselves what can I Do to help myself\nAmerica is a country of people saying to themselves what can I Do to help my lot in life what can I Do to be more ambitious what can I Do to stretch my wings and fly\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way what can we do to remove the barriers\nThat's the American way is not the American way say listen you\nKnow ... it's uncomfortable to stretch your wings it may be difficult to leave home it may be hard to do this\nBut it so so we're just going to make sure you know you never have to\nWe're going to Cato you we're going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits\nWe're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can't innovate your country on the basis of empathy alone\nAnd that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation and something much more cynical the purposeful innovation of an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "station": "KABC",
