{"content": "You preach your funeral while you're living well said now here's Dr Jeff ... who followed pastor chip in this service\nIf you're like me you may have thought that this is Dave would never come borough venture\nEarl cheated death so many times\nThat we thought he was going to outlive us all and I literally thought he'd cheated death one more time this past Monday morning a week ago today I got a text message from Pam and she said hey dad is declining\nRapidly we would love for you to come over and and pray mom would love for you to come over and pray over him\nAnd so I went over there and we got together and sure enough he was unresponsive\nAnd I literally saw that at any minute they were going to tell me he's gone till the next morning\nAnd so then I I get right outside their house and I finally get attacks from Pam and she says daddy's sitting up in the bed and breakfast [noise]\nAnd so I said what would it be okay for me to come in and visit with him and she said absolutely please come and so I went in the house and they took me back to the bedroom and there he was sitting up in the bed finishing a McDonald's biscuit that somebody brought to it\nAnd then after he finished those basket say said where's my donor\nAnd he shared a donor and a cup of coffee with me one of the first things he said to me was Jeff I Need you to do me a favor I Need you to tell Larry stay ... that I'm probably not going to be at my post Sunday Morning [noise]\nAnd I said Mr Earl I'm not going to tell area thing [noise]\nBecause what I saw yesterday at what I see the day you're liable to be there on Sunday Morning\nWell he had the last word on that\nAnd he was right let me ask you how many people do you know are getting approved for serving with children when they are eighty three years old\nOr oh did two thousand fourteen just three years ago at eighty three he signed up to serve in our children's ministry sports cap\nAnd then in April of of this year at eighty six years of age Earl venture responded to the call of our church to make room in his heart\nFor more people\nAnd he did so by signing up eighty six years old by signing on to serve on our greeter team and less than two weeks before he died he was at his post in a scooter\nAt the equipping hall entrance making people feel welcome does a campaign for warship\nPearls harder service well marked his entire life\nBut folks this is not just something that Earl had learned to do in his old age\nAs a younger man when finally was located old spillway road is pastor said many times he would take his lawn more up to the church and for years he mow the grass at the church he was known by other children there is the candy man\nIf they knew that he had some sweet treats in his pocket and whenever they came to church he would always bless them with some candy\nAnd I've thought a lot about the way that oral venture sir\nAnd it occurred to me that there were two qualities of his life and they're going to have to be two qualities of any person's life is going to be devoted to serving others quality number one\nIs he a surrender his surrender I remember the story\nOf when king David was about to die and he was about the hand\nThe kingdom over to his son Solomon the last war some of the last instructions that David gave to Solomon and first chronicles chapter twenty eight or nine words is asked for you my son Solomon no the God of your father\nAnd serve him with a whole heart and wailing mind\nTo serve God with a whole heart into willing mind implies that you've already surrender\nTo God to lead him lead your life and so I asked are all on Tuesday Morning\nOr when did you open your heart to Jesus when did you surrender your life to Jesus Christ that are all shared with me it happened when he was about junior high school age\nAnd he told me that he attorney for missing and he had trusted crisis is saving it surrenders is life in ... I was about Seventy three years ago\nWhen Earl committed his life to Jesus Christ and so if you do anything for Seventy three years chances are you're going to get pretty good at it\nShifts shares the second quality Earl head that helped him serving others\nBut there was a second quality needed if you're going to serve others and that is\nSelflessness of selflessness about youth serving others doesn't always happen\nWhen it's convenient for you\nServing others doesn't always fit in with your time schedule or when you think it ought to take place\nFirst Peter for ten reminds us to use whatever gift we have received to serve others\nWhatever give the Holy Spirit has given us where do you use that gift to employ it in service to other people and to do this requires an attitude that says put others first\nKaren shared with may just the other day that she could never remember a single\nTime in her life when she needed her daddy and she let him know and he wasn't on his way to help her he was always\nMaking sure that he did everything he could to serve and to bless his family he was a hard worker Jordan is oldest granddaughter shared this she said in her twenty nine years her granddaddy showed up at every recital\nEvery ball game or anything his grandkids were involved in and then it didn't stop with that generation his great grandkids can say the same thing of him just about a week before he died when he was so sick or I was sitting at the ballpark\nCheering his Joshua on in his baseball game selflessness you finished off\nOf what Earl would've desired for those and his service\nIn a very real sense Pearl\nDidn't want this to happen\nThey said just let you and say you come and pick up my body and let that be done\nHe didn't want to have this gathering and I told the family this isn't for him this is for you\nBut I Believe that if some way or old could speak to us right now\nHe would say this do make a fuss about me\nTell everyone about my Jesus he's the one\nWho made my life\nWorth living just say are all knew the joy\nOf a personal relationship with Jesus Christ\nAnd that would be ... desire for you today [noise] so I close and as I close\nI'd like to read the scripture the family chose for today they sent this to me in attacks on friday\nSecond Corinthians chapter for the two versus if they chose on the screen versus seven but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from God and not from a ...\nEverything that are old did every way that he ever serve every gift he ever gave every project he ever tackled\nIt was the power of God working through in\nIn there you have a ... a girl singer ... ... is the guy next door\nBut not really much surrender and selflessness [noise] hard work and always showing up [noise] always being there for the kids and the grandkids and the great grandkids this is our American stories ... ...\n... ... ... [noise] um\n[noise] our American stories brought to you by NPR\nLos Angeles orange\nCumulus station\n'kay\nABC News is live and local at nine o'clock I'm Jeff ... corners and sheriff's investigators located the remains of three people today on a property and juniper hills near Palmdale\nAnd we're going to talk about things that disgrace the oval office\nLike cigars have had human bodily fluids on them that didn't come from the oral cavity in the oval office like they had the steam clean all the carpet after Bill Clinton left\n... and ... there's there's a book bully describing around the manual robbing the M. F. bombed repeatedly in the oval office do no general cost that much of a cost of getting all hot and\nPerls it's just it's amazing it's just amazing so\nJim Acosta anyway to Kenya says all of that and then kind of goes on and he said you know what I Love my nag a hat now we know he lost his ... because he said just before he was on nothing else and he said my ... it's just the best thing ever which I got a ... it's pretty fantastic honey ... it\nIs because just the the juxtaposition of cognac who is I have been told by the you one of the cooler people in America where in the ... and let's be straight about ... just as a general rule just aesthetically there is something that my family war at like the Shapiro family picnics in Nineteen Ninety text\nYou got from like the mass production store that had like you remember they had like little woven band that goes just above the brim of the gap so Tanya wearing that as sort of a an ironic\nFeel it's just spectacular so here's county talking about why maggots are awesome and you've got to appreciate it man you just\n... ... you can do one or two things you need to cry the tragedy that this is what our national politics has become we can laugh at the fact that Donald Trump is now swiveling every pop culture mean the what ever created back on them and slapping them in the basement which is just hilarious\nIt was something about my hat off and make you feel like Superman made\nThat was the favorite for you and your middle supermax\nFor me also as it got it looks so if you look for in reference to American industry guy not knowing what's going to be on it however you want to do if I say it's the way and just go to John\nYeah he's the first of all them a couple of things that cliff once Superman ... favorite superhero which is good I mean that you could pick\nI'd looked at me and myself but companies got his own man and then we also learned that the ... is like a Superman cake which is just spectacular you could see the media members in the room collapsing in on themselves like dying stars it's\nJust great and then ... does the worst thing in the world he gets up and he says about President Trump I Love this guy that was hilarious and that this is that until Donald Trump ran for president this was the view of Hollywood Donald Trump was very popular with all of these people in the media is very popular\nHe was very popular in Hollywood like he'd go around and how people will be back slapping him giving him a hug she was doing cameos on every show\nSo it's it's kinda funny now that oh my God can you give them up everybody loved Donald Trump until I ran for president twenty sixteen which way everybody hated Donald from like it was ... breaking the ultimate taboo and making physical contact in the flesh with Donald J Trump\nFine love this guy here let me just gotta [laughter]\nI Love this guy right\nThere is there's a Carl Weathers Arnold Schwarzenegger hand grip\nJust amazing stuff and then kind of actually had some pretty good political comments that will do the good and then we'll get to you know that we're so he is a good political comments about racism what he said is basically you can't use racism as an excuse for failing in America anymore instead maybe we ought to think about how we actually better the country\nSeems pretty fair to me and this is coming from a guy who as I understand that grow up with a single mom in impoverished area and then made himself a billionaire so even though I don't like rap and I'm not a fan of Conyers' music histories pretty American story it's pretty amazing American story there's plenty of talking about racism\n[noise] a lot of times it's just an overall lack of reparations that we can be given point we say\nThis is this is this is this is racist would try to control a person to the concept of racism because we know that we're very proud emotional people do and I feel like try to make someone is liberal they'll say\nOh what do you think racism ...\nInvisible whoa\nYes yes [noise] [noise] [noise] flow Clapper kind of and this is the point the point that he's actually making here does not require you to be all that learned in politics\nAnd when he says that racism is very often used by political actors in order to achieve a particular result in order to manipulate people that is certainly true that is certainly true so well done county there and then ... made everyone had explode when he defended the second amendment which is just bad actors county doing that\nWill debate about the second amendment going on for problem was legal or illegal guns is a problem not not not legal ... we have the right to bear arms\nOh no all of their heads just exploded Kanye eight actually saying the truth constitutionally about the second amendment now listen\nAs I said before any time you get in bed with celebrity you should expect that somebody's gonna get screwed and the fact is that\nSomething could happen with Kanye as a personality that could be damaging\nTo all of the points that he's making here but take it and the ... from what it is today he's staying some things that need to be said and when you hear an argument you really instead of first considering the source may first one to consider the validity of the argument the argument that Conyers making their is exactly right now as I say live by the county die by the ... when the second how the die by the Kanye half of this war\nAnd then we'll get to the media coverage which is a real story the media coverage of this meeting is a much bigger story than ... actually visiting the White House you've been to the White House before I Believe I mean he he was there when Obama was president naturally so\nIt's not a giant truck but we'll talk\nIn a second about the media coverage but first let's talk about your bathroom habits how are you getting ready to go out showering to wash the workday are filing your hair brushing your teeth you know being a human and asking because as a proud member of dollar shave club I'm here to tell you no matter what you do to get ready dollar shave club has everything you need to look feel and smell your bad\nTaste in your

refreshed in England clean\nAnd laughing surprisingly long time and their hydrate and body cleanser as well it washes away the workday it's the best part of showering it smells awesome and my skin is soft and ... I Hope that showering and brushing your teeth are part of how you get ready to go out 'cause otherwise you're gross but\nNo matter what you do to get ready yes he has everything unique I haven't even talked about their razors they're shaved butter everybody knows dollar shave club for those products right now at a dollar shave club start are set for just five bucks each they've got a shower sat\nShe's making toothbrush that or they're in the shade butter and raise or any one of those that's just five bucks it's the best way to try out they're amazing product after that\nYour product ship at regular priced at your ... dollar shave club dot com slash then that dollar shave club dot com slash then\nOkay so as I say there's good Tony and then they're back on you so it's great when people make good arguments it's not as good when they juxtapose them with crazy talk show I Do have to point out the economy did engage in some their economy of behavior honey took out his phone and he proceeded to punch in his code which as it turns out these euro zero zero zero\nUm and then it was funny people were getting uptight about this because there's a how can you reveal Congress coat on his own you don't ... don't you don't do that at the map [laughter]\nUnless he loses phone is not going to matter at all but I Will say that cutting any better protection on his ... Mr west I I Would appreciate it if you use some other number other than zero zero zero and then it gets you type in zero zero zero zero and then he proceeds to show the president of the United states a picture of a hydrogen powered airplanes\nAnd this is a thing that happened because the I don't know I don't know man we'll hit her head and on the toilet and now he's been to the flux capacitor or something they air the air is Conyers showing showing President Trump the hydrogen powered airplanes\nSays right here\nI mean one of\nAirplanes and this is our president ... look at this year\nGet rid of it\nI'm like\nWell we're going to have a whole American companies were one was funny was [laughter] he has to be on the fly explains the factory\nOkay so it all comes the package man there is no separating out the same guy who stands and good about politics has also talking about hydrogen powered by plane so that as being out ... I I Will say just as as an observer it was really funny to watch President Trump during the meeting because President Trump is rarely blown out of her room by somebody else is\nSort of wacky innocent charisma usually Trump blue and somebody else out of the room with that sort of stuff\nHim sitting across from ... and looking at the look on President Trump said it's kind of like the look that Jeb Bush has on his face when he's in a room with President Trump is like an Trump suddenly realize what it was like to be Jeb Bush and watch this guy the much bigger celebrity\nAbout Fifteen hundred students and teachers in the Beverly Hills Unified School district or bus home in the neighborhood protesting Macron's jak just student hope he's listening\nTo leave the metros expansion benefit millions of people but they said is the number one fire to protest\nIs said to be a last ditch effort to put an end to the road from downtown to Westwood and that would run underneath Beverly Hills high school and metro spokesman says the project underway when a five year environmental review before being approved in twenty twelve James Rojas can be seen in\nThe Santa Monica Malibu Unified School district has resigned a teacher who said one of President Trump's senior adviser Stephen Miller would eat blew off his arm when he was in her third grade classroom\nThat teacher Nikki Fisk also told the Hollywood Reporter quote he had such strange personal habits he was a loner an isolated in off by himself all the time and quote\nThe death toll from hurricane Michael has risen to Seventeen but it's expected decline even higher eight of the deaths so far reported in Florida\nA Turkish newspaper is reporting that missing Saudi journalist ... may have recorded audio of his own murder on his apple watch the papers has to show you started the ... hit the record function on his watch before entering\nThe Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and the audio of his interrogation torture and killing were sent to his cell phone in the eye cloud\nBut Saudi Arabia denies killing him a DNA match trauma discarded strawberries them led to the arrest of a twenty three year old Los Angeles man suspected of breaking into a catering ban and the home in Glendale\nRubio police revealed friday the ban was burglars me first on the emerald Ireland the brine bid was determined the burden or stolen fresh robberies from the catering truck\nOfficers check community found distorted shrubbery stems which were sent to a crime lab for DNA matching the storms were matched to suspect Michael Ramirez ... whose DNA had been collected in two thousand to Seventeen in connection with another crime Rob ... have you seen huge talk radio seven Ninety K.
