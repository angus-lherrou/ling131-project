college\nBut within that college there's moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule AJ\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connect all of everything that we have begins to lose its water separates out and then we begin to lose that the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together and of course

too if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nNow this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today one molecule are we talking about how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features an exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used pre teen right but for those that don't know about Korea peanuts mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's we're creating those rush\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as\nWe get older we know that's a big part of age are not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know that\nIt's an amazing stories can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single celled tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain\nStrength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf kind of anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we were all the stuff that was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies meet a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea peanut in our muscles you know the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nHe goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the creeping in your muscle tissue and you get stronger\nYou get more powerful not only that it helps or memory and brain health and help support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years and when they strengthen performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that how you've used it\nKnow about it athletes know about it Korea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course he knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen Ninety eight the international Olympic Committee\nThat came out the officially confirmed and I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever a strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have a large amounts of red meat like\nFour pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian so they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on every strong he noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on a younger person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan style or if this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing that folks in the fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea Team can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle and Hansing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus there is like you and me patent but let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals okay\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American University is a group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works for one week study get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that they could generate more power on a stationary bike pack this happened in one week when I think about that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAll right but what about the women out there did they get those kind of benefits to as well but would actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies stronger to\nArabs or Lou ... let's go straight to another study love the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women published in the European Journal of applied physiology\nThirty women age fifty to Seventy one the course they are creating a
