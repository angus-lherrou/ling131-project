GBH in Boston best started following the secret crisis when it started two years ago\nAnd after Hurricane Maria she began investigating what happened to all those ... cases here's ...\nIf you're covering as they get crisis in Puerto Rico one of the first people you have to me is Dr Carmen Syria she asked me to counter Carmen I first interviewed her back in two thousand sixteen when does he get epidemic was exploding she's an OBGYN university hospital in the capital of Santa one\nMm [noise]\nI've wanted to understand the politics behind Zeke up ever since I started following it two years ago and I did everything I could think of to talk to someone from the health department at first I called [noise]\nAnything [noise] Spanish I mean\nWhen I was at work I showed up at their offices again and again\nI mean the problem is I mean I've been to this office many times now in person and also calls and he was so they\nFinally I tracked down the assistant secretary of health Dr Concepcion can notice long ago we meet in the hallway of the convention center where she is speaking at a press conference about a new lunch program and just like the doctor said she's quick to give me the government's official line ... that the crisis\nOver so far\nOur state epidemiology they'll son expect to have cases right now\nI asked her why the health department had stopped testing pregnant women physique uh this is what every doctor I spoke to told me she says that's not true that the health department is performing the tests and has been since just a few weeks after the hurricane\n... we tried to make sure ah samples collected all over the line where ... percent but I Love what I thought he in the department of health on one with the people\nOn this uh samples where sent a to the CDC love what I thought he seen the states because our lab would have thought ... was damaged\nI checked with the CDC and they told me that never happened the health department and never since ... samples to Atlanta for analysis but doctor can notice is adamant that the testing is back on\nWhere I'm not saying that they try and get on the ... the female\nWill follow up on a couple of things um first of the testing of pregnant women the OBGYNs that I was talking with\nThey didn't seem to think they had a clear mandate from the health department she'll be testing or that there was a way to get those test results back then Monday\nExcess she blames the doctors for dropping the ball\nThey're cited suspicious in rabbit or his his um we don't have that close contact with them to make sure they do did they think they should um\nDon't you know and it's also tells me that women can I ask to be tested but I find out later that testing is no longer free women now have to pay one hundred dollars and the other thing is last year the government said the crisis was over so why would a woman even ask for the test na\nNa na na for something else when we'll all that data on developmental delays and seek a baby's be released\nI think uh there will be some information released\nThis is the kind of answer I get from doctor to known as an almost everything we talk about she's hard to pin down and by the end of the conversation she tells me that she needs to get permission from her boss the health secretary before she can share any more details\nNot that I can talk to anybody openly without being authorized because we want to have a be correct\nAnd left standing in the convention center hallway and starts to become clear to me is that the health department doesn't want to talk about the ... with me or even their own top secret doctors several doctors told me they stopped hearing from the health department altogether\n\n\nIn that silence doctors like Carmen ... and Cynthia Garcia started wondering why why was it so important for the government to make it go away Cynthia says they think it comes down to money\nThere is no question you know that the ... that make the notion of having ... and my hair effect that all of us in terms of tourism\nTourism it's the life blood on the island I reach out to the Puerto Rico tourism association and talked to the organizations president and CEO Clarissa Jimenez about how much ... affected the island\nIt was a huge in fact\n... remembers when the CDC first issued warnings about the ... in Puerto Rico in two thousand sixteen\nThe numbers they weren't even were really really high and scary I we had lots of cancellations you know there was a\nThe perception that you would do that here and you would get the virus I mean because that was what was portrayed you know those huge percentages of the population and getting the virus\nTourists stayed away and the island lost one hundred million dollars and that she says shouldn't have happened\nOh let me see however and I say so their realities that a lot of hype was created\nAfter Hurricane Maria the government wanted to build back the tourism economy as quickly as possible and doctors I talked with believed that meant getting rid of the ...\n...\nNo ... is still a brand and so she's found a way to restart testing of pregnant women for ...\nAnd I feel this is so important to be able to identify because most of their patients who have seek out do not have any symptoms ... and they ... they might be at risk for these things\nAre Carmen did an end run around Puerto Rico's health department and she teamed up with the CDC to provide free testing for pregnant women it's the only program like it on the island so\nThat we're starting to think ... and you have written\nThe first day back in the spring eight women\nWell stay with the that it did you know when the hurricane started that you are right now I found out like we were struggling with this why now but don't call it may be Mary I'm not calling his name [laughter]\nThat that I think that name Lindsay eliminated from their birthright history the now while here [laughter]\nThe new testing continued through the summer and it's still going today doctors say the first results are in and even though it's a small sample there alarming nine percent of women are testing positive and that's almost what the rate was at the height of the epidemic\nOn his time the sound of a researcher I'm not running for anybody because we'll see Sean therefore I kind of an eye on if you see what the evidence desk me to sing\nAnd the evidence is telling Carmen ... is a very real danger today for pregnant women and babies in Puerto Rico around twenty six thousand women will give birth this year so far fewer than three hundred have been tested for ...\nI'd be no situation for when I'm thirty six years and I've been blessed are being\n... for the birth of so many babies and I got to tell you that the first thing I Will might ask my baby I think he's a ... ... says said we need to do it and we need to the right thing\nAnd and\nThat story was from best Murphy of the ground truth project she's the director of films there and also has a short film coming out about this story\nAnd we check with the CDC about seeking Puerto Rico one of the epidemiology told us that the risk of\nGetting ... now is less than during the outbreak a couple of years ago but the virus will always be there people need to protect themselves from mosquitoes and sexual transmission to avoid getting infected and ...\n... ... ... ... in a moment we had back to the mainland Houston, Texas where a year after Hurricane Harvey ... people who are using a government program to pay for housing or getting the door shut in their faces and you're listening to reveal from the center for investigative reporting NPR eggs\nTo\nMm\nDo you all snap judgment proved for hours the scariest storytelling you're ever going

H M Birmingham public radio for the heart of Alabama\nA public service of UAB supported by our members\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nFrom the center for investigative reporting NPR eggs this is revealed I'm Alison [noise] much like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico Houston has also faded from the headlines [noise]\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after Pam and the kids move than she bought her own house\n[noise]\nThis is why Pam does this work today and why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise is from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further\nThey banned any other city in Texas from doing the same thing [noise] basically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nTexas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year\nThat needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter the she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take altered so she got that what she she gets back to a certain extent\nBut I don't know how to understand\nThe [noise]\nThe discrimination or part of it [noise]\nI don't want her to feel stereotype\nBecause of a voucher\nDenise was really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes both majority white very low poverty better schools [noise]\nPut out of the Seventeen thousand families that get vouchers from the Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those opposed so what's going on here why are so many landlords unwilling to take vouchers in Texas\nAre those who will be ... learned as a discriminatory too\nThis is Stacey on he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that lets landlords they notice acts\nPatient in disguise my colleague Edgar Walters interviewed Stacey Hi earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits have alleging that discrimination against voucher holders what do you say to that\nThat disagree with that I think that the the voucher users in many situations you know they choose to live where their support group for their families were transportation where the job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey ... about Denise\nShe just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe book is reflective of because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\n... through for this lady or with a rose or to the cold to people in this course\nNest quest we'd heard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad using officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and wanted to see if ness quest could really help people liked any so I'll let him take it from here\nHere's how ness quest works they find landlords in areas with high rated schools who don't take vouchers then they make a pitch let this family with a voucher live here and we'll deal with the government for you\nOn time rental payments those are automatic we also secure all these ... for the ... not have to do anything this Isabel Lopez executive director of nest quest off the guarantee that the client will maintain runners insurance in the unit [noise]\nUm and then upon move out we are willing to foot the bill for any damages\nWhen Isabelle took this job that's quest title one point two million dollar grant to spend the goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nWas extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no today and the first time we actually had his heart talking to landlords it was honestly it was really discouraging does affect\nWell so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's but there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee\nThat everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it's still that hesitation that I don't want or what someone who was on section eight\nAs of mid October only Seventeen families with vouchers are renting places ... help\nFive of them are staying in properties managed by the company Stacey hunt works for that sort of thirty eight thousand units his company managers in the Houston area\nFive out of thirty eight thousand I talk to you about this you know it seems like cold comfort to somebody like Denise\nWhere it's the new ... room one bill to the reason we're we're ... the industry is trying to\nReach\nIn July three months after we first met Denise she was still looking for a place in her voucher was about to expire the deadline came and went but I couldn't get in touch with her ... told me Denise was really stressed out\nAnd needed some space than a few weeks later I got a Facebook invite from Pam she's holding this women's empowerment conference around the anniversary of the hurricane it's called I Survived it and Denise is going to be there so in early September I drive down to Houston to this little church not far from his office [noise]\nHow do you

for brunch I finally get a chance to ask her if she found an apartment she says yes\nAnd how do you like it just the way that it\nIs to sell some of my head right now I won't complain a diplomatic way of putting it [laughter]\nI won't complain it's mind\nDenise was not able to find the diverse mixed income neighborhood she was looking for when she left Chicago more than twenty percent of her new neighbors live below the poverty line and almost all of them are black or Hispanic and as for the apartments\nThey really almost look like the project from Scotland because it ain't nothing but a group of people I think on a fixed income and hauled in one area and getting in\nThe high school her daughter goes to now got to be reading this year last year it got an F.\nI Will leave in Texas no but am I going to be a net school zone probably not\nI don't believe so because you're aiming higher most definitely I'm aim and within the next year you'd probably be ... home opening because that's my next go to be a home owner [noise]\nPam told me in spite of it all she's still seems to me as a success story a year after Hurricane Harvey ... she's got a roof over her head she recently got a
