on criminal justice in world see the infamous force extremely high rate of incarceration ... guess unproven have hey how are my friends so where are we starting\nWell I like to dance so let's start at this club near my house it's called the prime example [noise]\nThat's Conrad Albert singing she's the DJ but he is also getting down swings hips clapping he's wearing a flat tangled type kept the kind old men where Conrad sixty sex but he hopped up on his chair to cure over the ... and see how people are dead music\n[noise]\nConrad works as a security guard as well as a DJ he used to be in the navy and then the merchant Marines he has a son named print\nTo learn\nHow to address [noise]\n\nHis tone really changes when he's talking about his son\nYeah his son Prince Albert has been locked up for seven years what's it like for your family to have him be a way for so long\nAs it was very very near you know [noise]\nJust Raj abusing your news [noise]\nHard to explain when\nPart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law\nIt's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flood of sodas and the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon can is arrow uses the law to hammer them\nTo date Bernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws in the U.S and in New Orleans that can put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars Coby Bryan\nMonitored or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone went to that again yeah\nPrinces in a jail that's over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and nice and spends his days along with over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out [laughter]\n\n... my hair down did you say [laughter]\n\nYou said he's looked at it because of the habitual offender statue explain that well\nWas arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nWell in regular here's a seven years but in ... and feels like an attorney\nThompson worked for Ken is arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard that was ... her job offers relied or a better way of describing here that was the way it was\nSo basically any time that you could use that that's often or statute it was the policy of such as office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or a hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like do you tend to zero never puts this tool away\nThe more before we lock up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem punished fun as fun as far as ... you know harsh sentences or the\nTurns New Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there a ... office still uses the habitual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the the first thing you're looking at the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your choir started very where you talked to the prosecutor and to the judge to even the considerations with the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments\nOf your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge or leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nWas this little light black or right this is a light laugh because a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of this law\nTakes away poses a problem with the functions of a judge\nWhich is to fashion the census that's appropriate to simply for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use that had the chill offender statute judges no longer decide how long a person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has no choice\nIf I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I Want that treatments aspect to conform to be part of the sentence with the ... as soon as the one of the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes say twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just to go away in ... [noise]\nAlso went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da Da Nang minutes away just up the Mississippi River the populations as east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just likely on Ken is arrow\nOr I attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports against Ghana there it was private Catholic highschool both are white men both have been da ...\nYou know for me I was with him as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa ... saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything or there's public safety can you surf certainly with no German jail or does public safety really demand ...\nIn the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what ... does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Kennedy era has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times ...\nI shared this number with the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nI never heard back and an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims of\nThe reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already\n\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nRemiss if I had what I consider to be prosecuted case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that's really mess up my call desperate you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nAs if it is a law I think I ever responsibility to prosecuted if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n[noise]\n... is I'm just doing my job was he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from\nA very squeaky chair can explain why my name is Kenneth Jones than I Am what I call a criminal law specialist and I heard that really you go by ... may be a Jew or big you would\nDo a ... a ... you know this is my little ... among war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stuck by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry ...\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait wait a minute here the the just say Harry comic the jazz singer\nNo that's the junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nWhen Harry counting came into office he use multiple below two shores toughness their shows is that ... that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of their lives\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney already comic wonders to use the powers of hers offer to help ... to your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their own inhibited crimes I give you some sort of [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played all that fear so he brought this law back from when ... when does it start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nAny person shot a third ... be convicted\nA labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that have been ... really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to smash shunning the conflict as a scary African American man\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated an a penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for forced labor forced labor wow\nYeah and this leads us right back to the ag before he became an expert on the law he fought in the Vietnam War where he also picked up a drug habit and when he returned home to Louisiana biggie killed a man in a botched robbery something he attributes to his addiction and untreated post traumatic stress\nAnd remember in these cases the da and ever officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking\nAbout here right we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [noise]\n\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story which is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case\nHere a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a plea\nAgreement and received a legal sense under Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy era said my hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate\nHis substance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview ... he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat addiction our connection was in great\n[noise] when did you do the first one\nSo that was like six years into your son\n[laughter]\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nA hundred and twenty people doing nothing in seven years he's got three to go has anything changed for you\nA lot of strange but a lot of work is being away from those of you could move retrieved where you want to move a little ...\nWhere ... LA too many ... ... ...\nA few times now prince has asked me to give a message to his oldest son prince junior these calls are expensive and his son can't always afford them anyway prince asks me to tell a son he misses him and then he says tell them I Love him and I do [noise]\n\nSix ...
