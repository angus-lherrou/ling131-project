like a yes vote you that that's telling them that you don't care one way or the other but as a responsible citizen and a person in the state of Georgia you need to vote\nYou really do you need to teach your children the importance of voting you go out and you beat the bushes and you complain which you don't\nVote\nThan one hundred million Americans of voting age didn't go to the polls in

comes to the purges Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there's this solution\nLet people register all the way to election day at least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia\nBrian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans in states where you have same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robinson is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a writer and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and while the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate a bit uh ... how does it distorted the electorate\nBut if you don't know on October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election and uh the first two weeks of November you're not uninformed

out I don't know what is going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's a fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the falling

machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not highly complex computers paper [noise]\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia a lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hack in Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country\nBut are the people in charge of elections there actually listen\nReveals by Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nYeah yeah so ah right now I'm In the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out the touch screen voting machines she has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places\nThe machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots that I\nWas actually touch ... glitter and then it's deacon pressing the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that will chime at the beginning and you go to Iran came\nTo this is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and others\nIt's basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the continued use of paperless voting machines in this country\nThreatens our national security and the department is now prepared to recommend paper ballots\nAre still Yes sir if there is no way to audit the election that is absolutely a national security concern why didn't look satisfied and you now told us that the status quo is a national security threat\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads so\nReally you're injecting prevention or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of the tree the way it's set up is that that virus could get transmitted every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia's system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wine for the midterm elections\nJudging Amy Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to a paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system\nBy the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that hacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will failed to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security\nThe vulnerable system the machines but very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does to people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight to ...\nAnd it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after ... ... email that\nWe know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\n\nReveals by those you've brought us that story\n\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp established a commission that will look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty\nOh and the other four states heading into the midterms that used to touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New
