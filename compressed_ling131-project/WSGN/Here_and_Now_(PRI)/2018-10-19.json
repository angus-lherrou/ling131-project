Fifteen Saudi security agents some of whom are pictured all over the world traveling with the crown prince\n... the the level of granular evil makes it puts him in a in a terrible position if he wants to not do these sanctions because it looks like he's\nHe's involved in a murder conspiracy to cover up the responsibility of the Saudis I don't think that politically that's a place where he can be no matter how much he loves the Saudis you think that pressure might be enough I've seen it it's it's overwhelming for him and and it gets worse for him because\nAt any point if he tries to justify not doing things by by sort of latching on to some of their own uh theories\nHeat and looks like he's part of the cover up and I don't think that he wants to be there and that's not a good place for him to be politically\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be used at home by prescription only information that color guard test dot com\n\nThis this year and now President Trump's rally in Mesa, Arizona today is the latest stop us he makes the rounds now less than three weeks before the midterm elections\nHe was in Missoula, Montana yesterday and last weekend he was in Richmond, Kentucky stumping for a Republican who has found himself in an unexpectedly tight race\nRepresentative Andy bar of Kentucky's sixth congressional district is facing a challenge from a military veteran Democrat Amy McGrath and Democrats have high hopes for that seat\nRoland Barton is a state house reporter for Kentucky public radio and he joined us for this week's district profile a role in this district is in the northeast part of the state it includes Lexington and President Trump wanted by Fifteen points in twenty sixteen what else can you tell us about it\nOr ... cents from a Kentucky second largest city Lexington over to the foothills of Appalachia includes kind of a mix of urban in ...\nYears Andy bar the current congressman was first elected in two thousand twelve he replaced a Democrat who had been there for a couple of terms\nAll right let's listen to Andy bar here's a recent add\nTo grow our economy and create more opportunities I voted for middle class tax cuts the average family in Kentucky will get over two thousand dollars more in their yearly paycheck and that's money you can use to save investing more spending on whatever you need\nSo congressman Barr is touting his record with tax cuts what else uh has he done over the years what would have voters know him for\nBeyond the tax cuts bill which has been kind of the main conversation driver of this election season for him\nIt's also been a he he really push for rolling back the Dodd Frank consumer protections are so he was a part of that bill which passed out of Congress earlier this year he was saying that it was something that really affected local banks and the uh kept them from basically being able to get lines of credit affected the you know\nFolks like especially rural farmers and folks in rural parts of the state and this is rolling back the regulations that were put in place Dodd Frank after the financial crisis right\nExactly um bar is a a ... really supportive of the president those kind of a question as to whether or not he would in this purple district run away from the president because there's all there's been a whole lot of anger over the last couple years especially over Republicans attempts to\nRepeal and replace Obamacare a and he has a he's had some really loud and angry town hall meetings where people showed up\nKentucky's one state that really embrace the Affordable CARE Act over five hundred thousand people got health coverage both through the expansion of Medicaid in through you know getting insurance the Obamacare exchanges\nAnd he's really held his ground on that but he says he still wants to repeal more elements of the Ford will CARE Act and he stands by his vote last year in favor of the the attempts to repeal\nNow that's an issue actually that his opponent Amy McGrath is trying to use against and she's a retired Marine fighter pilot and here's a recent ad from her campaign the shows are going through a day trying to wrangle her three young kids get them to the doctor\nMy nine combat missions as us and my nightmares mission is running for Congress to take on politicians who played party ever country but some days this is I think health care is a fundamental right that should be guaranteed\nWhat else can you tell us about any McGrath\nRetired Marine fighter pilots she's the first woman to fly or an F. Eighteen into combat and uh\nYou know she prided herself on really trying to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts\nIs most evident last week she brought for vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in ... the town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came\nTo see the vice president now the thing about any McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars it about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and it's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere's certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know may nationwide interest in this race\nI mean it's at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more\nTV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November sick and what do the polls say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there's no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge and and really isn't something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nSo Kentucky ... congressional district will be one of those key places people are watching to see if Democrats can take a seat from Republicans and flip the house in the Democrats' favor and that's why Lynn Barton statehouse reporter for Kentucky public radio thank you thanks Peter\nThe TV show the counters premiered this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr\nABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was a hit it was cancelled though after it start tweeted racist remarks now the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher Rick\nHi so the first episode is a send off to the character Roseanne Connor we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office\nIt's not possible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grin and morbid what do you think\n[noise] I think uh she's right but I also think the storytelling worked so [laughter]\nUm they had for shadow that I'm Roseanne Connor the character would be struggling with a an addiction and pain pills and so if they're gonna kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and it also hooks it into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talk about because of the way that there was any kind of character\nPass to well all important issues the question is who saw the show are and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors word down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on average you tuned into Roseanne when they returned last march\nRight but um there's a few things going on there and I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting\nAnd then you also had news that the rose encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter\nAnd I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show so I think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of its run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so\nI don't think the Connors is going to get to that level but it's drawing about the same audience that Roseanne the revival was doing when it ended its run in may\nAnd then it's going to be their challenge to kind of building the audience\nAnd retain people who may have just watched the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to Roseanne character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the ... than they did and Roseanne\nI seen two episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show that tried to talk about all of the different issues that face to working class family and it wasn't quite as part is and I mean\nI I have to say I I I watched that show a lot out when I was growing up and I never thought of it as a political show at all\nYeah I mean I think it actually was a political show it just wasn't about a particular political party so now the shows kind of back to what it was\nThe stereotypes of people might have about working class families and talking honestly about the issues they face and they're also talking a bit about gay rights because one of the characters came out during the episode and I think we have a clip of that let's check it out\nYou know oh I was kind of waiting for you to tell me about it takes a long\nTerm care whether it happen again [noise]\nSo now this is interesting because the character is basically ... grandson he seemed to address and kind of I'm In a in a feminine way in the revival and they had an episode that kind of dealt with that but I think they were sort of insistent that he wasn't necessarily gay now they have this character saying that he is gay\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of W.

rough couple of weeks or three percent drop last Wednesday or one per ... per cent decline yesterday\nOf course that's nothing compared to what happened thirty one years ago today when the u._s. stock market dropped twenty two point six percent the largest single day loss in us history\nNew York times financial reporter Diana Henry case wrote about what led up to that day and what can be learned from it in her book a first class catastrophe the road to black Monday the worst day in Wall Street history I spoke with her last September and began by asking her what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWell talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew\nThe Nineteen eighty seven crash I Lived through it myself as a reporter but the mythology that has grown up around black Monday Israeli an amazing monument to Wall Street amnesia and let me tell you\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kinda wanted to solve a mystery here why has black Monday been so forgotten why have we not recognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWell why did you start your book where you did in the seventies because he has to indicate that that was the beginning of what led to a\nGreat question and I drew raised at Jeremy my the book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble and the silver market but what was significant about\nIt it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks the panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces barely knew each other's names\nSo we open on a world where official Washington is still kinda trapped in this delusion that they are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately\nAnd the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion apart for those who were paying attention and then along the way I illustrate the heated occasions when\nA panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive at black Monday you understand that just didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky this was the culmination of a series of\nMisjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWell one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light they were human markets they were trying to operate\nAs they had operated for a hundred years and they were overwhelmed by the pace of automated order delivery\nIn addition if further in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of alert regulators were the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new\nFinancial derivatives that were used in imaginative unusual ways so the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who were creating the new products that would show a effect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this sounds kind of familiar ... after having just lived through the crash of two thousand a you know people talking about a lot of ah fast trading and new products that nobody understands you're exactly right\nThe ... in computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system exactly the same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivatives in high speed heard investing strategies with fragmented oversight so\nWe're right back where we started only with exponentially larger scale and risks\nThat you brought up the issue of regulators you talk in this book about Ronald Reagan who took office uh in Nineteen eighty one and was pushing for smaller government was appointing people who wanted to cut back\nOn regulations how much responsibility did Reagan and his administration have in the crash in Nineteen eighty seven\nWell it's sort of a mixed bag Jeremy yes um there was a new deregulatory fever in Washington the way that played out however was in skimpy rations for the regulators so the to the extent that the regulatory machinery was\nUnder staffed and under financed that was a result of this determination to cut back\nOn big government but I should point out that after the crash it was a blue ribbon commission appointed by President Reagan led by a staunch Republican ... Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a fight regulator in charge in Washington\nSo both you know the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left\nIn the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either a they wanted more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all these new products enough to oversee\nWell that's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have we don't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that\nI think that same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are extremely complex and yes they are\nAlgorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people in the political realm\nBut they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency is appropriately structured appropriately funded and appropriately staffed so that you can understand what's happening on Wall street even if they can't\nDo do you get a better understanding and writing this book of why crashes happen how something that seems small can get out of control very quickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes although it wasn't a big surprise you know we've been laboring for decades under the um the notion of inefficient and market a rational market where investors make rational decisions and and those decisions are incorporated into the prices of securities automatically\nI never found that particularly persuasive I've got to be a good appreciation for how people panic in a crisis\nBut after researching a black Monday I don't understand how anyone can believe that that's an accurate explanation of how markets work\nWe're human beings we bring a lot of baggage to our investment decisions we could frightened we indulgent wishful thinking we ignore the red flags until it's too late that's the nature of the human mind\nI'm sure a lot of people on Wall street are going to read your book what about people who don't work on Wall street or don't work in the financial industry what do you want them to take away I Want\nThem first of all to understand that this is not a mom and pop market we're the mice on the elephants dance floor here\nAnd we need to understand our role what I Hope they will take away from the book\nIs a clearer picture of how today's market works and how we got here but I also hope they will realize that when the elephants or stamp heating and running around with their ears on fire what they should do what you and I should do is stay calm stand pat", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "19"}
