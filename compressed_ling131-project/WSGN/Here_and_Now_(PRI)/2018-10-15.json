hundred nine four seven auto\nIt's here and now back to President Trump's comments last night on sixty minutes continuing to question the importance of addressing climate change\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nWell others are pushing forward in fact they're fighting there saying that fighting climate change can be job producing and that we're running out of time according to last week's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change there's just about a decade left to take unprecedented action to reduce to reduce the extreme impacts of climate change\nThe report recommends reducing current emission is being released into the atmosphere but also capturing the carbon dioxide that's already up there what's known as negative emissions so let's take a look with Gregory ... a professor of public affairs and environmental studies at the ... school of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison\nProfessor technologies will be needed to do this but one of the easiest way the a carbon dioxide out of the plants right because they just suck it out\nYeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take ... to the atmosphere and then store it in two would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing in all of these uh schemes to remove the uh to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one with planting more trees is that if you're planting trees\nThis is growing food um that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects of even things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because the scale has to be so large\nWell and also we know that Kay trees only store carbon for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there's a permanent issue with a story and see what two in um injuries that um is not such an issue for storing it underground for example ... so let's\nMove on to some of the other ideas carbon capture and storage what are some of the ideas there\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid CEO to going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions there is a way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme by again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy you takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops than you burn the crops in the power plant and instead of putting that suit to back into the atmosphere you're going to do the same thing compress it and stored underground and that has the potential to remove\nA billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground were tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to\nIt has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for crops that we're going to use to store CEO to and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could\nA Korean food security issues which is something we want to avoid what about ... and by the way I\nJust said Steven thinkers chicken provocative new book a night and it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along but what about just sucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical process to use\nRemove the CEO to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the idea is could we do that at an industrial scale and capture CEO to that's in the air\nCapture that seemed to compress it and then store underground\nThat is appealing one of the most appealing aspects of that is it doesn't have this large land impact that almost every other one of the schemes has the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive thing so\nSomething like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes\nCrime or actually ... started up and they say the conflict between six hundred and eight hundred for magic ... to ... I'm getting another company in Canada and protect crushing two hundred fifty ... ... it's catching snake\nThat's expensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to over the whole world now I think a number of about five dollars is about right there's other places it's high like in Sweden and then you you've got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about those technology is is the concept come down so as you say claim works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of CEO to\nTheir next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of CEO to\nThere's another company called carbon engineering and Canada has thinks it can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat that uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year\nAnd they think that'll be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so this idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it\nIt seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built without severe problems and with costs that seem to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have a lemon juice impacts\nOne of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of C. O. two by mid century um and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned that's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I I think that adds up to about four hundred\nThat's the real challenge for direct heir captures how you scale up from three companies doing on the order of five or six plants to something like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten\nYears [laughter] what six hundred thousand well are you getting the investors excited about that [laughter]\nYou know that that may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes set the more speculative end of this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock it takes up CEO to as weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve or C. O. two in the water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate photosynthesis like plankton and again success CEO two out of the atmosphere in different ways what do you say though\nTo how her job I'm a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in the fact that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing its CEO to emissions if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah yeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes called uh the jargon you turn for his moral hazard this idea that if you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case it means you won't reduce emissions are enough\nI actually think we're not we don't really have the the luxury of dismissing this negative emotions technology is something that I'm able to take away our incentives I mean it's kind of like you know an insurance policy for health insurance or fire insurance or something like that where\nYeah maybe there is a sense in which if you have the insurance she'll be less careful about fires in your house but on the other hand most people still want to have a insurance because it's it's worth it to them and it's worth it to society and I think that's kind of the way we have to\nHave to look at it I think the other thing is you know we're\nWe're not a reducing emissions enough\nAlready even without talking about negative and mission so I think\nTo say that the reason we're not reducing emissions us because we've got this a breakthrough technology that we can use in the future I don't think that's um that's really what's what's limiting us and I don't think it'll be enough just to have the negative and there's just so we really need both we need to\nI'll tell you I'm One morning It's MORNING edition costs the station five hundred and Seventy five dollars to air one afternoon of all things considered costs the station about four hundred dollars to air we pay those programming costs to NPR and we are happy to do it because it's the best radio news programming there is\nBut we want we need to bring that to you and it comes at a cost and you help us with that uh we have out in ... the news room in an amazing staff here WBAI gym that do great work uh and are part of it's part of the mission um we all want to do this work\nBut it costs money and you help one eight hundred for for for nine two four six is the number to call WBAI Jim dot org is the address\nSupport comes from our members of course thank you and from ... school of business now welcoming students and visitors to what's new home on university bullets\nFor NPR station Ninety point three WB H um Birmingham and one oh four point five FM in Fort Paine public radio for the heart of Alabama online at W.

us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of production Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's gonna happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see is a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to our race about uncertainty and one way that we are a uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nThe experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least\nBeing exactly where you are right now um but you know where we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecast as they always get things wrong it exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other domains [noise] is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise]\nUm they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average in is the goal of a forecast to change the future\nTo be able to make a decision once you know what's going to happen or once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting and entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask yourself is this person just trying to get me district goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\n[noise] well I always liked to say that the nineteenth\nBombed by Paul Ehrlich who was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong ah and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and and happily for humidity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all ... they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um\nWell reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts little forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as a person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was gonna win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I said it was going to happen [laughter] yup\nAnd you know look it's a there's an old saying about mutual funds you know you start\nFive hundred mutual funds and you just bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that had big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future babble and co author of super forecasting the art and science of production Dan thank you so much for joining us\nThank you well let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise here and now dot org defending the Santa Ana winds blew into Southern California today prompting the national weather service to issue a red alert for fire danger\nIn late July the Carr Fire swept through parts of the city of reading and the surrounding area

really respond in a high magnitude way to storms falling out or we don't have a modest here\nMontecito on the coast just north of Los Angeles was hit with monster mudslides last January when heavy

E. with generous financial incentives her opponent Alan ... who was mayor of the city of Cranston is not impressed\nWith culture that the governor subscribe to a corporate welfare [noise] goes millions that have been given for many uh developments\nProduced only a few construction job no long term jobs that's going to be dramatically reformed and many of those millions are going to be caught\nAnd fun has his own challenges in this blue state he has to tout his conservative credentials without hewing too closely to President Trump and then there's this wild card\nYou deny our knowledge and draw boat from Mr ... I Want to draw votes for the vote for\nJoe shrill oh news running as an independent and he could get a big chunk of conservative votes at phones expense driller was the chair of President Trump's twenty sixteen campaign in Rhode Island\nOf money in it as a ...\nGreat in their in their eyes into Vermont [laughter] I'm tired of the party politics [noise]\nSo how will those three candidates do in the race for\nTo get some answers to that question I went to this very busy street corner in doubt\nAnd she's been following politics in this state for a very long time I lived in Rhode Island to thirty three years you know the lay of the land is pretty much yeah why did you bring me right here in this spot in downtown Providence\nI thought if we were talking about this race this would be a good place to illustrate some of the changes that have gone on in the past decade that we were in the worst shape after and during the recession we were at the bottom and we were the last to come out of the recession you know I've\nHeard this a couple of times talking to Rhode islanders you were the first to go in\nAnd you were one of the last to come out right and I think that's because we had a a workforce that was relatively uh on train for new technology but up until fairly recently\nThey were able to make a living in manufacturing a good middle class living\nCottages little cottages down the shore and things like that\nBut all that changed you know in the eighties and the nineties so in the recession hit we really weren't prepared\nFor what was coming and it struck it it really hit us very hard how much did that pain affect the political psyche of the people here I think they were pretty cynical about politics because we had been so long at a disadvantage economically and people people are promised things and not a lot of big changes occurred\nIn addition to that there was a sort of a Hail Mary pass made by the last administration a Republican administration\nThat attempted to a fun with state funds are gaming sort of video games will Curt Schilling that went bust in the Boston Red Sox pitcher the Boston Red Sox Fisher it cost us like you know over like Ninety million dollars initially was on some of the money back\nBut that really gave people a jaded perspective on economic development and what people were doing the added to the you know the the long downturn and sort of deep recession we had\nThis was an attempt to pull us out and\nIt failed and it left\nPeople pretty cynical and yet here we are today twenty Eighteen we're about to come up on the mid term elections in a big gubernatorial election here in Rhode Island and we see construction crews here will\nWell the thing is we are in a good spot now in other words we have come out of this recession our unemployment numbers are above the national average I think that's why you see all the trains in the sky and so forth\nGo ahead but not by that much is that a surprise to you in a blue state like\nThis is going to be an interesting race it's not going to be a a takeoff Regina reminder she's going to have to work really hard and she's going to have to get out of her voters so in that sense I Am not surprised there are people in this state who are concerned about old Rhode Island what it was like ... and Alan songs message resonates with him\nGot a good story he's got a good story he's the son of Chinese immigrants he worked in a um Chinese restaurants\nThe when the uh the local college where she is Yale Harvard roads are so it's a very very different picture\nThe most recent University of New Hampshire poll which came out after my conversation with Maureen mostly has Mondo pulling ahead but even in deep blue New England you can't discount the conservative vote and there are pockets of Rhode Island were fun will do well\nWe were walking by his water water and a\nFour miles a day rain snow sleet right here in this part of the most part\nI met funk supporter Ron and cone and his friend Alan shack in on their daily walk around a pretty little park in the city of Johnston Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by fourteen points two years ago\nWhat are you leaning towards right now I'm going towards one yes and was that because we need change change of leadership what's wrong with the way the state's going\nBankrupt though the pension funds are not funded that's the problem\nYou brought up a very controversial point Gina Raimondo and what you did with the pension is that something that's still bothers you got still\nAbout me and people started walk
