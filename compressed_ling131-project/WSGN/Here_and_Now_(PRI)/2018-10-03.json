George Smith and one British scientist Gregory Winter are sharing the prize let's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas at Kansas State university\nUh Peter welcome at first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that\n[noise] so first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates\nThere they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOr the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery in the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most\nAnd ah being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that cell lived through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside is in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this works significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a simple cell as we might think of it and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry in a beaker a flask\nWe control of fewer of ah the the variables and and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we'll alternately observe\nBut in all you know living sell like uh uh whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so it's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker\nAnd ... the real breakthroughs here to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur in the next generation as opposed to waiting for the slow evolutionary process as it is really what so spectacular\nHere and now we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications of this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but\nTo be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in so imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells\nAnd have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex chemical reactions but do them in a very clean environment\nAnd so really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these\nAn example um all the natural process are created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the war on generates um ethanol\nOr alcohol and then the production of beer or wine okay let's talk about one of the winners Francis Arnold of Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had one and she was remarkably calm\nYou're away from him so perhaps some projects protected from the immediate ... happen today\nWell I think I Can't reach here so [laughter] I guess I Would say that I Love or money [laughter]\nOr as a Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna strict Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work\nWhat does all of that meeting for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] well I also point out that from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry so we're recognized as laureates and the same year\nUm and but you're absolutely right in the case of professor Arnold um she's the fifth woman and prior to that it was ... the Hodgkin's in\nNineteen sixty four that was recognized and then you start going way back to Marie Curie in Nineteen eleven and then actually her daughter um several uh two decades later so\nFor us in the American Chemical Society where we're at and then some for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science is specifically um for folks from all different backgrounds and and perspectives and for us recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\nPeter door how is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas I thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you very much Peter and I'm a ... I Wish everyone a great day\n\nIf you're in Durango and it's because lego sculptures had been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the ... bridge I'm the lego bomber from Colorado Public radio Stephanie will has this story [noise]\nSan Britain asked me to meet him outside a coffee shop on drained his main avenue and to wear newspaper hats and he could identify me I have light and I keep an eye out for an adult male in this city\nInstead and greeted by a blonde haired eleven year old\nHe tells me he's than the lego bomber and take me on a tour of quote\nThis Sam leads me to lego sculptures around the town many are surprisingly discreet you have to look up or down to see one posted outside businesses and I almost missed the Lakers and the sign for the old main post office they look like they're part of the stone were and the post office is called\nUp that well we put it up only a couple of days ago but\nOur tour ends at an old junior high school that's been converted into space for yoga and art classes there we find a bright green centipede like a lego creature crawling up a wall along with sand but I finally called them out on his crews and remind him I've seen pictures of the actual San bridge him\nWell they're taking photos of the older me okay\nThe older Sam who is was born in the sixties can meet their all their Sam today probably okay can you grow up right now okay [laughter]\nYounger sand disappears down stairwells an older San emerges from around the building or you know older than\n[laughter]\n[laughter] Oh nice to meet you [laughter]\nWell I think probably it's\nHard to get that young [laughter]\nI I learned virgins impersonator is ... and one of his assistants he has a posse of them but one bridge in began lego bombing two years ago it was a solo endeavor\nI was just really frustrated one night on line in my bed and I'm I'm I'm not ordinarily are praying man but I Try to give it a try got nothing and are just so ... decided to go into was something\nHe happened to have hundreds of lego is lying around because he teaches lego robotics there his own business called alpine educational associates so it just took all these\nMisinterpreted as art and the euro and put a [noise]\nNow many of his young lego robotic students helped him construct ... around the city including places like Starbucks side or the window at the drive through pharmacy out of ...\nThis is Seth an issue from Colorado Public\nRadio and I am taking off on a tour\nMelissa Sullivan who goes by ... is a senior pharmacy technician at ... through the drive through intercom system she tells me that she loves having the Lakers culture there\nFunding for here know comes from the listeners of W.

investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history was an an apple pie August\nHere and now it was the part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cast treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried at that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked forward they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying the national sexual assault hotline report it is the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like it's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is\nStay on friday our calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase called on your right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody in a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that yeah\nAbsolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if they are right back in that moment today if\nThey feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words is it about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help it when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIs the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we are going to fight\nWe're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and was lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less that intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about as well from the survivors\nThey thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor read presidents ing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define are frequently what the worst part of that experience wives\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain\nTo literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to a what that was exactly like for her and say yes yes yeah\nLook the majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani a Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter revealed that she'd been raped by a music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to me his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you guess are don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many [noise]\nWhat\n[noise]\nEmpathy below again from the Chicago rape crisis centers what happens when you have this huge national\nWe are hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just man but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victims of the main and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause as Dr Ford said and as so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault without assault was five days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years\nReally lives the incredible complexity of the way that the brain operates and and honestly contributes to victim blaming and myth making around sexual assault and sexual violence\nAnd we should say that Christine Blasey Ford did describe some of the things the president said that she didn't but\nAt any rate uh others have said it's like trying to describe a nightmare so we await the FBI's investigation and the Senate decision tomorrow what ... what are you bracing for\nWe're bracing for increase calls a two hour hotline we're bracing for increased requests for counseling we're bracing for our current clients experiencing triggers and I\nThink survivor is find themselves you know in this incredibly powerful moment caught between pressure to come forward and a feeling that their experience will be invalidated I think this is an incredibly critical moment for our country for our government for survivors of sexual violence across the country\nThe Tempest yellow she heads to

I Wish everyone a great day\n[noise]\nAnd that was nice let's go to Colorado now for a story that many of us may have missed but not if you're in Durango that's because lego sculptures had been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the work of sand bridging the lego Bonner from Colorado Public radio Stephanie will has their story [noise]\nThan Britain asked me to meet him outside a coffee shop and drained goes may not to an end to wear newspaper hats and he could identify me I have lights and I keep an eye out for an adult male any fifty instead and greeted by a blonde haired eleven year old\nHe tells me he's than the leg up on her and take me on a tour of quote his art\nPosted outside businesses and I almost missed the Lakers and the sign for the old main post office they look like they're part of the stone work and the post office is called\nThey said well we put it up only a couple of days ago but\nOur tour ends at an old junior high school that's been converted into space for yoga and art classes there we find a bright green centipede like a lego creature crawling up a wall along with sand but I finally called them out on his crews and remind him I've seen pictures of the actual than Britain\nWell they're taking photos of the older me okay\nThe older Sam who is was born in the sixties can meet their all their Sam today probably okay can you grow up right now okay [laughter]\nYounger sand disappears down stairwells an older San emerges from around the building or you the older than\n[laughter]\nHi nice to meet you [laughter]\nMy point it's\nHard for me to get that young [laughter]\nI I learned Britain's impersonator is ... and one of his assistants he has a posse of them but when Britain began lego bombing two years ago it was a solo endeavor\nI was just really frustrated one night on line in my bed and I'm I'm I'm not ordinarily are praying man but I Try to I gave it a try got nothing and are just felt really irritated decided to go vandalized something\nHe happened to have hundreds of lego is lying around because he teaches lego robotics there his own business called alpine educational associates\nSo it just took all these lego some plastered on a on a post trying to offend somebody and what are you know it was wildly misinterpreted as art and the euro and put a [noise]\nNow many of his young lego robotic students helped him construct ... around the city including places like Starbucks side or the window at the drive through pharmacy out of ... this is Seth I knew she some little public\nRadio I'm taking her on a tour\nMelissa Sullivan who goes by ... is a senior pharmacy technician at Walgreen through the drive through intercom system she tells me that she loves having the Lakers culture there\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W. B. U. R. Boston and your NPR station\nFrom home advisor matching homeowners was home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects for minor repairs to major re models homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd WB you are and the Boston Globe was last seen the new true crime podcast sponsored by Samuel Adams investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history listen and apple pie August\nHere and now it was a part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was\nAlleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cash treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like lassie Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried at that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying the national sexual assault hotline reported the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls a seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nBeen very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which\nIs a nearly doubled from the week prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago or say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call volume right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that smaller to Dr Ford they're experiencing are we ... we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of trauma are still with folks\nEven decades later when you say\nIt might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding or they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this isn't about sex did did people do people when they come for help it when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIn the ... the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma\nOur brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we are going to fight we're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and ... the Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less that intense feeling of fear and we're hearing that as well from the survivors that we work with\nMe usually people have a flashback she's also explained us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talked to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to their response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain to literally ... presents themselves in ...\nActually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to a what that was exactly like for her and said yes yes yeah look\nThe majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by him music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know it was happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get started on remember where is the point I don't remember how many years you know [noise]\nWhat\nWas I don't know [noise] and pillow again from\nThe Chicago rape crisis centers what happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling safe to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just man but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated\nBy the national conversation by the victim the mean and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this fact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause it Dr Ford said and as so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details\nA part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault would aren't that assault was five days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years\nReally lives the incredible complexity of the way that the brain operates and and honestly contributes to victim blaming and myth making around sexual assault and sexual violence\nAnd we should say that Christine Blasey Ford did describe some of the things the president said that she didn't but at any rate uh others has said it's like trying to describe the nightmare so we await the FBI's investigation and the Senate decision tomorrow what ... what are you bracing for\nWe're bracing for increase calls a two hour hotline we're bracing for increased requests for counseling we're bracing for our current clients experiencing triggers and I\nThink survivor is find themselves you know in this incredibly powerful moment caught between pressure to come forward and a feeling that their experience will be invalidated I think this is an incredibly critical moment for our country for our government for survivors of sexual violence across the country\nThey tend to feel oh she has to clinical program at the YWCA metropolitan Chicago they run the hotlines and all three rape crisis center there and thank you so much thank you [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "03"}
