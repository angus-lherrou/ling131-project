mission a knock on some ...\nBig that victory will be um I Am still one who thinks there will be a new things like not just the house but also some governors' mansions and state legislatures that we cannot predict level turnout Democrats favor John\nWell first of all and the Republican side the more we if we could get Nancy Pelosi on all the stations all day long we're we're all for it because it seems to fire up our base at least quite a bit but\nI look historically we know that whether it's a Republican or Democrat president two years into their terms the other party does well I I think there is no reason to believe that history is not going to repeat itself\nThe question as to what level I Do think that the house majority is certainly and play I Would not be terribly shocked if the Democrats won the majority\nOn the other hand I Do think the Democrats are going to lose seats and the Senate and so it's going to result in a a sort of mixed I'm a control of government and what

committed suicide in Las Vegas\nJon ultimately submitted that is said to the San Francisco magazine the believer and this was launched a seven year holy war over facts to gotta an essay is said facts could be fluid it was the impact of the story that mattered\nHis fact checker Jim single took a binary approach something was a factor or wasn't and facts were sacred soon single produce Ninety pages of inaccuracies which the two turned into a book with email exchanges like the following one read by our colleagues\nSingle questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John to God has said it was nine seconds but the Carter said it was eight\nYeah a budget that doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them in the fall for nine seconds rather than aid in order to help make some of the leaders themes in the essay work John changing detail\nWell with details that relate directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in assuming his fall took nine seconds for a while as parents also assume that he had fallen for nine seconds but now you do no better so shouldn't change\nNine is to enter blow a part of the essay at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway so the answer is not changing it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact with powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John D'Agata Harry Potter I mean Daniel Radcliffe\nAs fact checker Jim single and cherry Jones as an editor referee the to the seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the three are trapped in an

backstage with all three before recent matinee as veterans of the stage can you feel that we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of their seat it's like I don't want to try to outdo the critics here with describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ...\nYeah thank you it feels like we're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take a moment and just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company of easy for the first time ...\nAnd yeah I mean I I've never done a play before the housing argument at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment and some of gyms ... like make the audience go oh this guy's name ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous to told I find like five you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear this he kept going yeah we did when when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players have to be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the ...\nSeeing a lot of cars I've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I hurt people actually left and it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives who've flown in from\nAll over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they came they gave us for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use to use\nYour character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's a ... she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and Dana damn it every night as I come down to the moment if the play where decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me I'm going to soften you if you publish Eleanor every night and the other guy that's going to be called post show the briefings\nFor your money [laughter] and go wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I can talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one strip clubs that three four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or news conference\nBetween it is a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs really different to be the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play\nOr the difference in in an artistic peace being written and that's it you know what would you say about the Greek history what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four 'cause you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously this that you care just not a bad guy we're in real life\nGuide anyway he's just he's a writer recon aren't\nReal life he he has said that the real writer has said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroyed them and they continue to do so um\nI don't think it's fair John does it work for the Washington Post he was not writing articles for writing articles from New York Times he's used illuminating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that follows it a long line of tradition why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say to all these artists you get\nBother your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nWith his own world the facts to choose from the wrong facts given the way of the story and your cats are says the wrong facts what does that mean exactly\nWhat you gotta be aware that we have a presidential jokes person Kellyanne Conway who spoke of alternative facts are not very\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and frequently gets applause\nThe argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in at the whole thing can for the call for you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debating about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is going to going oh come on clearly you are going to follow this is no difference the masses you know Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating and certain point what do you think will start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and joined gets more intense you'd\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talk about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance is at a\nStrangling each yes yes I'm already know winning that fight [laughter] bother us strangling Daniel okay\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way but\nThen you you actually got a taste of this she went to the New Yorker and you were a fact checker for a day barely hands shaking on your red and you know when you made a call you had to call the restaurant tour after someone wrote a review so you had to check the

communities worldwide learn more at poster Smith dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis this year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are and I do not is because one state\nThe brass guy does not have the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\nWell they run on issues like lowering lowering taxes uh they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care at a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level\nAnd so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty censuses right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled and less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday\nAnd you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policy making in the next legislative sessions and two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have ended their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nFor a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense\nA trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is ... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislators who are isn't in who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um and then to your point it then it does sort of turned into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race or that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several states\nI ... in Minnesota there's one special election and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protect on the Democratic side and they have\nReally ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys\nUm you know things you would see in congressional races you now see fairly commonly pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they've just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention\nTo the state races but both parties are going all in on these races\nYou said President Obama said ... I remember President George W. Bush called the law says that he faced a thumping I think maybe it's now or something that the president has to do is come up with a word or for that first midterm election if it doesn't go out for their part yeah\nYeah that's a great that's a great point that you know if the Republicans I'm really take it on the ... and it turns into a a really bad night or a large a democratic night um then yeah they'll have to get creative get the works miss a generating\nThe dismal words that are ... and now I guess with Simon and ...

talk immigration after visiting Pittsburgh yesterday to pay respects after the synagogue shooting Democrats across the country are making their final pitch to voters many focusing their message on healthcare\nWe're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Hi Mara high there so you were about to join President Trump in his latest campaign pushy is heading to Florida or one of the things people have noticed about his schedule a leading up to the midterms at this point is that he seems to be focused\nMainly on Senate races as he given up on Republicans keeping the house\nI don't think he's given up I think Republicans are engaged in the mad scramble to keep their losses in the house as low as possible but the president has been going to red states states where he's popular he doesn't he isn't campaigning in blue\nDistricts where he's not popular and it just so happens that this year the Senate battleground is a bunch of very red states that he won where his approval rating is very high and they're just happens to be Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re election in those states so that's where he's focusing\nMeanwhile he's been talking as we've been talking about the last twenty four hours or so about ending so called birthright citizenship he said today on Twitter that it will be ended one way or the other even though it is protected by the constitution and constitutional scholars have said it would not be possible for him to ended by executive\nOrder we remember that it was a week ago Marta that he was talking about passing a middle

polls show that people think it was a tax cut for the rich and not for them\nIs so huge appealing to his base but can Republicans do what they want to do in these midterms just with the base [noise]\nWell that's what the president's theory is it's always all about the base with him\nAnd the problem for a lot of Republicans in these affluent educated suburban districts is they need more than the base they need independent voters and they've been struggling a members of Congress in those districts have been struggling [noise]\nWhat about the other big story of this week which is of course the the terrible I'm shooting in Pittsburgh and a following up on the pipe bombs that were sent to some of the ... the president's critics I he's been blaming the media\nFor climate of violence creating our climate of violence on many had been blaming him and his rhetoric water voters thinking as they look at all that\nWell what we have seen is over the last week or two his approval rating

dozen people gather together to come up with amendments to the state constitution Florida is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL aren't explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace or you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military\nThese two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the ... commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable\nI think that what the constitution and vision commission did is it packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but thought wouldn't be popular\nHow Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county to have five\nThe gym it's it's sandwiched in between motherhood and apple pie\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom and some legal experts at this time is different\n[noise] Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men and almost even split between the two parties says Alan Freed and\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans a Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not Ana Marie cameras was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\n... offers the example of amendment ... which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beans and my voting record would speak to that\nBut for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\nCamus says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible I sell the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nOr some what they are voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle justice body into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where for here and now I'm Danny Rivera in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election\nDay this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all take who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other\nYears overall the total number of measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature petition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become\nLaw or is it something that just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with\nElections and voting [noise] yeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year\nUh other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri how difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThe process varies by state the number of signatures required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives so does that mean\nCuba voter there are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group but a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on the ballot\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and another cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove the rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process is used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine that last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked the implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty sixty initiatives was\nIn many cases to either repeal or um changed the initiatives if possible in some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty eight team with an issue proponents instead of letting it go to the ballot and letting it be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where an issue opponents withdraw and the policies still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it\nWhat is the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the u._s. um every state but Delaware it's a forty nine states require voters to ratify constitutional amendments so even if the legislature puts it on the ballot the voters still have to vote\nHistory or a corporation or an out of state interest or grassroots volunteer efforts can put a measure on the ballot by collecting a certain number of signatures only twenty six states have any process that similar to that\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and your

office has referred to the FBI that women were offering money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him NPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email us they tried to investigate and report on it\nOr is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that need it was too that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in a special counsel's office that it it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI\nAnd well there are two conservative media personalities Jacob all and jet Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friend and supporter Chris Reddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that its own founded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office in Miller himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involved\nSo we're going to ... and also on gay we pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report that was linked to a so called\nA intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified ah because no one knows which things into their true and which things are not and it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in\nPages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors or models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so our ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women just say something about ... I mean what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap\nTo try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office has this has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there are some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nBehind all in other words if somebody was masking a masquerading as a woman saying that there were sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you well meanwhile earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end a temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have an immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lived there are already turned upside down during the ten ... plus months when they believe they'd have to leave the United states he\n... is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan it say recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago was prepared to lose her temporary protected status on November second which had been the deadline she joins us in the studio welcome\nThank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U.

...\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and\nFrequently gets applause the argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in it the whole thing can photo policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying you know that's one point in the play where it would debating about the length of time this person fell for it\nYou got Jim wants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating at certain points given single start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of like picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense you'd\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talk about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance is\nStrangling each yes has already know winning that fight [laughter] I saw the U.S strongly Daniel okay\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way\nBut Daniel you actually got a taste of this she went to the New Yorker and you were a fact checker for a day barely hands shaking on your red and when you made a call you had to\nCall the restaurant tour after someone wrote a review so you had to check the description of the food and as I was doing I was like well I guess every ingredient mentioned as a Fox so I'm just going to have to also came about every single ingredient as mentioned it and I only missed one they were ready to hire him on the spot you with us very gone yeah just the fact you miss\n[noise] remember now and it was ... ... s on restaurant Oh yes yes I didn't underlying restaurants which I should have because I should have checked if it was in fact plural and he had had two previous restaurants or one previous restaurant\nI have to ask you are actors you've all been written about do you come away from this play feeling better about the press more frightened about the press on my God if there are only thirty one strip clubs and we're writing thirty four\nYou've got to read listen see with your eyes as much as you possibly can in these days and then check and fact check I mean to be honest there's such\nTuesday night beginning at seven o'clock on Ninety point three W. B. H M\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and your NPR station\nPoster Smith printing posters on wrinkled resistant fold double fabric that transports flat for conference presentations poster Smith provides a service to research communities worldwide learn more poster Smith dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had\nNational international and local news\nElections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures high ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they're Ninety nine is because one state\nThe brass guy does not have both the house and Senate they only have one chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the same level well\nOver well with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms hum and really\nHad a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments are in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policy making on issues like education public safety health care at a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level\nAnd so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans an edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nIs correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator lined that's another\nIn two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines that were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty censuses right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled in less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday\nAnd you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policy making in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year uh what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind it their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nFor a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out\nUm almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country and there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\n... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats and legislators as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the\nDemocrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years um they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ...\nInto a when we've been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year\nAnd despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislature who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um and then to your point it then it does sort of turned into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting\nThe races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had so in this cycle particular on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend the money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you know see\nFairly commonly pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they've just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention to the state races but both parties are going all in all of these races\nYou said President Obama said ... I remember President George W. Bush called the law says that he faced a thumping I think maybe it's now or something that the president has to do is come up with the word or for that first midterm election if it doesn't go out for their part yeah [laughter] yeah\nThat's a great that's a great point that you know if the Republicans I'm really take it on the chin and ... and it turns into a a really bad night or a large a democratic night um then yeah they'll have to get creative get the word Smith is generating\nThe dismal words that are whose analogous with ... and ...
