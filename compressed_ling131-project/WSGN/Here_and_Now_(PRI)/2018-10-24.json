former felons have to wait at least five years and petition the state board to win back their rights\nBut on November sex voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution and automatically grant the right to vote to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence unless they were convicted of murder or a sex crime here now is Chris Bentley took a closer look\n[noise] it's opening day after living harvest a thrift shop and south LA assay the stores managed in staffed by former felons making the transition back into society [noise]\nDale why does the nonprofit found [noise] he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for felony DUI and it was released in the year two thousand since then he's gotten sober and started this nonprofit\nIt is because I Know people change and I know the way I was if those people will have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for the\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a former felon himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returning home and try to rebuild my life part of that wanting to be a part of the community could happen in most I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for a non violent felons to gain their rights back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott has approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Canaan remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nA set of the car [laughter] I don't even know how do they even go into building fell deprived of felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad feelings that thing that I I haven't even forgive him or suffer feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently refill amongst other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he says there are a fair criticism is at the current process service during voting rights but giving what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong and potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for\nA whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe Leon county sheriff wall to make Neal agrees with Harris and then it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nLeads to other things like ah you know the sexual batters who are as keeping them away from kids in the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those appropriate steps to take but just the fundamental right to vote there's no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nThe tourists them from any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only served to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to uh give up and turned to a life of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made them feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted in office through next certain things but I never got involved because I said what I can make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen it kind of made me feel like well if I'm not a citizen ...\nSawyer recently got his rights restored him while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if he'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it was kind of like a a book of this is part of a bucket list I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level and then I just me but I like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in a case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box and November\nFor here and now I'm Chris ... in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three ...\nAbout their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her highland even person I'm explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get to hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into this\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you here of course wanted you to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis picky queens\nUm all part of a you could say a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for three decisions is the fourth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they couldn't\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues\nAnd that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders and this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nThis is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today\nWould bow to pressure by out of state radical groups to pick 'em up these activists judges that you just referred to houses that factoring into that campaign\nWell it's certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raise and to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make\nThe way you know you're right because we've been asking people on the street you know he's got them big decision you know you've got to speak to what they they do a lot of people don't know about it\nA lot of people don't know about it and it's been flying under the radar for years you know this has been a conversation at a question that has gone back really for decades um we had the first attempt to do this and twenty fourteen to a constitutional amendment\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

general contractors of America showed that eight out of ten building firms in the U.S can't find labor and in Florida it's even worse and that was the for hurricane Michael flattened entire town [noise]\nThis week we hadn't out to a building site to meet up with members of the Tallahassee builders association Lynn Edwards\nIs executive officer Doug Barton is the current president Mike Castle the incoming president we started with Doug\nSo when it comes to work is just give me that some of the problem that you're seeing and getting workers here\nIn two thousand seven recession we lost fifty percent of our industry and they have not return and found other work so as things if the backup we're still working with half our workforce\nA lot of people left the industry and then I'm Mark you're left with people who might have aged out of the industry retired\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact our average age framing contractor is fifty seven years old\nSo can you give me the kinds of jobs you are missing right now\nEvery trade is who are missing from drywall are still plumbers to office staff in the construction industry if you talk to any company they are looking for help and they can't find it ended up what's\nWhat some of the side effects what happens as a result of not having enough workers\nFrom my general contractors prospect of the homes that used to take us three to four months to build now they're taking six to eight months\nAnd I'm sure that you have to be higher than\nThey do they have to we have to recover that calls but you still you don't cover the full cost materials have gone up the last\nHurricanes absolutely Leno send us emails several times a day of those looking from Mary in Panama City to all these places meeting their homes to be rebuilt or repaired and you know I'm thinking to myself week we struggled day to day\nTo keep up with what we have had prior to this storm who I mean physically I mean there's a new housing new has just struggling with balancing act balancing how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo in order to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who've been hurt by Michael\nThe lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of a equipment a lack of rivers and a lot of unlicensed activity\nWhat else do workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe raise salaries mark maybe increased benefits\nIf there is not enough plumbers in town or not enough electricians in town to do the amount of work than when they did the jobs they raise their price because they know there's no one else to come in to take the work or if\nMark has his paint are coming and I know he's coming to Mars job and I look at him and I said listen here you know how about a few extra hundred bucks to come by assuming you Patti mark in the back as you're saying that tell us a small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nThat's neat and training is one thing but you're talking about stealing you can thinking oh we are ... you talked about what happened because of the recession a huge blow but then you have this you know slow steady blow\nThat has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're nodding Marcus are impacting the building industry\nThey are if you look at a lot of the trades they are immigrants I Believe the hurricane Michael the damage done over there if we did not have workers from other countries that were just would not get done so where do you do what\nWe're doing through education and bringing our younger kids and introducing them in the construction for decades we've taught them it's got to be called just got to because it's got to be college and you know there's a vast majority of aid don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them\nAnd we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contractors in the way over here and and these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and that's climbing so at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college\nThen they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through\nA future builders America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school and they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field and making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but but not to lead immigration just yet\nIf you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you're telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are the on the job before anybody else they're working hard there stay until sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\n... are you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and one thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area or in a really bad place because their homes or go on their place of business might be gone the shop the ad is gone it's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is what\nElse would change this equation\nWe see a movie recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools we spent many years not exposing young people to that type work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college\nAnd sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement and kind of making it more enticing what how else to get\nTheir revert back to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisory Rosen your you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies\nDouble triple that one more thing as a stigma that's what the big talk was ready to the last\nThirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hardly you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming fees and the storms that are increasingly violent you\nWorry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have a building will\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe\nOther states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City in Mexico beach the structures that survived we're not that much different than what we're building right here in Tallahassee they're just good quality I'll let\nYou go back to your question no if it's global warming while I'm not sure what you're referring to with our state and what do I say he is warming and and you know\nThis has been going on this weekend we went down to care about it and get to explore the shipwreck\nFrom Eighteen Ninety nine there were I reveal because of the storm but\nFrom eight to nine honors category you know what are they didn't write him back then but the damage was very similar to this wiped out of the city ... so do I it's just you don't\nBelieve the recent report from the government that you know we got even less time than we thought maybe ten years instead of twenty\nAbsolutely no nope I Believe it's cyclical you're a builder absolutely or twenty five years I\nI Do believe we do affects the environment with what we do and what we build an area full of asphalt is hotter than an area full of grass and trees there's no doubt no doubt about that\nUm but I also believe it's cyclical more than that I think that we can make the right decisions and build the right way and build strong homes and it doesn't matter what's coming\n\nFunding for

D team explosive ordnance disposal or the bomb squad team also responded\nThere today the circumstances about what have what's taking place are a little bit unclear but what was the case in the CNN bomb which CNN has posted a picture of is that it was addressed to someone at CNN with the return address of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and so if whoever is behind this\nSent a bomb to someone else potentially another target and it didn't have the right addressing the postal service returned it to Debbie Wasserman Schultz has office thinking that's where it had originated not knowing that it contained a potential\nI'm suspicious device that could be why it ended up there so she might have been the target someone else might have been the target and that's kind of\nHow this package wound up in this case in sunrise Florida\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout stars of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single payer health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not do\nAnd sort of states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs and others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now a Republican Senate refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissent has said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee\nWhich is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in this day we were traveling in a young African American who was also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's in\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five you're low in our crime rate\nThe missile defenses described a community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognized that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it\nAnd what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high law lists uh you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality\nI Want to ask you about President Trump you know in your debate with Ron descent as you said he was just do it for the president you may know both about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is without acts of leadership\nWell an absence of leadership as you as you put it ... times polling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others well\nThe state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nAh I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes\nAround making fun of handicapped individuals referring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe it's completely inappropriate behavior\nAnd Mr ... as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA race is Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society and it kind of a community or where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran just answered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ... and how all this money on many for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with a check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail\nGovernor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama's stimulus money as much as I disagree with the conduct\nAnd the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Florida two point eight billion dollars\nI'm gonna take that money and I'm a put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott Knight who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day\nOn the phone talk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to sell reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nOpponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his\nSee someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer and where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were\nContributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new Hershey every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor of Tallahassee democratic a gubernatorial candidate here in Florida ... thanks so much for speaking to us of course to take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Guillaume his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum his brother now the textbook Corey reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGuild says his brother handed in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it here so they told us in our conversation tell us about the FBI investigation according\nTo New York times and just going to ... there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days in in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to men who identified themselves as out of town developers they want to invest\nIn property they turned out to be FBI\nThey told you that you are not their target but before you knew they were you made to personal trips with your old friend Adam Cory went to Costa Rica there's questions about whether or not you and your wife paid your share of a home there you say you did\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Robyn Young it to be FSU in Tallahassee, Florida today early voting is underway here as usual the state has some exciting races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between the Democrats Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing [noise]\nHe is a Democrat\nI'm a Republican somebody wrote in\nGermany or agree with\nYou and your\nWe always make the situation\nThat Wendy of Alaska in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel a Jake Bernstein an Alexander Trujillo healthcare President Trump can the sitting governor or the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson as luckily not to let convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and Ricky Acevedo an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami high Enrique Hi Robyn\nI'm getting closer to you I'm In your state I'm Glad [laughter] and we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin from Europe well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are Hamilton I mean Hamilton makes it this race and his share of a vacation that uh the couples friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent and a and a U.S an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text\nIn which a Gillum friend a lobbyist told him about this Hamilton ticket or that the developer had for them Gillum wrists\nThere are paid for that ticket is is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida that or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly the dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh\nDishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive I'm a rich here at this answers on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president and keep people in the administration Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources which has been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government Andrew\nGillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for 'em but I don't think he's got to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd lines of how he's President Trump laying out and say well\nI mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying uh\nNo I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being the sand is was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results the Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell and make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because of passing it also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say I'm documented immigrants making their way you know ...\nWell not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nIt puts that the the issue of immigration front and center which you already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention this carbon has had in the last couple of days and that he will have a in the run up to the midterm election\nOr will see that on a ... depending on the turnout both parties I think it really is a a turnout election\nWell and not to be clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that and it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last candidate and that may got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nOr were except in into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nAnd you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr Trump won the state in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans or many of them who are already in Florida before Monday about all the ... Maria over the Puerto Ricans I have seen a coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor's race in ... in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas I Want to\nIt shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson Andrew Gillum\nWill kill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise] Sara Nelson voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for slope after telling a lie because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but\nWho's on the edge here and I especially with the hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge here yeah I I mean\nAre you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had Nelson's lead a at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently political\nUm you know I think Rick Scott being the governor he he had the advantage invisibility and the response to hurricane Michael but Senator Bill Nelson the I think to his credit he visited emergency operations centers in Bay county here in Tallahassee\nVisited rural counties and raise concerns about their their abilities to recover um so yeah I don't I don't think that the hurricane response gave a Scott much of a discernible boost Nelson is holding a lead\nRight now but uh that's in line daily here WFSU Enrique Acevedo anchor for Univision there in Miami or we will continue to watch what's always fascinating politicking for thanks for helping us do that guy's fake is if you're [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from ... simulates somewhere accelerating the pace of engineering and science learn more and I'm ...

amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in a case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibilities to lead the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland nice even person I'm explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of tightening the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration\nAnd to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course one of these do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis picky queens\nUm all part of a you could say a liberal bloc of responsible\nFor many this course for three decisions is the fourth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues\nAnd that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders and to this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nWell this is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today Ron sent is a spokesperson warned and he's the Republican or that or the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups to pick 'em these activists judges that you just referred to hell is is that factoring into that campaign\nWell it's certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raise and to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make\nThe way you know you're right because we've been asking people on the street you know he's got this big decision you know you've got to speak what they they do a lot of people don't know about it\nA lot of people don't know about it and it's been flying under the radar for years you know this has been a conversation at a question that has gone back really for decades um we had the first attempt to do this and twenty fourteen through a constitutional amendment that would have given the power to basically Governor Scott in that failed so this is not the first time but I\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W. B. U. R. Boston with a program is produced and your NPR station\nFrom college mine where consultants work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards Morris College vine dot com\nAnd Geico offering motorcycle at Harvey insurance more information available and motorcycle an RV insurance that guy go dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nHow's the framed outside Tallahassee a common occurrence here but a recent survey by the associated general contractors of America showed that eight out of ten building firms in the U.S can't find labor and in Florida it's even worse and that was before hurricane Michael flattened entire town [noise]\nThis week we had an out to a building side to meet up with members of the Tallahassee builders association Lynn Edwards is executive officer\nDoug Barton is the current president my Catholic the incoming president we started with Doug so when it comes to work is just give me that some of the problem that you're seeing and getting workers here\nIn two thousand seven recession we lost fifty percent of our industry and they have not returned they went and found other work so as things have picked back up we're still working with half our workforce\nA lot of people left the industry and then I'm Mark you're left with people who might have aged out of the industry retired\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact our average aged framing contractor is fifty seven years old\nSo can you give me the kinds of jobs you are missing right now\nEvery trade is who are missing from drywall are still plumbers to offer stuff in the construction industry if you talk to any company they are looking for help and they can't find it\nEnded up what's what some of the side effects what happened as a result of not having enough workers\nFor my general contractors perspective the homes that used to take a three to four months to build now they're taking six to eight months\nAnd I'm sure that your bits have to be higher than\nThey do have to we have to recover that calls but you still you don't cover the full cost materials have gone up the last three years probably thirty percent\nAre you worried about materials coming up even more about ...\nTariffs and hurricanes absolutely\nLeno send us emails several times a day of those looking from Mary in Panama City to all these places needing their homes to be rebuilt or repaired and I'm thinking to myself we we struggle day to day\nTo keep up with what we have had prior to the storm we I mean physically I mean the new housing new has just struggling with balancing act balancing it how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo than I Want to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who've been hurt by Michael\nThe lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of a equipment a lack of rivers and a lot of um license activity\nWhat else do workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe race out\nIn town to do the amount of work than when they ... the jobs they raised their price because they know there is no one else to come in to take the work or if\nMark has his paint are coming and I know he's coming to Mars job and I look at him I said listen here you know how about a few extra hundred bucks to come by and say we first\nPatti mark in the back as you're saying that [laughter]\nTallahassee small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nThat's neat and training is one thing that you're talking about stealing you can thinking oh we are competing you talked about what happened because of the session a huge blow the thing you have this you know slow steady blow\nThat has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're nodding markers are impacting the building and see\nThey are if you look at a lot of the trades they are immigrants I Believe the hurricane Michael the damage done over there if we did not have workers from other countries that were just would not get done so where do you do what\nWe're doing through education and bringing our younger kids and introducing them in the construction for decades we tell them it's got to be college has got to because it's got to be college and you know there's a vast majority of aid don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them\nAnd we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract isn't the way over here and then these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and that's climbing\nSo at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and for many on people the college just the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through a future builders America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school\nYou know they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read the average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but not to lead immigration just yet if you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot\nNecessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard\nWorkers often times the immigrants are the on the job before anybody else they're working hard they're staying till sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\nMy eye you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and\nOne thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because\nTheir homes are beyond their place of business might be gone the shop that he had he was gone it's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is\nWhat else would change this equation we see a move recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools\nWe spent many years not exposing young people to that\nType work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college the guys right here standing there doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nOr does she think there'd be some sort of government involvement in that kind of making it more enticing what how else to get their revert\nBack to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisor heroes and you're you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies\nDoubled tripled that one more thing as a stigma that's what the big talk was the last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big Harley you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming fees and the storms that are in ...\nAnd I have a building well no I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe\nOther states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City in Mexico beach the structures that survived we're not that much different than what we're building right here in Tallahassee they're just good quality I'll let\nYou go back to your question no this it's global warming and I'm not sure what you're referring to with our state and what do I see it\nAs he is warming and and you know\nThis has been going on this weekend we went down to care about it and get to explore the shipwreck from Eighteen Ninety nine they were I reveal because of the storm but from eight to nine honors category you know what are they didn't write them back then but the damage was very similar to this wiped out of the city a care bill so do I it's\nJust you don't believe the recent report from the government that you know we got even less time than we thought maybe ten years instead of twenty\nAbsolutely no nope I Believe it's cyclical you're a builder absolutely or twenty five years I\nI Do believe we do affects the environment with what we do and what we build an area full of asphalt is hotter than an area full of grass and trees there's no doubt no doubt about that\nUm but I also believe it's cyclical more than that I think that we can make the right decisions and build the right way and build strong homes and it doesn't matter what's
