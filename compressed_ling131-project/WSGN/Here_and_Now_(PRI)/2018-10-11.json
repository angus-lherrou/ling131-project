PCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jeremy and when you listen there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but there will dressed but they're homeless\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of sinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on a house for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain\nAbout street homelessness you know they associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nLet me give you an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county and next to city hall in Santa Ana so you know people saw this every day when they walked past it I Can't ... has since been cleared that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis sleeping in parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse than if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does who salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until ...\nAnd that continues today and there's a lawsuit in orange county uh currently before a federal judge in California tell us briefly about that\nIn this case came about in orange county officials thought to clear out a very large homeless and count man I'm up to possibly Fifteen hundred people that had been growing for many years along a flood control channel kind of right smack in the middle of the county\nAnd advocates sued based on a federal legal precedent which says law enforcement can't take it people for sleeping outside in public places if there's no realistic alternative for them\nOr you know there's not enough shelter states basically ah Orange County officials ended up giving thirty day motel vouchers to about seven hundred people\nAnd then from their work to get them into shelter and more permanent housing and we don't actually know how successful those efforts were because they haven't really kept track but the case really forced the county and cities in orange county to get serious about opening more sheltered there are several new ones expected to come in line by the end of the year and and the judge is watching closely\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Congress in orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in this traditionally conservative county but President Trump's approval rating is low here creating an opening for Democrats in the thirty ninth district ed Royce is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him is young Kim one of his staffers\nAnd what ended that shaped throughout the entire thirty ninth congressional district as a congressional staff fitness at community I Know these are the people that I'm running to represent that just personal to me\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American woman ever elected to Congress but Democrat Gil Cisneros a Latino and first time political candidate who bankrolled whose campaign was lottery winnings hopes to turn the district blue she\nWants to because I Want to protect the border that's one of the reasons I sort of the military was defending our nation although we don't need to do that by building a thirty billion dollar wall is probably going to end up one has done costing fifty billion dollars\nA prominent Republican is also leaving an open seat in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County in northern San Diego county after narrowly winning his last re election Daryl I say is leaving to join the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency\nHe's endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\n... ... replacement that function and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on the border\nThat state her opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike LeBron\nWhat's happening uh with uh the Republican Party in with Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all you know my travels throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay the rent\nIn the other two races incumbent Republicans are facing tough re elections in California's forty eighth district Dana Rohrabacher is fighting off Democrats were labeled him ... favorite congressman Roebuck or has advocated stronger ties with Moscow and once said ... muscles were just unbelievable\nYeah my constituents want us to work with Russia where we can an American people want us to work where we go rather than this unrelenting hostility and push towards you portray Russia and the United states in conflict\nHardly route hopes to become the first Democrat ever to win the forty eight [noise] and you know what\nWe are going to not flip the forty district but we are going to wash across this country for all of America [noise]\nAnd in the forty fifth district Republican Mimi Walters is seeking her third term\nI think that the American public has seen what Congress has accomplished look at more people today has a money and more money in their pocket and jobs are being created a we have higher wages\nWalters opponent Democrat Katie Porter towns endorsements from progressive senators calmly Harris and Elizabeth Warren her former professor\nWe're multinational corporations in this country that before this tax bill we're paying zero and my opponent Mimi Walters voting for this tax now which is gonna fall particularly heavily on families in her own distracting the forty fifth district in orange county\nOrange County went for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen the first time that a Democrat won the county since FDR but that doesn't mean it's turning blue for good Jody ... is a political science professor at fortune college in orange county\nSays she thinks first of all we're still a Republican county ah we're becoming last Republican as old white guys die and as the young people are much more diverse um Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now\nSo a number of people who didn't like\nRepublicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger ah and they had that experience of an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans want it\nSo I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country had an ...\nWhat are the Orange County think of President Obama\nCertainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him pretty uh vehemently uh but um [noise] you know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary\nSo what are Republicans hoping to do in this upcoming election\nSo Republicans are hoping to hold on\nYou know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump it's turnout and its taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and I'm now I guess I've got an ad the Kavanaugh factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think polls are really over estimating the Democrats' chances of getting all\nFor what are the Democrats need to do this to remember\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way um I think the story of two thousand in Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand in Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before not want the Republicans have all held elected office or are holding elected office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust\nAnd right now Orange County [noise] I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from when they have this opportunity [laughter]\nMay not have a farm team but President Obama feel so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that was before the fight in Washington over the confirmation battle for now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOutside of shopping center in Huntington Beach Orange County voted Laurie he'd told us She's been trying to oust Republican\nNegative opinion that is influencing my vote by vote so already my vote prior to [noise]\nMine's may not be changed but ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out\nParticularly women who were energized and galvanized him so I think turnout is going to be really hot because of that I don't know on the other side I don't know if Republicans who feel like the process was unfair to have an ... I don't know if there'll be galvanize to how to see not as much\nA recent poll by Berkley I. G. S. shows Orange County Democrats tied with or beating their Republican opponents sometimes by wide margins although in orange county a quarter of all voters have no party preference here's Richard master\nI'm not voting party line vote for whoever we represent the people the politicians not policy not control [noise] lower taxes and you want to earn money we worked for money you want to keep our money\nThere are also people like Greg diamond who doesn't know who represents him in Congress\nOr when you have to read up on about it before I can really say too much\nPolitical scientist Jody Ball most says many voters may not know the candidates' names\nYeah I think there's a lot of party affiliation that they're going to go on\nDo you think that part of that though is that things are\nPretty good in California right now and you pay more attention to who you're voting for when things are not good then when things are fine when you're good we got it and you got a job you you know you're okay\nYes no absolutely think that I think that you know part of low voter turnout is satisfaction that people are not a you know roaming the streets with pitchforks and ... and and trying to get big changes\nBowman says there is one area where many Orange County residents are not satisfied and that's on the issue of gas prices which are hovering around four dollars a gallon there is a question on the ballot next month across the state of Alaska voters if they want to repeal the state's new gas tax and vehicle fees\nBowman says that could awake in orange county anti tax Republican voters and make the road to a house to take over more difficult for Democrats [noise]\nYou know and I always feel like I'm going to learn something so it's not wasted time in such an easy way to learn things and basically you're getting a gift\nAnd kind of your turn to give back call one eight hundred for for for nine to foresee or go to the gym dot O.

thank you so much\nFor me beyond WVU are I'm Out in young I'm Jeremy ... is here and now the devastation left by what was hurricane Michael he's becoming more clear today the storm has killed at least two people\nA man in Florida and an eleven year old girl in Georgia and for some the danger is not over here's FEMA administrator Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety uh and making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and pushing through and doing damage assessments to make sure that we fully understand where we need to coordinate our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Huffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nA Jeremy Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to South Carolina this morning and over the next few hours from the heaviest rain from this will be near the Raleigh Durham area Fayetteville Greenville North Carolina the center that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm in likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states\nWith wins in the forty to fifty miles per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nWell the heaviest range from this thankfully is a a little more located further inland end of the mid state of upstate region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country\nBut it is moving quickly uh so Jeremy that it's going to mitigate the flood rest they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their ... a week or so ago from Florence\nHave come back down they may come back up a a bad but we're avoiding an extreme event in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWe have to watch out for tornadoes there's a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe\nAnd that risk will continue up into uh uh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this do should stay just offshore but I certainly of this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York and a massive\nFifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this is the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season work conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore\nUm and it's one of these circumstances are Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase as it approached land and we've had several hurricanes and the last decade that have weakened as they approached land a reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they did hold up in terms of the forecasts of of where it hit and the impact that it had\nWell just like Florence the track forecast when the hurricane center was really spot on here and that is that's also a reminder that the track forecast have improved remarkably over the decades\nAbsolutely and you're listening to here and now presently a and coming up in a couple of hours a little less than two hours now actually at three o'clock\nWith your host Jeanine Pierre you'll be listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR in ... and that's a these are both programs that many of our listeners who become members say they depend on\nA everyday to keep them up to speed with what's going on in right here in this country and around the world of course during MORNING EDITION and all things considered you have great local news reporting from our staff here at WBAI ... as well we hope to do more of that in the future and your dollars\nCould be the way that could be the thing that would allow us to do that\nGive now why don't you WBAI ... dot org eight hundred for for for nine two four six and we do thank you so much for your gift\nIn California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act it's also known as the sanctuary law and has drawn lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alamos which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union was telling me to city manager Troy Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal from our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right\nActually going and challenging us on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a list I Want me to sit in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait in turn to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually you know with my wife is an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California have sided with Los Alamos in defying the state law\nMarches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high he says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be that it should be a nonpartisan issue and it's a public safety issue it just ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be we're we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nSeveral interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or that we're talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\n... says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied been a few days is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people\nThe city of Santana has about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so are the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our residents\nThat they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the city is here to serve them well we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this\nUm Idaho back my uh laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city of selling me just to take the position that they did\nOther than to send a political message they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that\nWe've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nThe he\nIs a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land he often times talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal should be hounded ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time however if you're only crime quote unquote\nSurvive being able to provide for your family that's not something that I see that uh\nThe city should be looking to arrest somebody for so what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Balanchine\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is and it's not certainly will we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um we responded ... where's Wanda criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities\nUm are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law uh we do not and so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here\nUm they have their mandate to enforce federal law on that and they do that so\nUm the other pieces it has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are the common right\nSo um the ideas to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks to call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administrative Bush Obama and now Trump when there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues\nHere undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants to about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place at the Tehran\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates who ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we release them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community less safe first a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that to happen\nJoel's criminals in our care who ice a place to detain are on that we could not\nReturned dies they released back to the community one hundred and forty of those have already been re arrested for new crimes for for attempted murder\nComes from the listeners have W.

Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters to approve of President Trump or so I mean do you want do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat look it's a it's\nA bit of an attitude that's for sure [noise] uh my values on my values and my values as the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education my mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so\nThe leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage to the heights of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and also the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo do carbonation agreed um my values have always been for working families in California and that's who I Am I'm my goal is to be a new voice for ah California's in Washington DC and\nUh it's a it's an interesting attitude that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice it's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if you become the senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this is Amanda was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity to our values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Case it could say even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nI'm either Democrat and I'd be disappointed but I'd get over and a couple of weeks and try to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country forward together\nUm within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that identified from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can allow one ... ration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity or scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of gross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner\nA Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated do you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a all politics I don't support the investigation of Senator Dianne Feinstein but I Would have taken a different approach to bring cabin on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to his confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nSenator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man a new partisan political operative to hit the Senate floor for confirmation and I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's\nWill undo a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights a voting rights are environmental laws so [noise] uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked\nWhat can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a centers Richard Blumenthal 'em and um [noise]\nUh the senator from Minnesota uh be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously a delay tactic and\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee would have programmed with my colleagues and and it didn't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed and they I think a demonstrated a lack of leadership on on behalf of the senior senator from California\nState you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five Senate or find say eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate that she cannot well\nLet me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse and who are largest economy in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the site lights and I think what California wants\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the existential threat that is before us climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children are and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country\nYet we don't have that leadership or from California in Washington D. C. especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate so that seniority has not been working for California I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies the White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity too\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country um I think that comedy um and this bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game or in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine or workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws\nAre I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for the values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday\nDo you think the Democrats should try to impeach President Trump's if the Democrats take back the house in ...\nWell I've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a in a pinch Schmitz of uh the current president's um\nI have not a a bin ... dissuaded or for the position of taken it is not a partisan position of chicken I don't think Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ship for political purposes or this is based on a legalities\nAnd being the commander chief ... the chief executive officer of the most powerful position in the world I think there's sufficient evidence uh for the members of Congress are regardless of who controls are either chamber to move forward with impeachment know obviously\nIt's clear that the Republicans don't have the courage to move forward and do the right thing but if the uh the house has taken over by Democrats are I Believe strongly that they should move forward with a impeachment which do you like better LA or San Francisco I Love them both\nAnd listen to something I hear a lot of people will say it's on my radio every time I'm In the car and that's what a sue sue Meek so wrote us or wherever contribution or gift thank you very much sue from trust full\nThat's wonderful um will take care of a little bit of a FCC housekeeping as at work to remind you that you are listening to public radio for the heart of Alabama and this is your NPR station\nNinety point three WB H M Birmingham and one oh four point five FM in Fort Paine I'm listening grand with Philip ... thank you so much for all the gift you've given us this hour toward that two thousand dollar co\nWBAI ... dot org eight hundred for for for nine two four six to show your support\nFrom NPR News in Washington I'm neuron hundreds of thousands of homes and\nWell to be patient from member station W.

I'm Wondering if we don't have the list of ... what do we do\nI'm not able to extreme for them suffer cognitive will think of what can I Do to improve my life because being homeless is like being dead\nAnd why you're not you're not there you know emotionally you affected but they need to check them you'll run out the diagnosis on them you know that look it's not a good thing to be out there because the environment is not friendly when the police are not friendly\nSo what's the plan what's next for both of you\nKnow I think I'm like I told you we are professionals west sticking to that we believe that um we have a low to hope for as a medical technologist on as in most other low to the United states from what I've seen\nWith other low trough on them all we need a mix to a duo we need to do in terms of gets let's get this ... billion in us history program in ... women would do that\nAnd um we are able to make it then I think a Web which go from there of course you know being homeless you cannot do that but I'm happy for the buck to a World War two could take it all is aimed for those who but to concentrate on read a study hard because it's really hard is a different thing from where we came with from our country to practice is absolutely different so\nI think I'm not as a way forward on that as a ... full of furloughs\nSo six months from now if I was to talk to both of you what will you be doing\nI if I had been in a\nHospital setting off have private sector um patches and as Iran\nI Believe and I pray scotch and me and my husband to processing as medical technologies as they call it the air and and we have in the horn permanent housing and being able to gain back to the society I think\nI'm also knew your color for the butter wonderful all states I'm a bit to rise to go on on a ride my professionalism\nIf I've been to a place like Maryland I well I've been into special session now because of the need is do you want to see if you're qualified to practice neither neither state even with the ... the woman you are qualified to Judaism you're going to be absorbed in by any organization why what was called training on the job it is for you to move\nOn but in California yet you didn't do that you cannot do that you have to ... when you're ... you're going into the practice so I'm I've been able to her as the show to do that I think I'm I Am living within the next six months to Colombia I think we should be able to do\nLet's bring in ... rip logo who is a reporter who's been covering homelessness for K. PCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jeremy and when you listen to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but there will dressed but their homes\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on house for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain\nAbout street homelessness you know the associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nLet me give you an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county and next to city hall in Santa Ana so you know people saw this every day when they walked past it on ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis sleeping in parks are asking for money on sidewalks\nAnd is it getting worse and if so why [noise]\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does who salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nA there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and housing for homeless people and that continues today\nAnd there's a lawsuit in orange county uh currently before a federal judge in California tell us briefly about that\nIn this case came about when Orange County officials thought to clear out a very large homeless encampment I'm up to possibly Fifteen hundred people that had been growing for many years along a flood control channel kinda right smack in the middle of the county\nAnd advocates sued based on a federal legal precedent which says law enforcement can't take it people for sleeping outside in public places if there is no realistic alternative for them\nOr you know if there's not enough shelter space basically ah Orange County officials ended up giving thirty day motel vouchers to about seven hundred people and then from their work to get them into shelter and more permanent housing and we don't actually know how successful those efforts were because they haven't really\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and from your NPR station\nFrom college wind where consultants work with

Democrats are hoping to flip some house seats that they'll need to take control of Congress in orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in this traditionally conservative county but President Trump's approval rating is low here creating an opening for Democrats in the thirty ninth district ed Royce is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him is young Kim one of his staffers\nAnd wake and investigate throughout the entire thirty ninth congressional debt stay at the congressional staff they said that community I now these are the people that I'm running to represent this is personal to me\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American woman ever elected to Congress but Democrat Gil Cisneros a Latino and first time political candidate who bankrolled his campaign with lottery winnings hopes to turn the district blue she\nWants to protect I Want to protect the border that's one of the reasons I sort of the military was defending our nation but we don't need to do that by building a thirty billion dollar wall is probably going to end up one has done causing fifty billion dollars\nA prominent Republican is also leaving an open seat in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County in northern San Diego county after narrowly winning his last re election Daryl I sent is leaving the joined the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency\nHe's endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\nWell unless for kind of ... kind of instant replay in to function and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on state board of equalization and very very minority position because I'm a Republican and very very democratic state\nHer opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike LeBron\nWhat's happening uh with uh the Republican Party in with Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all as a you know my travels throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay the rent in\nThe other two races incumbent Republicans are facing tough re elections in California's forty eighth district Dana Rohrabacher is fighting off Democrats were labeled improvements favorite congressman Roebuck or has advocated stronger ties with Moscow and once said putting his muscles were just unbelievable\nYeah my constituents want us to work with Russia where we can and American people want to stress\nIt's in conflict hardly router hopes to become the first Democrat ever to win the forty eight [noise] and you know what\nWe are going to flip the forty eighth district but we are going to wash across this country for all of America [noise]\nAnd in the forty fifth district Republican Mimi Walters is seeking her third term\nI think that the American public has seen what Congress has accomplished look at more people today has money more money in their pocket um jobs are being created a we have higher wages\nWalters opponent Democrat Katie Porter touts endorsements from progressive senators come all the Harris and Elizabeth Warren her former professor\nReal multinational corporations in this country that before this tax bill we're paying zero and my opponent Mimi Walters voted for this tax bill which is gonna fall particularly heavily on families in her own district and the forty fifth district in orange county\nOrange County went for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen the first time that a Democrat won the county since FDR but that doesn't mean it's turning blue for good Jody ... is a political science professor at fortune college in orange county\nSince she things first of all we're still are Republican county ah we're becoming laughs Republican as old white guys die and as the young people are much more diverse um Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now [noise]\nSo a number of people who didn't like him have come around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger\nAh and they had had that experience and an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans wanted\nSo I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't ...\nWhat are the Orange County think President Obama\n[noise] um so certainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him pretty uh vehemently ah but um [noise] you know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary\nSo what are Republicans hoping to do in this upcoming election certain public into your house\nTaxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and and now I guess I've got to add the ... factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think the polls are really over estimating the Democrats' chances of getting all for what are the Democrats need to do this November\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way um I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back\nI think two thousand and Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat uh they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before not on the Republicans have all held elected office or are holding elected office so they kind of experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust\nAnd right now Orange County [noise] I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from when they have this opportunity [laughter]\nDemocrats may not have a farm team but President Obama feel so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that was before the fight in Washington over the confirmation battle for now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOutside of shopping center in Huntington Beach Orange County voted Laurie he'd told us She's been trying to oust Republican members of Congress here for years way before Kevin I was in the picture\nBy opinion about the negative opinion but not influencing my vote by vote the so already my votes prior to [noise]\nMine's may not be changed but ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out\nParticularly women who were energized and galvanized him so I think turnout is going to be really hot because of that I don't know on the other side I don't know if Republicans who feel like the process was unfair to cabinet I don't know if there'll be galvanized to how to see not as much\nA recent poll by Berkley I. G. S. shows Orange County Democrats tied with or beating their Republican opponents sometimes by wide margins although in orange county a quarter of all voters have no party preference here's Richard master\nAlthough she cannot control lower taxes and you want to earn money we worked for money you want to keep our money\nThere are also people like Greg diamond who doesn't know who represents him in Congress\nAre gonna have to read up on about it before I can really say too much political\nScientist Jody Ball most says many voters may not know the candidates' names\nYeah I think there's a lot of party affiliation that they're going to go on\nDo you think that part of that though is that things are\nPretty good in California right now and you pay more attention to who you're voting for when things are not good and then when things are fine when you're good we gotta you gotta job you you know in New York ...\nYes no absolutely think that I think that you know part of low voter turnout is satisfaction that people are not a you know roaming the streets with pitchforks and ...\nAnd and trying to get big changes\nBowman says there is one area where many Orange County residents are not satisfied and that's on the issue of gas prices which are hovering around four dollars a gallon there is a question on the ballot next month across the state that will ask voters if they want to repeal the state's new gas tax and vehicle fees\nBomber says that could awake in orange county's anti tax Republican voters and make the road to a house to take over more difficult for Democrats [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "11"}
