voters as they cast their ballots on October first twenty Seventeen\nJoining us now is the BBC's ... he's in a busy square in downtown Barcelona where there was a moment of silence at noon local time to mark the anniversary of that vote a gab and tell us more about what's happening there today\nWell the thing what what we're seeing if it has become sort of the most effective tools of independence movement which is a physical numbers that the colors on the streets says that the flags fiesta allowed at a flag of independence and there are people who own around me\nHundreds of mainly young independence activists who have been sleeping outside the capital on politics [laughter]\nAmong the regional government until they declare independence so that could be here for some\nTime well let's hear from one of the activists that you spoke with this is a man named Roger Espanol who was shot by police in the eyes he was actually he was blinded by a rubber bullet last October first and you asked him what has been achieved by the referendum the first step\nWas the first of all I'm sure we're gonna make it yes even if we're going to have the political power in our\nSite gabbing to these protestors believe they still have a shot at independence\nSome of them do one of the grassroots group called a CD onto the campaign for Democratic Republic of this morning touch 'em some of the major ... routines about surviving a stop to all the traffic that they managed to break into the train stations to a high speed train running from\nOne of the major cities to fall so you know they are active in the new regional presidents and uncle Kim ...\nHas said today that ... activity is working keep pushing it so I think this will be seen as provoke us have certainly by the main government in Spain you're down saying\nThe socialist government and the prime minister ... there is no chance of ever a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to\nThe spokesperson for the cat on separate discussion here\nAnd join the PKK he said to me categorically no and they will continue he said working on accept disobedience and like the illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice now he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something\nWell you know we should point out that their recent polls that say that people in the region are split on the issue so there are many people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those who\nDo not um how how divided here yeah Catalonia [noise]\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because it in the in the years since we had a really pivotal moment the polls hasn't changed it's divided fifty fifty and I think that the the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts to look at the situation now they believe\nWon't thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is certainly you nailed it divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again on the streets\nBut the BBC's Kevin ... speaking with us from the streets of downtown\nMm\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm us up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spend a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire started to fire but you want to hear my first step\nYeah I use a walk a walk the ideal shape for\nHolding the oil knows flattering it's got the high sides you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I had my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I had about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see\nIt's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred and I'm always adjusting to keep it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burnt chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk that fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken and American so I can listen to that crunch All right good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter] um what I did was I took\nA whole chicken I cut it into pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good butter milk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender arises chicken it at some of that is ... flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and here's another ... OK okay if you're ...\nPress pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not an over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of honey here and some lemon so I didn't do so you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the ... of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken fried chicken and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting has really brings out the sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle down a kind of pulls it out that's\nA really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you\nCan fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying\n's okay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly\nThis is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw is ginger little catch up sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nOh so you fry it you call it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for Chris ... is it yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispness\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger\nAnd I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and by the way I sent\nWell and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans I've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go in his fried chicken back in the day so there's a lot of his\nA chicken and what ... the big takeaway is that it's eaten all over the world but I did talk to Michael ... he is the author of the cooking gene\nWhich won some James Beard awards he said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co-opted time and time again\nAnd he goes on to talk about how it's southern and the soul identities come right out of this collision\nOf all the influences that make up the fried chicken that we eat in this country that we saw a door okay there's one more thing in front of me Cathy and this is buffalo chicken we eat is buffalo chicken wings of course originally came from buffalo\nWhom\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and homemade visor matching homeowners with home

areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen and ... the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the districts trying to figure all this out Carly welcome\nYeah thank you for having me\nThose numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing their peers county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\nYeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental units\nRentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened\nUm there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath\nThem and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYou you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to the address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment that they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers are experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so we're going to help her unit\n[noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to have the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide 'em funding and donations\nI Believe a vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we send food packs home with every homeless students on friday so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday\nWe have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here and it's wonderful\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's got it's not it's not the government coming in to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team baffle it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you well know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nAnd their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had\nNo self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHe's probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy\nSo after a couple meetings with them over the next week um I had discovered they love the animals so it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian it took took the young man under his wings and started showing them the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and help on tearing clean the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have hope in a dream after high school and that's\nAll I can offer for the students as giving them the hope and the dream that they can be somebody after high school other than what they've experienced\nCarly ... a family resource coordinated with the ... school district and peers county Washington a which has been

I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't just Davis because I was doing very well audience fun people from close circuit television and uh I didn't have a clue ... until that point\nReally so and and and how does it work for you if you just see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIt leaves you'd be amazed last year and a lot of people from the back of the head from above who's but those are\nThe very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time I\nLook a fight sucking up into the ... if someone is lobbying Iraq style and you also have on well it's a ... put me in a room full of people and pitches last amazing that you like that I actually love it and ... just a\nIt's not a burden so in other words I see thousands of faces everyday to I wouldn't want to remember each of the details that I pick up\nIt can be a burden speak on it because you could be walking down the street and someone would ... would you they might smile she's think oh I Know that person because you recognize the face that you don't actually know them ... and then like a a don't we know you if the problem is because if you walk in the same area coughed and you'll see the fights you recognize device\nHuh do you have to commit the face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nA seem voluntary um you don't really have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face Siamese songs I recognized him years later\nAnd you didn't know this until you were working with the police as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a kid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot us to talk to the correct or did not have a clue ... everybody could do this all thought it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second ... found out what a super recognized off doing the test with ... ... that's ...\nHuh you are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning or insults very of course you were not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSo I ... I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to view and foster very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would not go look for certain people or if not with art and fought people from the footage so\nWe noticed his ... scientists and appearing mostly because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we've got some memory than if we see that person to get enough of it if the age where stop building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there is some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras\nCapturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of that evidence for you as a detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nThey know ... which I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps are pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always looking to the ... victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help solve ... fun people well what kind of cases did you crack\nA really good one was there was a male who has a one of ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out of the country of the time so all of his uh in London and I've seen a ... I mean I'm actually not just a suspect I'd never met them before about seeing a picture of them full\nSolve going around in the ... he's giving me folks details destroy swab or lost at the same and he'd been stopped several times on the police officers who had recognized him being on London's most wanted but luckily ... when we took him back for fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell us how you found them\nWe did get actual often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like did appreciate is a very unique skill\nWow Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think that she's sort of in that eats we think that super recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability we found some very small difference is in the way that they have brains function\nAnd I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going and future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nThink it's a different function is it's quite an interesting question that because people have done research on a world champion soup and memorize is who passed can count hundreds of ... something like this and when they\nSuper recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing so to streams of numbers in words and things like that so it does seem as though it's a unique skill that sees specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill that is\nNot in fact almost the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities needing to know a large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that sort of\nStrange situation as far as the sun is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associates it with\nOther aspects of object recognition has somehow change slightly to in these super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis ... the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces as well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I say with very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut with low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beats computers\nI think in the future well what the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions\nWhat are the limitations that people like Kenny have a ... a human being leads to sleep unlike you to uh we get tied fatigue there must be a limit to how\nMany images and how many people Kenny can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWas really I think an impressive about Kenny skill is his ability to rule out\nThe huge number of faces that he knows and they'll say ... to him because obviously when they're searching through CCTV footage for ... you know for I suspect Fritz ... most of the time they're actually looking at face these people then not interested in the ... super recognize that can do\nIs Josh I Know you've worked with\nAnd the forced to be tested for this skill but but what about other places do you see super recognizer is being used in this country and the FBI for example or are you noticing this getting some traction in smaller police departments around the world\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

physiology or medicine was awarded today to James Allison into Sudoku hunt joke for the discoveries on how to use the body's immune system to attack cancer Allison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform\nAt the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr posters welcome and congrats to you and your colleagues on winning a Nobel Prize this\nIs fantastic news of course for Jim for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works\nIn cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and his main insight was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments\nPeople don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associated with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolve including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result\nOf these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at Indiana or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combinations of targeted therapy immunotherapy\nAnd the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer affect\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize award really\nOpen up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter sisters the president of the universe\nWell now to Spain and the city of punting ... population eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than honking horns that's because much of the city is now car free parking spaces no traffic lights and in Ninety seven percent cut in auto traffic since Nineteen Ninety nine\nFreelance journalist Stephen virgin wrote about this he joined us on Skype from Barcelona welcome\nHigh and did they ban cars entirely and punted ada\nWell they they ban them from the initially from the historic part of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extend that to a slightly bigger\nA area which is sort of the the Eighteenth nineteenth century part of the city so the city center is calm free and then it's it's ... it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's working out very well let's say you know like most of these things that was a lot of resistance or people you know associate having cause with their\nPersonal liberty um but I spoke to last for a while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticize to even though you know this is a part of Spain where it tends to bring quite a lot and it's on the Atlantic side of spying on people tend to get into that caused whenever it's raining\nAnd also people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulances\nWell you know all all of them can get in the city and they're also taxes you know the rule was is quite straight to the mayor said to me if you want to get married and the old city the bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else walks\nWhat about businesses or are they happy with this because you would think that many people would want to drive to get to its shop or a restaurant where they want to go\nWell that was you know that was business where I was opposed to it exactly on that basis although in these old cities is very very difficult to park so the reality is in ... businesses survive better\nThan in some small towns or were you know they still allow cause a pony because it's just simply nicer to walk around the other thing is that the the the city of Sarkozy's combined this policy of banning cars were those also banning\nThe building of big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which tends to destroy small businesses within the town so\nWanted to do this well you have you know he basically said that the old city was effectively a dumb said it was a that people didn't like going now that it was full of abandoned cars that were a lot of drugs and he and within the first month of coming to office basically\nThey cleaned it up and buying cars which is you know clearly something you know he said they'd been ... you know he's been researching into those for\nSome time before he took office\nAnd I think partly because he did it swiftly was you know there was kind of a fait accompli\nWhat about CEO to admissions or what happened to pollution as a result of this\nWill pollution and according to their statistics went down within the city center by about Seventy percent or accidents went down\nA ... to ... uh to almost zero and I think in the past four or five years\nIt's been zero of either either people injured or killed so you know these are significant gains obviously you know it's also you know general game for people's health and people walk or people cycle I'm you know this is what everyone is to some extent aiming for in cities\nNow punted address a small city many people probably haven't even heard of it but there is a larger city in Spain Madrid that's actually considering doing something similar what are they thinking about in Madrid um\nMany many cities in Europe are about ... eighty thousand a hundred thousand like on the other so you know what's been done there could easily be applied in the cities in the big city like betrayed obviously it's a different story I think you know what they're aiming for is to ... by ... exclude traffic\nFrom the city center I'm part of part of what was being done it's also being done here in Barcelona it's simply make it less convenient to drive by creating more psychopaths by making it harder to park so eventually people sort of get the message that they might as well use public transport or get a bicycle\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't

hour hour and Fifteen minutes or so that a buy one senior Republican Senate stores that they think they could wrap this up could underscored that by tomorrow\nBut they can't be viewed as rushing this remember the terms of the agreement laid out by Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona on friday was that this was supposed to take a week\nNow let me get a little bit into the weeds here and this is very important and there's a procedure\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has a right to file what's called cloture that's an effort to end debate and whenever he does that consider that to be de won confirmation vote after you run through all the Senate traps would be on about day for maybe day five\nMitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest the question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete\nIs he interrupting disagreement with Jeff Flake Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they're okay with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine that's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with it that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun that's a problem that could be viewed as a violation of the agreement and you know just like got a lot of criticism from some conservatives over the weekend or who you know criticized him for saying that you know he was delaying all this\nThey wouldn't have a chance of getting the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh were it not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years\nAnd with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia\nMaybe Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota maybe get his highest fifty three days but otherwise they're stuck at forty nine so they can't move too quickly in the Senate they have to be here\nThe president says he wants what Senate leadership\nThat will be interviewed by the FBI\nAnd that's the question and you know what this Collins want what does Murkowski one that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not exactly Swiss when they tell you that something is going to happen seven days from now or six days from now usually happens in about eight or nine maybe ten\nUh the only thing I Do know is that once that clock starts to run ... once McConnell files cloture to end debate that we'll take that is a finite period about four to five days at the most\nSo we don't know and that's something that they have to have to consider and see where they are and ... did they find out any answers that raised other questions you know we're we're not privy to what they're finding out in this background and that's right

sort of the most effective tools of independence movement which is a physical numbers that the colors on the streets that that the flags fiesta allotted a flag of independence and there are people who are all around me\nUp hundreds of mainly young independence activists who have been sleeping outside the catch it on politicians saying that for the next few weeks and months they try to protect the general states have the government the regional governments until they declare independence so they could be here for some\nTime well let's hear from one of the activists that you spoke with this is a man named Roger Espanol who was shot by police in the eyes he was actually he was blinded by a rubber bullet last October first and you asked him what has been achieved by the referendum the first step\nWas the first of all do and I'm sure we're going to make it yes even if we're going to have the will power you know a site\nGabbing to these protestors believe they still have a shot at

government to the prime minister federal Sanchez there is no chance of\nEver a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to\nThe spokesperson for the ... separate his government here\nAnd join the PKK he said to me categorically no and they will continue he said working on accept disobedience\nLike be illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice now he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something\nWell you know we should point out that their recent polls that say that people in the region are split on the issue so there are many people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those who\nDo not um how how divided in Catalonia\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because you know in the in the years since we had to really pivotal moment the polls hasn't changed it's divided fifty fifty and I think that's the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts who look at the situation now they believe\nThe wrong thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is that the United states that divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again on the streets but\nTo be received Kevin ... speaking with us from the streets of downtown force alone again thanks so much for your time we do appreciate\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various food and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it isn't solved steep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire started fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk walk is the I\nI Want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a ... because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I had my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I had about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Chris go you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see it's getting close to four hundred or\nOh no no it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting to keep it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk led fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken and American so I can listen to that crunch All right good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good butter milk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender rises chicken it at some of that is ... flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course\nOf course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up\nAnd here's another track okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the press pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for a different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of money here and some lemon so I didn't know so you would yeah I don't I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken\nFried chicken and went to write the hunting isn't the hunting and Israel out this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle yeah kind of pulls it out that's a really favorite rest by the way what do you do with the left of her oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I fried\nYou got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy food is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this\nIs my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go wrong and\nSoy sauce ginger little ketchup sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nOh so you fry it you call it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for ... that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy and is\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I similar it down again the chili paste the ginger\nAnd I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think\nIt's delicious and and find a way off that well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and I was fried chicken back in the day so there's a lot of history\nLots of history and David chain did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what ... the big takeaway is that it's eaten all over the world but I did talk to Michael ... he is the author of the cooking gene\nWhich won some James Beard awards he said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co-opted time and time again\nAnd he goes on to talk about how it's southern and the soul identities come right out of this collision\nOf all the influences that make up the fried chicken that we eat in this country that we saw a door okay there's one more thing in front of me Cathy and this is buffalo chicken we eat is buffalo chicken wings of course originally came from buffalo they are traditionally fried however even though we're calling ...\nFunding for here and now

had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen and ... the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years across the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the districts trying to figure all this out Carly welcome\nYeah thank you for having me\nThose numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing their peers county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\nYeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened\nUm there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nYou are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing\nAnd they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath\nThem and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it\nI go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just\nKnow they're not responding to me and I just want to ask them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years\nYeah this is in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause a each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help her unit\n[noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city title so it's very difficult to\nHave the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide 'em funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on friday so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis that's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to come in to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help the\nBig picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely to drop out of high school and as you well know then becomes the cycle\nOf poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's\nAnd what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be I'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had\nNo self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHe's probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy\nSo after a couple meetings with them over the next week um I had discovered they loved animals so it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian that took the took the young man under his wings and started showing them the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and help on tearing clean the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have a hope and a dream after high school and that's\nAll I can offer for these students is giving them the hope and the dream that they can be somebody after high school other than what they've experienced\nCurly ... a family resource coordinated with the ... school district and peers county Washington a which has been dealing with a spike in the number of homeless kids are enrolled in their
