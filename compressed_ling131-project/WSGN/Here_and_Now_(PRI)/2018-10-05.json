Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that uh it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nUh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lotta sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think his left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times\nWhat about the idea also that this ... yet another TV network show that is going for them ... factor and bringing back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a way this could feel like a like a step too far uh some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pin up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of star was embers politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had the sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace and NBC that revive all the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lotta revivals of shows\nThat are sort of thinly veiled or revivals you know they have ... magnum PI they have ... they have mcgyver and all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill or procedural adventure stories and ... and slapped living near the show ... over it so\nUm you know those have been under the radar and the way they get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kinda phenomenon with Murphy Brown\nAnd we're familiar with the show and because the the the ... version of it I'm Still a little awkward in kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding\nNew friends said beer TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAnd again to our top story today the Senate advancing Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lobbed at Kavanaugh has prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct\nMost have changed significantly since back then but as NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go\nTo many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted of the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was\nIn Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh went centered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge to him soul searching who's making a mistake schools have already\nChanged dramatically since the eighties Paul for he says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent and respect\nIt is changing but it's still a problem on campuses\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd ordered thanks funding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

nine that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now how Mike Hi Jeremy well let's start with the number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well right as you\nMentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so yeah this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um you know a lot of companies that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people are away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\n[noise] absolutely yeah and ah you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um\nSince two thousand and ten or ... the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight\nUm and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers\nBut I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict go to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of adds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now\nUh it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet\nUm but it's by all accounts are very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages so they\nContinued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about in overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now we're back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to two into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg News thank you thanks German\nPresident Trump is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and the strong economy also came up in his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his weight into one of the most hotly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nIs supposed to be a democratic state\nI don't think\nVery big surprise [laughter]\nHow did that surprise is that the Republican\nJim how you doing wins he's facing the Democrat dance in both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nSo that district is where we turn for this week's district profile captain Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and cats in um Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nBut the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself well it's kind of ...\nRepublican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester and mean Kato which are sort of the city hubs\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty six team when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett darn and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat than the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned with Democrats and in this recent ad he built himself as an independent voice\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together accomplish incredibly great thing and that's exactly what Congress today I'm not taking over ... Lebanese are nothing and reader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently pointed that out so he's moved back to the districts are run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWill not at the Republican Jim had to door in his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington the whims of government are so certain Rosen a Trump can't pull in fact\nI'm running for Congress to help and assistance rip out the regulations Obamacare and ...\nSo Catherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's the thought on that\nWell he has done aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... during that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager and lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time\nGrace administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these lottery time\nSo those are the two candidates cats around not ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really dissed for Minnesota Senator Al Franken\nFor in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior behavior that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the the accusations we've been hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics\nAnd the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that yeah it was\nIt was an interesting point that he made and I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he\nLeft office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that and this is being set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court and whether he is taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and left we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place who's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for his heart\nMost fascinating but how is the whole cabinet debate impacting if it is this race or is it just falling along party lines\n[noise] you know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Kavanaugh we support judge Kavanaugh\nBut it was sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad\nHappens to you Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nSo many years ago we just don't think it was him because he doesn't seem like the type of person who would do that uh they called it a witch hunts they said that you know she she may be missed remembering", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "05"}
