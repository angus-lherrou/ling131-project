B. U. R. I'm Lisa Mullen's it's here and now the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change has released a briefing report it finds that humans only have about the next decade to slow down the current level of greenhouse gas emissions before there's a tipping point\nAnd parts of the earth are irreversible each changed\nScientists meeting and South Korea over the past weekend have reached a consensus that it's possible to limit a rise in global temperatures but that will require monumental changes in policy\nBrenda ... is the director of climate science for the union of Concerned Scientists spread of what is your reaction to this very dire prediction and the report\nYou captured it this is a really important report and the assignment to the scientists was to tell us what's the difference between the world warming one point five\nOr two degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels and the difference is as you said striking in dire in many instances\nSo this is a lot of scary predictions um but a lot of scary predictors are made in a lot of climate studies by different sources what makes this one different and how do you gauge um the the importance of these protections\n[noise] a lot of the scientists study talked about much larger changes by Twenty one hundred three degrees Celsius which by the way happens to be what countries have put forth in their nationally determine contributions to try to help solve this so they look at much higher temperatures this is the first report to really look at\nWhat would it be like at one point five degrees C and how ...\nIt's a lot um what what would be the consequences according to this\n[noise] was it it is a big deal because think about this the world has gone through about point eight degrees Celsius rise since the pre industrial period if we added another point six degrees Celsius to get to one point five degrees just think about how many\nUm in extreme heat wave the world has already experienced at the level of climate change we already have\nThe amount of hurricane extreme precipitation what we know is that coral reefs are one of the very vulnerable species of um eco systems that are risk at one point five degrees C\nUm and at two degrees C we the report says we could likely lose the vast majority of our coral reefs and\nOn the positive side I mean just takes a look at the negative as well but it says if the world was able to change and if it was able to get a hold of the climate change in global warming going on right now half as many people would suffer from lack of water there will be fewer deaths and illnesses\nFrom heat and smog and infectious diseases sees would rise\nA about four inches less and there will be substantially fewer heat waves and downpours and droughts\nOne author says this is a monumental task to reverse our current course but it is not impossible what do you say\nThe good news that is not impossible and and that four inches of extra sea level rise between a one point five Sea World and the to the world is worth fighting for because that's the difference in exposing an additional ten million people around the world to a restaurant sea level rise so it's really worth\nFor for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and from staples with printers printer ink on toner cartridges\nFor home in business and in store print shops for customized presentations booklets and manuals more at staples stores or staples dot com staples\nIt's here and now the conflict in Yemen is taking a terrible toll on civilians who are caught in the crossfire a civil war started there in twenty four team today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides of the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's\nTrying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran David Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee\nDavid Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and what eighty three percent of the population are in extreme public ... on the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy in five is\nThe results of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years and neither side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east of them the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by a who seek to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is it a Saudi led coalition with us support also UK other European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to topple the Yemen the control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids that are being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted the front lines of Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the port of data which is currently choked truly a by the fighting only a trickle of aid and commercial traffic is getting through\nI'm what's happening in Yemen is the ... conflict between the who the is on the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who these\nAre the right than the other side from the Saudis the lesson the u._k.\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni Shia you also have a split of in trout regional power struggle\nBut in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is this is a humanitarian catastrophe or the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death\nBut at the same time there was a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists of all ... and I says\nAnd it's a ... trait now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian meltdown but political melt down and look what does that mean it means that the humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues that\nPublic sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself or the moment is being ravaged by war that is not to the benefit of any of the signs were waging it was in fact being exploited by extremists and I think the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S and the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nA winning a whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nTo hold on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. the U. S. and the others\nWant what's their goal that goal is first of all to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand and fourteen or two and a third Lynn importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no\nQuestion about who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns but what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed a on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo says the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties\nNot obviously six in the ... because I met a Yemen these who told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of school children more than forty of them killed in ... such a state your in the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation but everything is being done to protect civilians why we I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not want to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority I\nI'm not costing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that siblings are not being\nProtected them the conduct of the war has breached the base of the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the who the side independent un inquiries have\nOtherwise the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a a crisis that now I came away saying that the willingness to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed dependent needs to be picked up because there is not the current debate to replace the failed U.N Security council resolution twenty Fifteen was something that is actually a roof map\nTo peace rather than the ... for\nIf we take the issue of 'em are refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world\nThey ... moved to a relatively benign climate you are relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut my Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year\nHow does that affect your work we'll just for the benefit of your\nAre about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh\nHistorically for the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture often children the U.S has stepped up\nAnd being a leader in what's called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees the or the U.S actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means that individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translators and things\nThat are being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who can't now starts a new life to work in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up being targeted because of ... for the U.S then not being allowed in\nEither so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the U.S\nGovernment and the great danger is that a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees\nAnd program is being strangled and this year we are having to deal with the fact that there was a historic low in the number of refugees allowed and only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year that ended on September\nThe ... the Trump administrators us into the U.S a drop in his ration is such a feeling of thirty thousand for this fiscal year which started on October\n... the first and so what we see is not just the effect on individual lives of those who would have come here there's also the fact the countries around the world is seeing that the U.S doesn't have that back let me give you an example Jordan the second closest ally of the United states in the middle east is dealing with six hundred and fifty thousand registered refugees in Syria\nThat's right we've got

and it remains one of the art world's most confounding mysteries a half billion dollars worth of art were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum in Nineteen Ninety\nThere was Thirteen pieces in all including works by Rembrandt de Gaulle Vermeer and many\nSince the highest there have been no arrests and not a piece of stolen or has been recovered WB you are in the Boston Globe was launched a podcast called last seen to investigate how and why that's the case you were reporters jak were legal in Kelly [noise]\nIn the early hours of march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety the city of Boston was still celebrating saint Patrick's Day hangovers would be widespread come to a break so would news at the city's most unusual museum had been the victim of a daring overnight robbery [noise]\nBut anything I'm Casey Kaufman and here's what's happening up priceless collection of artwork was stolen early this morning from Boston Isabella Stewart and Gardner Museum\nThere was one I Am Saturday the two men voting as uniformed policeman the security guards there like me to be investigating a disturbing\nInitial estimates put the value of the stolen works at at least two hundred million dollars hundred million dollar eighty seven year old Gardner Museum is considered one of the finest small art museums in the country\nOfficials say the museums elaborate surveillance system made no difference\nMuseum officials today said it was the largest art heist in history\nDespite the confidence of museum of visuals that the prejudice artworks will be recovered\nSee before I Witness news\nThe thieves who pulled off the greatest art heist in history had a pretty simple plant they dressed up and cop uniforms and rang the bell it was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere'd been a keg party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fake cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so he buys them into the museum\nThat guide what'd you make out that\nThey came in and they turn so I could see if I could see that they had had goes bad as they looked like up so I suppose the rest of the way\nSteve crept in any way Cabot talked about that night at an Indian restaurant in two thousand Thirteen\nThe first question was is that is who I said my partner okay got it out\nThis is the first time that former guard the line who was on duty that night with habit has ever spoken publicly about his experience\nWondering if they might just come up behind my head with a gun or the silence or and just you know do a real quickly\nIt was terrifying night and all these years later he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he still plays makes a living at it mostly in house bans on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a masters in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing to supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nAt nighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read and I could bring\nAnd I call any special training are specific instructions spend the night shift beyond the requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on all the floor during his round he did that by swiping a magnetic strapped\nHe wasn't originally on the schedule to work the night after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reported they called in sick edited told him about the carriage alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to add to watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that connection I owe this might have something to do with the alarm that went off\nOne of the uniform demand said he recognized at and asked to see his id\nHe said yeah I Do know you\nThere's a warrant out for your arrest and he told ... to stand against the wall or put his arms up he does the pat down it puts the cops on\nAnd on and just standing there with my job and going wow you know what what's going on where the written due to see really into some kind of trouble and it's still never occurred to me that they were anything but policemen\nBy stepping out and away from the desk who make Abbott's also stepped away from the still means signaling traveled to the outside world to museums panic button no sooner with Abbott against the wall and handcuffed than Randy was too\nI kept asking him over and over why are we being arrested why are we being arrested and he wouldn't answer [noise] slowed kosher on my hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape and he says this is a robbery and so then everything was fine like crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly it made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the law was going through your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise]\nUm but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them saying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief and I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they there's nothing here in this\nYou can discount across their eyes and across their mouths but only a split so they could breed than stare stare they're robbers led the guards you couldn't see anything down the basement one of the the used and other parents and cuts

and he adjusted that several times and he said I you're going to be here for a long time so I don't want the ... these to be too tight\nSo he was real column and real nice about it and he also several times said sorry to have to do this\nRandy just one of the guy to get away from him to go do what he had come to do to get out of there were you panicking um\nIt was scary and I remember feeling like I needed to prepare myself for death if that if it ended up coming to that\nWhat does that mean preparing yourself for death\nWas running music through my head a lot just feeling like I don't know what happens to us when we die it's all in history but I'm\nJust felt like my needed to be mentally\nIs there a particular piece of music that\nDefinitely I remember one of the pieces\nThe Mozart

feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story\nUm the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nSo um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen for planning\nThese across China who were planning to handouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out their plan the police in in all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rest\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them for thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is the ... well I'm ... well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because\nI'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charging them with an end in the end it was something I can too disturbing the social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was\nTo handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine\nUm well I mean among the fan on a five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse and their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the mites herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement has personally being\nUm victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree you know there will be some people who remember mostly do things a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal\nWithout ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nWell I mean in the early communist era\nHim and still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the con find moments of of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as\nI'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off relatives to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways and that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThat dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women you know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat\nThat the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing\nA particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do because these young feminists are telling other women no\nSubjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles a beautiful wife and mother um all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best child bearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um said that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's been encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year\nAnd this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government as it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories on there is a work with all the censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship which has become incredibly sophisticated\nThat these women are ... there are so imaginative that they find ways of circulating their message and getting around the censorship censorship I mean just to give one example there was one activist who I'm Wendy ...\nMo jeeze for rice and Bonnie which which is me tool in Chinese which sounds like me too\nAnd so that was one way or that they were able to gain a get around the censorship for a while um another all all the government called ... ... right but then they're continually playing this game of cat and mouse and coming up with new ways to get around the censorship could they have done this without the Internet\nFunding for here and no comes from the listeners

pretty tough subjects in her young adult fiction her debut novel centered on two girls who love for each other and put them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah affairs on as a child of parents who came to the U.S from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly white an affluent um private school as you did I I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller [laughter]\nSo [laughter] it should um give it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs little help\nHe is of mixed heritage his dad his Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um Dijon is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and he said you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was in the ... face right All right yeah so shocked on yeah and uh has sent it anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who assigned to his mother and other parents are are very upset and want to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him and allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for some\nWant to be um the poster boy for international politics right\n[laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did this thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking\nNot invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well with what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think\nMost people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window versus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of\nA little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nSo how does speech on in the book realize that to understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal\nMonologue you can tell that he is really hurting and I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know set up for yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have them have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism\nBecome exacerbated and get even more painful when you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book\nDeplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do\nTwenty of just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white lady chose your first and you don't want to be the ... well no but for all\nKids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved but I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it may be after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time [noise]\nWhat do you what's the pay for you it was just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people less\nIf you were in I mean this was a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted a conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nI Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times and how can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult\nWhich is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out Sarah ... thank you thank you so much\nOh\n[noise]\nToday the ...

consensus that it's possible to limit a rise in global temperatures but that will require monumental changes in policy\nBrenda ... is director of climate science for the union of Concerned Scientists sprint or what is your reaction to this very dire prediction and the report\nYou captured it this is a really important report and the assignment to the scientists was to tell us what's the difference between the world warming one point five\nOr two degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels and the difference is as you said striking in dire in many instances\nSo this is a lot of scary predictions um but a lot of scary predictions are made in a lot of climate studies by different sources what makes this one different and how do you gauge um the the importance of these protections\n[noise] a lot of the scientists study talked about much larger changes by Twenty one hundred three degrees Celsius which by the way happens to be what countries have put forth in their nationally determine contributions to try to help solve this so they look at much higher temperatures this is the first report to really look at\nWhat would it be like at one point five degrees C and how much effort with the world have to take to reach that goal\nSo again one point five degrees Celsius doesn't sound like a lot um what what would be the consequences according to this\n[noise] was it it is a big deal because think about this the world has gone through about point eight degrees Celsius rise since the pre industrial period if we added another point six degrees Celsius to get to one point five degrees just think about how many\nUm an extreme heat wave the world has already experienced at the level of climate change we already have\nThe amount of hurricane extreme precipitation what we know is that coral reefs are one of the very vulnerable species of um eco systems that are risk at one point five degrees C\nUm and at two degrees C we the report says we could likely lose the vast majority of our coral reefs and\nIf it was able to get a hold of the climate change and global warming going on right now have as many people would suffer from lack of water there will be fewer deaths and illnesses from heat and smog and infectious diseases sees would rise\nA about four inches less and there will be substantially fewer heat waves and downpours and droughts\nOne author says this is a monumental task to reverse our current course but it is not impossible what do you see\nThe good news that is not impossible and and that four inches of extra sea level rise between at one point five Sea World in to the world is worth fighting for because that's the difference in exposing an additional ten million people around the world to a restaurant sea level rise so it's really

crossfire\nA civil war started there in twenty four team today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and what eighty three percent of the population are in extreme public ... on the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not a natural catastrophe it say mom made a trauma that as a result of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I wouldn't either side winning\nAnd I want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels is very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean ... conflict goes to the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east of them the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who the to the who fees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOf they rolled over the then government on ... to some ... percent of the country I'm what's happened since then is it a Saudi led coalition with us support and so you tell the European support so it's not that far\nYemeni control of the capital Sana'a on up Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted the front lines of Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nIt goes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of aid and commercial traffic is getting through\nI'm what's happening in Yemen is the ... conflict between the who the is on the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who the Z\nBut other than the other side from the Saudis the lesson the u._k.\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni Shia you also have a split of trout regional power struggle\nBut in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south I'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is this is a humanitarian catastrophe or the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving\nTo death but at the same time there was a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists of al Qaida and ISIS\nAnd it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian melt down but political melt down and look what does that mean it means that the humans are a meltdown is that three and a half million people are on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there was a few to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at gas stations on the road you've got teachers and doctors and nurses were not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself at the moment is being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the sides were waging it was in fact being exploited by extremists and I think the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S and the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian on the political emergency is a cease fire\nWent into whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition settled on right\nThere for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. to us and the others\nWant what's their goal that goal is first of all to roll back who the influence\nIn place before the two thousand um fourteen or two and a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no question about the who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo since the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties not obviously\nSticks in the ... because I met a young ... who ... told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of school children more than forty of them killed in August is just that you're the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians why we I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not want to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority ...\nI'm not costing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being\nProtected them to come up to the war has breached the basically the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the side independent un inquiries\nHave a ... produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a crisis that now I came away saying that the world and it's a wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nA only Yemen filed but depending needs to be picked up because there is not a current debate to replace the failed U.N Security council resolution of twenty Fifteen with something you know there's actually a route map\nTo peace rather than the ... for\nIf we take the issue of um a refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world that you've moved to uh\nPresent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year\nHow does that affect your work we'll just for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today\nMost of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh historically\nFor the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture often children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader and was called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees are you at the U. S. actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means that individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translators and things\nThat are being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who can't now starts a new life to work in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up being targeted because of ... for the U.S then not being allowed in\nEither so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the U.S\nGovernment and the great danger is that a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees contribute more to the American economy than they take out in\nA welfare payments approving program is being strangled and this year um we are having to deal with the fact that there was a historic low in the number of refugees allowed and only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year that ended on September\nThe ... the Trump administrators us into the U.S at the Trump Administration is such a ceiling of thirty thousand for this fiscal year which started on October\n... the first and so what we see is not just the effect on individual lives of those who would have come here there's also the fact the countries around the world is seeing that the U.S doesn't have that back let me give you an example Jordan the second closest ally of the United states in the middle east is dealing with six hundred and fifty thousand registered refugees in Syria\nNever ending fun and never ending a wonderful in this so thank you\nFunding for here in no comes from the listeners of W.

history\nDespite the confidence of museum officials that the prejudice artworks will be recovered experts say they could disappear for years perhaps forever [noise] read what was the before I Witness news\nThe thieves who pulled off the greatest art heist in history had a pretty simple plant they dressed up and cop uniforms and rang the bell it was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace wrote entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere'd been a cake party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum that guard was ... they came in and they turn so she's\nSteve ... talked about that night at an Indian restaurant in two thousand Thirteen\nFirst question was as anybody who I said my partner okay yeah\nThis is the first time that former guard the one who was on duty that night with habit has ever spoken publicly about his experience\nWondering if they might just come up behind my head with a gun or the silence or and just you know do a real quickly\nIt was a terrifying night and all these years later he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he still plays makes a living at it mostly in house bans on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a master's in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing to supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nNighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read and I could bring my horn and practice I was always happy to say yes to filling I'm\nRandy doesn't recall any special training are specific instructions for the night shift beyond the requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on all the florists during his rounds he did this by swiping a magnetic strap\nHe wasn't originally on the scheduled to work the night after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reportedly called in sick edited told him about the carriage has alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to a ... at the watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that connection over this might have something to do with the alarm that went off\nOne of the uniform demand said he recognized Abbott and asked to see his id\nSaid yeah I Do know you\nAnd put his arms up he does the pat down it puts the cuffs on\nAnd on just standing there with my\nJob and going wow you know what what's going on what\nThe written due to see really into some kind of trouble and it's still never occurred to me that they were anything but policemen\nBy stepping out and away from the desk who make Abbott's also stepped away from the still means signaling traveled to the outside world to museums panic button no sooner with Abbott against the wall and handcuffed than Randy was too\nI kept asking him over and over why are we being arrested why are we being arrested and he wouldn't answer so Cofer on\nMy hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes\nSo about the time that he begins putting the duct tape and he says this is a robbery and so then everything was fine like crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly it made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the law was going to your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise]\nUm but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them saying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief and I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they\nThere's nothing here in this museum that is worth my life\nThat the land duct tape around Mandy an address head from tend to scout across their eyes and across their mouths but only a split so they could breed than stare stare they're robbers led the guards you couldn't see anything down the basement\nOne of the themes used and other parents handcuffed to attach Randy to a drain pipe under an limestone think near a boiler\nRandy recall that that the let's combine the two and weirdly courteous\nThe guy who kept me he was making sure that they weren't too tight on my wrist and he adjusted that several times and he said I you're going to be here for a long time so I don't want the ... these to be too tight\nSo he was real column and real nice about it and he also several times said sorry to have to do this\nJust one of the guy to get away from him\nRight and I remember feeling like I needed to prepare myself for deaf if that if it ended up coming to that what does that mean preparing yourself for death\nWas running music through my head a lot just feeling like I don't know what happens to us when we die it's all in history but I'm just felt like I needed to be mentally\nIs there a particular piece of music that\nYou ran through your mind\nDefinitely I remember one of the pieces\nThe Mozart requiem\n\nIt didn't occur to me later that has to do with\nThat has to do with the people [noise]\nRandy spent the next eight hours shackled on the basement floor terrified the entire time that the thieves would return to kill him [noise]\nReporters jak were legal and Kelly horn in an excerpt from last
