[noise] these are tiny tiny scissors taking\nUm a deer aunt or an sharpening on arrowhead corrupt projectile points and then make these little tiny flakes\nOkay you sound went down there a larger one larger one it's a half a quarter of an inch long yeah that's a big yeah that's a big one\nHow do you know that's what they were doing that\nThere is there's a may have for the call these primitive arts festivals where people are making arrowhead today and this is the ... that is what's on the floor after they get through the making of same during pointed this ... this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know ... school\nOf law that made it wasn't my hand that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one there's so many ways to mess up here [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be\nArtifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their stories best when they're found where they were left and storms like recent hurricane Michael can disturb that\nIf you stand in place long enough you can feel the same ... a little bit and it's because you know snow into problems and agitation\nYou think that's the rain as you as you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the light of day for the better part of nine thousand years we've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing\nAnd we got off awful like [noise]\nAnd so they continue the work that was\nWhen a sewer pipes was laid the original work was done by both them suit archaeologist Kelvin Jones\nJust along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's what some of the most important earliest phone intimate Calvin Jones isn't he the one who\nGot a real barrel of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he ... the Jackson has and he's the one who said\nWait a second this dirt is more than dirt as part of this ancient burial site you know here\nThey had a delivery of Sirte and within the ... there were artifacts\nThat is archaeologist Barbara causes a Florida public archaeology network\nAnd we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of long meeting to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest up to seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt and let's just backup\nWhat exactly is the mound this site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mound builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hut when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burned homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today it's a definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climb the stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go\nDescendants of the people who lived here studs\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we're not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand a de\nThese mountains and we're right on top now these mounts have weathered uh was it a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the amount and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on top\nOf the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community would get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have Lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to this throughout the southeast all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at least checks and\nThey were finding copper breast plates or ... ... it's we don't have proper in Florida\nSo it was evidence of trade with those other places\nUnderstanding this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey found women they found one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a dog burial\nWhy is it so important is again a thousand to Fifteen hundred in a community that lived here before the photo came through what what's what does it mean to you\nI just cannot imagine the level of complexity and organization required you know we always think of prehistoric people as primitive but they were complex they lived amongst nature and they were able to take that\n\nFunding

I guess what you're going to probably find out you got challenges going on with your other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river\nAnd really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers say we've retreated to the river keepers office of boats have had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Komen director of Florida state's coasts and remind her colleague\nDr Sondra brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection joined us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all this nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and not coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nWhen the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with salt water is that it encourages these marine credited such an oyster drills and\nLatch onto the oysters and they like come out\nThey sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot the always to can do about it is rather horrific\nCan check it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish\nLet's start with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and ... all the oysters is the fear was that the spill would come in and kill the shows in a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there\nTo re populated think about the functions that moisture surface is beyond\nThe economics like clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race or she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with the bay over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flows planting coach out there and if that culture is that always stir shell what they larval oysters settled on but distributing\nIt without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what would you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the drought\nThat have been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be fair particular types of research that can be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what she needed but they want their livelihood restored\nSo there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find\nIt's throwing short term solutions what about in desalination plant I think\nThey're up more problems and um ... you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but they always just haven't come back\nIt's usually when a system crashes it's not just one thing but there are also other factors in play you know the the reefs and they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nComing from or what does the ... the bay looked like you know how much of the coach sits where it is it's all these questions that will help us\nFigure out a way of making a comeback\nHe this is so interesting because after Sandy Reid did a lot of reporting on people who want it to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with ... as a barrier against that storm coming in you know pass the statue of liberty is a solution aquaculture we're all

Panhandle in the northwest part of the state just truly unbelievable to see a looming crisis homelessness FEMA and aid groups like the American Red Cross providing temporary shelter but then what\nEspecially for the poor and the low income\nWhere we can McCarthy is a senior news producer with W F F you and me and I know you and your colleagues have been really pulling at this threat is quite a story Michael ... fall more than two weeks ago\nBut so many people still displaced do we know how many\nRight when we last spoke with FEMA they told me there are more than a thousand people in shelters at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people in the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than not you know thousand or so people\nWill somebody with family or friends or ... cars a your colleague Lynn had her spoke with ... she was evicted from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage let's listen\nTo like living in our truck [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nWillingly life [laughter] I don't know what I Want [laughter]\nSo you multiply her I'm sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about I mean she was in low income housing but they're all these renters who don't have any recourse she got a FEMA rental assistance\nHousing but where she's supposed to find housing right that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers that that you can use the city's hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting those vouchers\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seen sort of this slow response there also shelter is of course yeah well\nWell er and by the way we see FEMA people all over the place in their boots T shirts they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school and just want to listen to how\nWe say we're in charge and maybe it was just like all the windows busted out back all the trees come down and landed right beside the church so yeah I'm I have an aunt her house was destroyed a brother in law just houses destroyed you know I'll do it while some rooms\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this was driven home we're in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes are not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have health insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have\nThat way to to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people are showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some permanent called one that gives them the ability of lives lost we've got here they don't have anything and so I've got like I've got a system as we call him the loss is allowed\nBut after two days he's here with our through smiling and grace is going to describe it has a job that he can recover and law says\nRight how are people getting by they have no income I think\nThat it's tough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about it Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process or that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for a fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking\nWhat their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nYeah but running water mostly back in some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really ... I have to say it's just\nRemarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even hear it you know inland Tallahassee ruse off high school fifty miles inland it's really a quite humbling a as I say F. S.

more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing again in the five six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal\nAnd as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it or Tom said perhaps corn cob a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old dirt chair but it's conceivable\nSo so that'll be that'll be the excitement this afternoon as removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal and if\n[noise]\nThe scraped material is dumped into the buckets and poured out over what looks like a screen door laying on its side on legs to now move over here to a screen everybody knows that this looks like it's framed and you're brushing that sand truly looking for\nA fun flakes of all the little pieces of stone that the there were when they were making a projectile point one is that when you put it right now [noise] these are tiny tiny lizards taking an I'm an ... an sharpening on heroin or a projectile points and\nThe larger one it's a half a quarter of an inch long this\nBig yeah this is\nHow do you know that's what they were doing with it there's there's a male for the call these primitive arts festivals where people are making arrowhead today\nAnd this is the ... that is what's on the floor after they get through the making of same during warmed up to ... this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand\nYou know ... school\nBuses I mean it wasn't my hands that Dr hunting who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one foot to someone in with them is up here [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologists they reveal their stories best when they're found where they were left and storms like recent hurricane Michael can disturbed that\nIf you stand in a place long enough you can feel the same ... a little bit and it's caused you know snow into problems and agitation\nYou think that's the rain as you are you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we were so very concern is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the letter day for the better part of nine thousand years\nWe've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we got off awfully\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by an angel devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes with laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologist Calvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest fines were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a real barrel of loan delivered to his home and\nHe's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this dirt is more than dirt as part of this ancient burial site yeah yeah\nThey had a delivery of dirt and within the ... there were\nThat is archaeologist Barbara ... because the Florida public\nOf treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of long leading to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean uh how how high near would you say this mountain this is the\nTallest of the seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound this\nSite is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mound builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hut when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burned homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today to definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climb the stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nOr their native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here the descendants of the\nPeople who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we're not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know this concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand ADD these mounds and we're right on top\nAnd would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with ... and with that of course they take part of the mountain and then you have the open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on top\nOf the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community would get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have Lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to this throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating to your like Jackson\nThey were finding copper breast plates ornate copper bracelets we don't have proper in Florida\nSo it was evidence of trade with those other places\nUnderstanding this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey found women they found one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a dog burial\nWhy is it so important is again a thousand to Fifteen hundred a community that lived here before just Soto came through what what's it what does it mean to you\nI just cannot imagine the level of complexity an organization required you know we always think of prehistoric people as primitive but they were complex they lived amongst nature and they were able to take that", "year":
