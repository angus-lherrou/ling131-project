Beth hey Jeremy and what do you make of what we're hearing from Collins and Jeff Flake and what about Lisa Murkowski and other undecided Republican\nWell our team caught up with Lisa Murkowski on the hell not long ago and she said she's revealing the information she she really didn't give\nMuch indication of where her a vote would go but look with with senator Collins doubt saying calling the investigation thorough a Senator Flake saying it produced no new crop writing information as you said that's a sign that they essentially got what they needed a to vote yes for this nomination it's this FBI investigation\nHowever uh a brief and not conclusive as it probably was given how few ah that we've learned that not that many people were interviewed and the whole thing just took place over the course of a few days it was enough to get these undecided Republicans some cover and and and probably enabled them to vote yes\nWell and in fact Ford was not interviewed by the FBI for this and neither was Cavanaugh a that's a Judiciary Committee chair\nDegreed areas we as many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts [noise] having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized so\nThat's the message from Senate Democrats where did they go from here or do you expect the Chuck Schumer and Dianne

from the author of the piano tuner\nYes it takes readers from imperial Vienna to the frozen front into the horrors of war maggot infested starvation it's also about the nascent field of medicine about the psychiatric total of four on soldiers but we now understand this pie TST Daniel Mason is a physician and it shows\nAnd it's a romance with shades of doctor Zhivago and the moment in history when people could be separated in an instant with little hope of ever find each other again Denny Mason joined us from ...\nThis story this time in history\nIt'd be a very different different novel I'm a psychiatrist and I was very interested in this period psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was reading about a psychiatrist at the time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involved the first World War\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and\nAs I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the author on during army was so ill prepared that\nThey began to recruit a medical students sometimes ... to serve very important roles and feel hospitals on the front tending to massive numbers of men\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school\nAnd all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time a hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to perform a medical responsibilities that he was on credit for something to that resonated with me and the place I was in at that time\nWell and he he's issued an army issued medical manual that offers advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instruction for the soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about what was it might be teeming with maggots just horrifying and churning clumps they team they stir like embers your life as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and seen that came out upon our comes grainy like wet meal just\nDisgusting because of the ... you know these moist dressings and amputations which he had no idea how to do and enter this non who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I hadn't imagine having the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that was just sort of arrived at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical stuff there and there'd be a nurse would\nProvide a background role but much like Lucia is I found when I encountered her she ended up picking over the story and she has very forceful voice in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSomething from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she's first\nDealing with Lucy is who again has arrived at this place she doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with headphones and amputate the split this leg this elbow that for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this is soldier Lou should ask\nIf he wakes up we tell him he's home because his father you call him son\nYou know right there just a snapshot of\nWho she is and the Washington Post right she's your most irresistible creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her part in the inevitable movie adaptation were you thinking cinematic Lee because it is I felt as if I was seeing a film as well as reading a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly fit a medically I think that I'm very drawn to visual images at the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings\nBecause this takes place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I had all grown up imagining in the trenches and muddy fields of of Belgium this is different these are these large landscapes across which there's this encounter not only\nWith these modern military armies but also very traditional ones soldiers on horseback ... glances and this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time [laughter]\nLoses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I'd say many if not most of the kinds of the war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumble into this classic Russian classic advance and a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and the rest of\nThe book really looks at this other aspect of war what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals what's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their minds as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment they called it nervous shock sure so as a psychiatrist I've been aware that\nOne of the signal injuries of World War one is shell shocked and yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen is that some new kind of virus\nMost of it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about the high explosives that was used during the war is actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf or the scan it into the brain and causing an injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's what we see Lucia sorry Dr mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret the nine is using this as a human being who is suffering\nIs this something because you said you relate to a lot to lose just do does this something that a transition you went through as a doctor\nIt is I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and the when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into wards and meet people\nIs a very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon\nThere's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them on their family and those people who care for them\nAnd that and increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that moves just go through\nA we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notions there was\nThe ... old professor Indiana who steals and alleged murder made from a museum because he wants to actually to see what it is enter a young scientist a female scientist by the name of Marie Curie [laughter] who helps with that there was a staffer at the field hospital who was told he had manly hands\nAnd because he thinks they're special he doesn't want to wash them with just caustic soap so he gets dysentery and dies it's replaced by another soldier with the same name doesn't inserted into war\nAnd probably to every conflict but particularly to this conflict ... bureaucracy was so expensive and so entrenched and so slow and reacting to realities of the battle the ground that the soldiers within it\nWhich were horrifying often but at the same time could with the kind of gallows humor that that one and counter them on the front the approach in some ways for some some kind of humor\nWell there's also a with a doctor Zhivago for us and we are not going to give away your incredible ending\nKnocked me over when I got to it but there's a moment where Lucy is is chasing McGregor someone he thinks his Margaret's two crowds he can't find her of course ... ah go he chases a woman as well but again without giving away the ending or either the plot I don't want to split up for people that\nTalk about that sense that people could get separated in war and there's no social media and you may never see someone again\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

B. or he joins us now I can tell them hijacking and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures so the projection\nIs about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective\nA spending usually does grow year over year but the average growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like Macy's\nRight so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increase can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they will just be showrooms you can actually buy them there you see them in a physical space in that order on\nThis is the ... model of where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for the\nFifteen dollars an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season the market research firm weak field of research published a survey last week about a thousand retailers and report the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars in forty cents that's a big jump from an average of eleven and Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just about seven dollars an hour a nationally what about the trade war and tariffs as I can have an impact on how much we're spending on\nGifts could other Retail Federation says it's concerned about those tariffs has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... of the tariffs especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nOne more thing account big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on\nHere right so uh it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on in investors' minds but of course they are weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury note is considered a very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get in the riskier stock market\nBut if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to pick up even more ... of WB or thank you so much to

embrace of democracy shows a better path for all of the Chinese people\nKind of course insists Taiwan is part of its territory and actively works too isolated diplomatically and that power struggle is

second biggest economy\nChinese foreign minister Wang Yi praised El Salvador for what he described as it's unconditional adherence to the one China principle that Taiwan is part of the mainland and not a separate democratic country China will not recognize or do business with countries that have relations with Taiwan ...\nThis is a great choice sentient forms the international norms and trends of the time said long\nTaiwan's international support began waning after it lost its seat to mainland China and the United nations in Nineteen Seventy one by the Nineteen nineties about thirty countries still chose Taiwan over Beijing\nBut China has been ... away at those allies today only sixteen countries and the Vatican still recognized Taiwan the biggest bloc of support is in Central

you grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine\nAnd you were called the liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\n... what are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that\nI don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that\nUh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had no inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a\nA feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out\nBut then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false I was fine when saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and\nI just want it to be able to tell my side of the stories of people to understand what I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward and I just felt\nUm I think we're all about to find out on what is the December twelve\nHe was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that started happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he'd messed up he'd just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean it met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know um but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this non disclosure now my fear lies mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they are awesome [laughter]\nBut what is that what is that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone I was used to be able to go to the\nBathroom alone [laughter] that's gone\nBut over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they harbor this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years\nUm as it shaped the way that you perceive to him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much I stills\nThere's all business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents of companies and people at high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very privileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today\nHow would you describe him today\nI don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair within ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news now are you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nAh actually the exact opposite [laughter] from around the ... [noise] yeah for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over and over\nDo not following politics closely\nUm things yes but I'm not reading the news in the news stories and specially staying away from anything about me where you're coming out with this book just a month before the midterm elections do you want this to influence the way that people vote\nThat was not my intention at all that was literally how fast can get done how fast can get print that how fast can this happen it was not a strategy at least not on my part maybe the publisher smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nWhat do you what happened in the mid term elections or do you do have a view on that\nYou know I Do I think that it's going to be very interesting like I said I've watched everything turn I don't want to jinx anything so I'm just going to wait and see\nOkay I Want to ask you about one more thing that's in the news right now which is that President Trump has been talking at these rallies about bred cats\nChristian ... furious\nI've got one\nRight I Want to be [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was wonder\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get

originals EJ from the here and now DJ sessions Travis Holcomb at KCRW in Santa Monica high try this\nHello Jeremy great to be back ... to ... how have you been it's been so long since we've talked to you I Know I like ever since the last time we spoke and or at least since the last time I've been to this NPR studio they've completely redone it oh wow I sort of you are okay but the music will still\nBe incredible because it's coming from you this is the first one polo and pan to French DJ [noise] this is their song\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo they're saying they're sweet them why do they see on which is following me under the ocean I can tell us about this one [noise]\nYou know this album ... by polo and pan it came out last year but then it got re released this year in the states with five additional tracks and that's when it sort of came on to my radar um it's got a very tropical kind of feel that route the album um and I know we're in the fall now but it's been a while since I spoke to you so just\nTo catch everybody I'm er I'm classic this this this is the sound of the summer I um it'll you can still use it next summer too but\nThree or four songs on an album I'm really happy and it's I I consider that to be a good album or this care about album though has Seventeen tracks and I think I've played something like fourteen of I'm On my show already\nSo basically like every every track on this album is great and that is like an unheard ratio for for my show to be ended that many of\nThe songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have they have like some songs inspired by Brazilians some butter some daytime disco system club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the ... overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say you know they've definitely got an ear for a pop 'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bands I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meets cool side\nOh I like that that is great we had to a site on the show actually they're great um yeah let's listen to the next one you brought up this is the Swedish group by agra boys are this is called sport [noise]\n\n\n\nTell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely without going on but I've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people they're saying it's a commentary on male hyper masculinity ... um when I first heard it I just thought it was a really goofy fun track\n'em and it's one of those songs like it reminds me when I was little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep and is it would give me a way to fire up before bed\nAnd this song sort of has the same effect on me every time I hear it and\nObviously funny would you say it's like a good listening to do you like to listen to\nThe song is an unbelievably fun lesson yes I mean like it's after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time as the sun moves on to become the belief singers bashing Murphy becomes more and more\nBut people people can go on our website and listen to the entire thing it here now I Hope they I really hope they do okay or the next one is from Ireland uh this is mavericks saber a who just released this new songs drifting period it\nJust\n\n\nI like that why do you ... absolutely I mean it's such an orthodox delivery to and I think that's the first thing that really caught my attention with this song or the beat is really simple really funky but more than that it's just sort of the way he sounds on it was just kind of other worldly who is maverick saber\nHe's an Irish R. and B. singer I'm I guess he has\nBeen releasing record since two thousand eleven I Know a lot of people had been fans with him for a while I just sort of caught on to him with Tucson drifting a but he's also on the label of Georgia Smith who was sort of a an up and\nComing R. and B. singer from the u._k. and he's appeared on one of the Georgia Smith a peas the

D. M. singer under the name winter Gordon but I feel like this is\nYes but clearly multi talented person [noise] yeah I mean she she definitely knows how to write songs and and she can sing them too I mean sometimes when the singer things you can sort of feel their heart and soul and sweat of experience in their voice to me this is one of those instances [noise]\nUm she just sort of recalling her upbringing sort of you know it's also very aspirational at the same time\nThe last one that you have brought us is albatross this is from Westerman\nRecords the waste in Oregon so [noise] but\nDid you check [noise] [noise]\nWhich we know about this one so albatross is the first single from west demands forthcoming arc E.

people could be separated in an instant with little hope that we're finding each other again\nDenny Mason joins us from ... in San Francisco welcome and congratulations\nThank you it's wonderful to be on the show\nWell how did you come to this story this time in history\nIt began as a very different different novel I'm a psychiatrist and I was very interested in spirited psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was writing about a psychiatrist at the time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involves the first World War\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and\nAs I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the Australian army was so ill prepared that\nThey began to recruit a medical students sometimes dentist sometimes veterinarians to serve very important role in your hospitals on front tending to knock the numbers of men [noise] and this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school and\nUsing his medical training and being asked to foreign medical responsibilities of he was so impressed for something that resonated with me and the place I was in that time\nWell I mean he he's issued an army issued medical manual that offers advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instructions a soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about what was it might be teeming with maggots just horrifying in churning clumps they team they stirred like embers these are life as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and seem\nThey came out upon our comes grainy like wet meal [laughter] it's just\nDisgusting because of these ... you know these moist dressings and amputations which he had no idea how to do and enter this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I had an imagined her having the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that was just would arrive at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical stuff then there'd be a nurse would provide a background role for much like Lew shares\nI found when I encountered her she ended up picking over the story and she has very forceful force in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first\nDealing with Lucia so again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with had moons than amputate this what this leg this elbow that for arm that arm over there we can let the and this is soldier loses asks smelling like that she says he'll be dead by morning\nDon't worry you didn't do it we keep them warm if he wakes up we tell him he's home because his father you call him son\nYou know right there just a snapshot of\nWho she is and the Washington Post writes she's your most irresistible creation actresses Oliver Hollywood she'd be jockeying to play her part in the inevitable movie adaptation were you thinking cinematic Lee because it is I felt as if I was seeing a film as well as reading a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic we I think that I'm very drawn to visual images of the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings because the sixth place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I ... imagining in the trenches and muddy field\nThere's this encounter not only with these modern military armies but also very traditional ones soldiers on horseback ... glances and this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time\n[laughter] loses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I'd say many if not most of the kinds of the war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumbles into this classic rushing caustic advance and a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and the rest of\nThe book really looks at this other aspect of for what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals what's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their minds as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment they called it nervous shock\nSure so as a psychiatrist I've been aware that one of the signal injuries of World War one is shell shocked\nAnd yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen is that some new kind of\nVirus is is a reaction to this new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial\nThought that there was something about the high explosives that was used during the war is actually sending microscopic particles through the ... through the skin into the brain and causing an injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's where we see Lucia is our doctor mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret benign issuing this as a human being who is suffering\nIs this something because you said you relate to a lot to lose just do does this something that a transition you went through as a doctor\nIs I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and\nTheir own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into words and meet people is very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and\nThey don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon there's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them on on their family and those people who care for them\nAnd that and increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that moves just go through\nA we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notions there was\nThe daughter and old professor in Vienna who steals an alleged murder made from a museum because he wants to actually get to see what it is enter a young scientist female scientist by the name of Marie Curie [laughter] who helps with that there was a staffer at the field hospital who was told he had manly hands\nAnd because he thinks they're special he doesn't want to wash them with just caustic soap so he gets dysentery and dies is replaced by another soldier with the same name does it absurdity to war\nRight and probably to every conflict but particularly to this conflict Australian bureaucracy was so expensive and so entrenched\nAnd so slow and reacting to realities about on the ground that the soldiers were then I Would often come up against these absurd situations which\nWere horrifying often but at the same time could with the kind of gallows humor that that one encountered them on the front the approach in some ways for some some kind of humor\nWell there's also a with a doctor Zhivago for us and we are not going to give away your incredible ending\nKnocked me over when I got to it but there's a moment where Lucy is is chasing my Greta someone he thinks is Margot register crowds he can't find her of course dot to shove I'll go he chases a woman as well but again without giving away the ending or either the plot I don't want to spoil it for people that\nTalk about that sense that people could get separated in war and there's no social media and you may never see

and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and look\nRetailers prepping for the holidays got some good news this week the national Retail Federation expects holiday spending to increase by around four to five percent because of destroying the economy but there's a downside the low unemployment rate will make it very hard for stores to find seasonal workers\n... senior innovation reporter at W. B. or he joins us now I call them hijacking and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with past year so the\nProjection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective\nA spending usually does grow year over year but the average growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like Macy's\nRight so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history\nAnd meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year is way fair the online furniture retailer they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they will just be showrooms you can actually buy them
