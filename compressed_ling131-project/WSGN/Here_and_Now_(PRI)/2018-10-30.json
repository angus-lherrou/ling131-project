G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big guy ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea of having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions\nBut he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAri let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we are going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let out for their first it's my turn it outraged by measuring the get out it's my turn on your program when I get out ... okay here's Cordray getting a word and we are the\nWorst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day\nOr because of opioid abuse and ... and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those and\nIt would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out\nCan get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or water people what's on their minds\nWell it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it\nAnd um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind but the most recent polling shows is that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nAnd that is a big deal it's always a big deal that Ohioans have approved at the ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to fly out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good\nOpportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on\nUs joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us now is ed Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during fly my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like\nSomething more than that something perhaps\nTo do with air speed indicators\nAnd a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things are a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a ... very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll tell you that flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane it had flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nYeah it's it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nAre flying you know for that matter the airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border and and you know of course\nYou could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened ah but you know the newness of an airplane in of itself shouldn't cause something any more than ... you know a very old airplane as long as it's maintained properly\nBut we're not talking here nobody is talking about pilot error nobody is talking about whether or anything like that they're they're looking investigators it appears or looking mostly just at the mechanics of this airplane\nRight and you know the biggest question of all if we're going to be talking about the human error might not be those pilots on board again in all of this very preliminary but\nFunding for here and now comes from fracture creating frame of photo decor and gift by printing digital photos directly on glass a fracture is image and mountain one

S. to parents who are not citizens of the U. S. and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now is Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today Hi Allan Hi German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which are reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and of the state where in they reside\nSo how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\nTo very good question um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight by the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo that's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the phrasing that you said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who was an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here um through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant\nGiving birth here just so that their child has US citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle to climb\nExcite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nYeah the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant caravan coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring it a national emergency and just this week that his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nActive duty military troops down to the U.S border to stop them that's on top of already Twenty one hundred national guardsmen that are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up\nI'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this was a strategy that worked for him obviously in twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave\nIn this midterm election\nHe's just going back to the playbook that worked for him and saying hey let's just hammer down on immigration over and over and see if that works\nAnd those migrants are they talking about by the way they're over a month away from the United states by walking and that's if they go about thirty miles per day\nExactly so the idea of having the military on the border right now is probably not necessary\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

in the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is a common account deficit and uh we're not built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners but what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of their Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into this\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it a good cause the debt overall total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation is a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nBut that's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates in fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nRecent week trip rates low as ... unemployment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't feel that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand I think\nThat what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand method is there a two conditions as hard for a crisis one is there a toxic asset like a\nSecured ties to mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and one day off\nTo anything like that right now\nNo not in any area\nWell I don't want to be a general you know that that was a very extraordinary period court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity but it's a shoe or when you get the sort of tight labor market\nWage ... hours of necessity and it's for wage right rises which affect the cost of production and hence induce\nTo start raising prices basically because their costs are going up that's where the problem is that hasn't really been growing up\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nMore creative destruction is a process by which people do two things they continuously unrest but the investment is displacing\nOlder equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process which unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically as we point out in the book is the result of creative destruction which means essentially for example when a booth open hearth ... steel industry\nA whole slew of procedures\nBut the closer workers associated with those particular furnaces screws loose their jobs to ... the liberal forces continuously changing hunger\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and from Geico offering the guy called mobile lap the guy called mobile app stores ID

nine years old David Rosenthal fifty for Bernice Simon was eighty four Sylvan Simon was eighty six Daniel Stein aged Seventy one Melvin wax\nEighty eight and ... younger\nWas sixty nine they all spent time in the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish but it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making a show\nA show we wish we had help us through a week like this\nWere British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us from ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was foreign uh he moved to scroll hill when he got married Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell then this is really sad day in the neighborhood [noise] um I Know that I'm afraid in July ... the community that diverse than the diversity in the community and square all hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and\nI'm noticing the tree and then the various chemicals and synagogues and churches um that all made him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessens and he often commented that he could hear ye decent Hebrew and it doesn't have a language is spoken\nAnd walk down the street out of that community\nHe actually learned ... and they pay get yes ah do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\n[noise] um they can survive just neighborhood I think that um\nAnd to the neighborhood the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community and probably I'll say the ... community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination a that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady Arlen\nDoes assassination me [noise]\n\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it means\nWell it means somebody getting killed in a\nSort of surprised way that's\nWhat happened you know men killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about a lot of people are sad scared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day whenever you like [noise]\nThat sound or courtesy of the Fred Rogers company laid ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic\nOr she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] I think one of the things that you caught us all is that it's All right to have the feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid and there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children for message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim now where it's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it\nOften said was that his mother always told him and times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with so that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers\nYes\nAs part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence which isn't\nI've been terribly concerned about the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing recently\nAnd I clean for your protection\nIn support of your young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child can take with out of me overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think for Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\n[noise] well I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but he also I think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good nest attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFred Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children ... and others can use this life I'm In very meanings\nRogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend [noise]\nWell I think he would be horrified\nBy what happened in ... and he would\nHe would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may the these reactions in the adult\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn the feelings on normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people\nUm and I you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also said we need to turn to our neighbors and\nNeighbor in the greater sense of the world [laughter] everyone lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support\nTo our neighbors to people of all backgrounds some oh phase of all races so that we can live together on this earth and very productive place\nWhat's this been like for you living right they're outside of Pittsburgh\nUh it's [laughter] um\nBut it's been very hard I've been a meeting and talking with some of the teachers got 'em in early childhood programs to make my own background his tribe development in early childhood\nAnd so I've been talking to some of the teachers and the directors of programs um some as they did the Jewish preschool programs ... what we can do we're actually going to be having a conference next week\nUm to talk about these poor children for

G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties um and served with him a sellout\nStay in office he went in with some other states and filed against a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAri let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let ... it's my turn it outraged by measuring the get out it's my time you're going to get out shy per hour it's like OK here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we have the highest increase in funding all deaths last year and he stays in the nation All right so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day\nOf because of opioid abuse and ... and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but\nUh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people\nWho have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or water people what's on their minds\nLet's say like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid and uh because uh\nYou know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it what's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows is that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\n[noise] now a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nIs a big deal it's always a big deal that Ohioans have approved at that ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to fly out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good\nOpportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on\nUs joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash\nJoining us now is ed Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know the shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell water has to do with war you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially going a radical you doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nA very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know is that the played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so ah the very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll tell you that flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane it had flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nAre flying you know for that matter the airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border\nAnd and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you can ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened\nUh but you know the newness of an airplane in of itself shouldn't cause something any more than ... you know a very old airplane as long as it's maintained properly\nBut we're not talking here nobody is talking about pilot error nobody is talking about whether anything like that they're they're looking investigators it appears or looking mostly just at the mechanics of this airplane\nRight and you know the biggest question of all if we're going to be talking about the human error might not be those pilots onboard again in all this very preliminary but you know if all of that happened the day before well what happened after that you know what was was the plane taken in for the kind of check that you would expect it to have been taken it\nTuesday November six that's seven pm on WB H M\nFunding for here and now comes from fracture creating frame less photo decor and gifts by printing digital
