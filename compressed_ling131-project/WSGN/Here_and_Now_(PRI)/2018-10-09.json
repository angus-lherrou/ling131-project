K. bench plastic\nWe are all here yes yes Justin Paul hello there even lettuce and hello\nBench I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIt's not directly based on something had happened to my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to\nSort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were a myself included\nAnd I was struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of\nPublic we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that\nFurther well but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets up every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling themselves about how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also that the people around him are ... by the story as well um he feels as though he's giving some\nOf their son who course isn't I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear haven't mother are struggling single mom when she finds out evidence been taken in by Congress family because she can't get him a lot of things that they can\nGet some way it was\n\nOn me [laughter] I'm not [laughter]\nHow you were able to get those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nYou know it's true that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because the book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and the same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow bill any a sweaty palms this is very special to people all these characters and especially Evan Hansen really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of sweaty and still sweaty ends in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being what do you ever becoming more sweaty argument through that rabbit hole before here but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you add the I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize\nI have experience with let's just say I know I'm just the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and the and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's there's a him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't wanna give anything away but I have to say we actually find out his back story and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about counter but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ... I understand that why you did they did what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it fan fiction they were they were writing about Evan Connery what might happen\nThis is just than you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing the novel adaptation was ...\nMore red watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people have wanted to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place it\nIs a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents said that humanize them and ultimately it's really about how

clothing and food and health care and temporary shelter aid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll\nThey have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program as drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem the ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians do swear to abide by ethical standards Philip can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits Cuban conferences but continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to monitor and ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were you that people take care of their teams are girls themselves recognizing group it was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of\nStay within their areas of expertise one of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSays you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath ear able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues had noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores if Greece up pretty high margin is quite community\nHow could that caused problems and how are you dealing with that\nWe've been impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa and the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHad grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a a shared a humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have known for quite some time and I know you are as you said Greek American you go to Greece\nIn one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is is like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned you're in the states and to get back to the origins of you know my family's migration\nIn the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nTo be able to go back\nAnd offer would I we were just there in September talking to folks in so long ago and a half ... above the work that we do um the recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way has been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilip can deal is thank you actually so That's Dr Phil ... who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid workers\nBack to the U.S now and a story from the American west walk through forests of that region and you're likely to see centuries old pine and cedar trees that have had their bark peeled off in a special way\nAs Kay UNC Israel in the shell reports archaeologist don't know why ancient tribes peeled some of the bark away and they're running out of time to solve the mystery\nCassandra ten CEO says for tribes like the southern you southwest Colorado these ponderosa pines are as important as cliff dwellings or picked a graph\n'cause we're we're we're a little over a nomadic and we weren't like pillows and are are now all of these trees show that we were here\nAttention as a cultural representative for the southern you Indian tribe these special ponderosa pines are scattered across the Rocky Mountain region and they all have something in common a big chunk of bark missing from one side peeled away by people sometime in the last few hundred years this Israel\nAt places a footprint on the landscape as you people as a tribe\nThere are a bunch of them here on the edge of a meadow south of the San Juan mountains\n... right there\nMark Mitchell walks up to in our old tree about as wide across as to people it's thick red bark is curling into reclaiming exposed area that looks a lot like a telephone pole we're looking at a place where\nWhite material inside called ...\nSome people describe it as a little astringent I think it tastes kind of coconut\nMitchell is a research director for a nonprofit archeology organization called the paleo cultural research group they teamed up with the forest service to study trees like this one volunteers start taking measurements that sort of one person starts screwing a hollow killing to the tree as thin as a drinking straw area\n\nThe simple will give a date for when the fuel happened gotta perfect there are a lot of questions about these ... trees\nYes there are a one of the biggest questions we have is what precisely was the purpose of law we know it's edible\nBut he says where people eating it because it was a delicacy or because they were starving with medicine or part of a special occasion Julie Coleman wonders if these trees might reveal patterns about how tribes like the you were moving across the landscape she's an archaeologist with the San Juan national forest\nGPS unit the get quite pots and each tree and then hopefully we'll see a pattern and you might show trails in ways\nThat mark Mitchell says they're running out of time to study the peeled trees\nWe feel at the clock is ticking now it's been taking for a while but we really feel the urgency of it now\nDrought could kill these trees or and expanding beetle infestation could cripple them with the fungus called blue stain or wildfires could erase them\nSome of the big fires the really bad in Colorado in the last five or six years have taken some of the streets we know that\nBut time could also get them some of these trees could be five hundred years old like this one\nOh wow that is cool\nThat is neat that I was hoping we would write all these\nFor this treat people didn't just scrape off the edible part the also pried off six planks of would presumably to build something like a traditional cradle board to carry a baby and that's what it reminded Cassandra ten\nCEO of oh wow seeing it brought her to tears\nFor here and now

question came up out in the first place [noise]\nAll these documents were part released in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key document is an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as a secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty sexes and ... he says that he initially\nThought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen and then a over those months he worked with his status\nThe question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states it's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been um there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey what\nReason then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least once a thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the law suits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted responses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially to make sure those groups have the right to vote\n'em that the law the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data or from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the tradition says that data is not enough or is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include\nA communication between a Kris Kobach the current a Republican gubernatorial candidate as well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross addict citizenship question and his concern was that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency or the Twenty one twenty seven\nThe Census Bureau for what does a massive undertaking well\nThe uh the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross added will stay or will it go and where you probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play an important part for live households and may not be comfortable I don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd so this is a really big question right now that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve\nA from the Census Bureau perspective and other big questionable they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collect a information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... long thanks a lot\nYou're welcome the anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy made headlines over the weekend by regain his own artwork to self destruct\nHis painting of a little girl letting go of a heart shaped balloon began to shred itself just after it was sold for nearly one point four million dollars at southern ... in London this latest stunt has the art world buzzing and many more people wondering once again who is Banksy\nSophia ... has been exploring that question for the sun in London I said\nHey [laughter] and first your thoughts when you saw that painting slide down the picture frame in shreds at the auction\nOh my goodness it was an ... a hot stove paying maintenance and the first question was why is it happening and and the second was how how is it happening because obviously at the time they want to me that that was shredded built into the frame\nSo you can imagine the shock and horror not just in that ... everyone's eyes are not painting that time\nAnd for some people listening that was their first introduction to Banksy so tell us what we know about him because he's a a a man we think who is famous for being mysterious\nHe ... he famously being mysterious and his name is Scott ... of the uh swelled and he he basically he's an enormous English artist he's a street and graffiti artists that he kind of guys named as a political artist as well and you kind of shade I put it seems like the nineties and\nAnd he's black originally highlights did a lot of corruption and inequality and society but he did it in a very humorous way nowadays if he misses slightly less and he takes them a series pain in his walk and as you say he's never been to\nWell they may as a big theory that he was in the ... when the painting the shredded\nWhoa so let's talk about some of the theories then what do you know 'cause there are people who who think they've seen him at work doing one of ... installations on a wall somewhere or in what you know we don't know who he is so um what are some of the theories about about who this ... this mysterious artist might be\nThey have ranged from him being a painter and decorate to to another graffiti artist named king ... and people say he's Damian Hess people even say that\nYou know banks he may well be a woman and there's another theory that he's and not just one person he is a collection of artists it's just because he's such a a an icon of mystery the the theories range from what could potentially be the tree to something very outrageous and I think there was a\nBond that they said he was the from mine if the bonds and because every time that bond performed in this that and like ... see the ... pop and the guy had to come out and saying it's definitely not me I have a creative bone in my ...\n... what do you think he was trying to say bye shredding painting\nIn my opinion and I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the fast time his what has gone up for sale and and it's something that has been done without his consent\nThis time I had to see I I this is just my past and opinion on the opinion that certain people I ... that the painting and the shutting if the painting was away at him saying my ... for one pass and it's for everybody and because this painting it shut it off to the Hummer wet and\nIt was a way of him saying they swap doesn't belong to anybody he he never paints he never does his graffiti odds in a place that\nCan belong to one pass and he does it in public spaces he does and in places where it would be very difficult trim east and or anybody to claim that that all walk\nAnd I think that's what he did he wants his message and he wants his what to be for everybody rather than ... take initiatives at other theories I've had a he wants his wife to have a great ...\nOf the times I've had that he wants his wife to be priceless so it could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide Schroeder inside a picture frame without anybody other news the auction house was enormous ...\nHealth and installing a shredder inside and I think he was the passage in on that um\nIt could it could very well it's been someone's inside the base in on it but maybe a friend who maybe not that and other graffiti artist he maybe was lacking that but I ... I ... and it was it was tea bakes anybody to have them anticipate said\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and carbon night offering secure it\nHi event ability and disaster recovery solutions and automated data migration learn more at ... dot com and Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance as soon as the Geico insurance agency\nAdditional information can be found at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nIt's here and now in Afghanistan today a suicide bomber killed a candidate running in this month's parliamentary election it's the latest in a series of attacks that have been carried out by the Taliban or ISIS fighters in the country this here this week mark Seventeen years since the U.S launched the war in Afghanistan less than a month after the nine eleven attacks\nPresident George W.

B. uh ... dot org and thank you\nOut at\nMy first\nIt was a musical gear Evan Hanson the story of a socially awkward will be gone high school senior who gets caught in a ... that spiraled out of control about being the best friend of a classmate he actually hardly knew who takes his life and before you know that our dear Evan Hansen is leading a national movement against suicide\nIt was a huge hit when it debuted on Broadway plays [noise]\nMe I was in\nAnd I'm always goes on\n\nHere and in Hampton one six Tony Awards including best he's ago so besides a national tour what could its creators bend you pass it can just in palm music and lyrics and book author Stephenson do for an encore\nHow about a young adult novel which captivated this adult as well author that and I wrote the new deer Evan Hansen booklets input from the show's creators and all for joining us from the NPR studios in New York down and making their yes R. M. K. bench pass it\nWe are all here yes S. Justin Paul hello there even Lance and hello\nThen I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nNot directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community after his death really began to\nStruck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of\nPublic we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets up every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmates but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well I um she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear evidence mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans have been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\nGet some way it was Jerry\nI'm Sorry I'm not as\nYou were able to put those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters you know it's true\nTemple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel that they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people named he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say adding also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before where I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity and the intensity\nWith with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk about this notion that you're writing about suicide Iraq I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize that's\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know I'm just the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and the U.N mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's there's a him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before\nIs it all you know I'm darkness they don't want to give anything away but I have to say we actually find out his back story and we find out this a crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine\nMore about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know it you know doing it and you're on a national stage there's that but a bench pass\nIt and I just didn't ... I understand that while you debated what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical you fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan and Conor what might happen\nYeah this is just than you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing the novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listened to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\nIt is a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents said that humanize them and ultimately it's really about how we relate to our family members how we hide ugly truth about\n\nFor here and now comes from W.

in Spain Italy and Greece this year\nEvery day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos\nThe first faces they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore yeah clothing and food and health care and temporary shelter\nAid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program as drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem the ancient originated in Greece it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards fill up can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits Cuban confidences but continue to this day\nCan tell us is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we would you go that people take care of their teams take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells the story of one she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a civilian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult in desperate\nSo you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really ...\nBut our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores if Greece up pretty high margin is quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa and the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHad grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the fall it's me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seems to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a a shared a humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have known him for quite some time and I know you are as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back\nAnd offer what I can we were just there in September talking to folks in so long ago and Athens\nSo being able to collaborate in this way it's been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilip can deal is thank you actually so That's Dr Phil ... who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid workers\nBack to the U.S now and a story from the American west walk through forests of that region and you're likely to see centuries old pine and cedar trees that have had their bark peeled off in a special way\nAs Kay UNC Israel and ... reports archaeologist don't know why ancient tribes peeled some of the bark away and they're running out of time to solve the mystery\nCassandra ten CEO says for tribes like the southern Utah southwest Colorado these ponderosa pines are housed important as cliff dwellings or picked a graph\n'cause we're we're we're a little over a nomadic and we weren't like pillows and are are now all of these trees show that we were here\nAttend CEO is a cultural representative for the southern you Indian tribe these special ponderosa pines are scattered across the Rocky Mountain region and they all have something in common a big chunk of bark missing from one side peeled away by people sometime in the last few hundred years\nThis Israel\nAt places a footprint on the landscape as you people as a tribe\nThere are a bunch of them here on the edge of a meadow south of the San Juan mountains\nHome dinner at their\nArchaeologist mark Mitchell walks up to in our old tree about as wide across as to people it's thick red bark is curling into reclaiming exposed area that looks a lot like a telephone pole\nWe're looking at a place where in the ... native peoples of a movie out of there\nHe says they did it to get to a spongy white material inside called ...\nSome people describe it as a little astringent I think it tastes kind of coconut\nMitchell is a research director for a nonprofit archeology organization called the paleo cultural research group they teamed up with the forest service to study trees like this one volunteers start taking measurements sodas one person starts screwing a hollow kill and to the tree as thin as a drinking straw area\n\nThe sample will give a date for when the peel happened\nOr but there are a lot of questions about these ... trees yes there are a lot of the biggest questions we have is what precisely\nStarving with medicine or part of a special occasion Julie Coleman wonders if these trees might reveal patterns about how tribes like the you were moving across the landscape she's an archaeologist with the San Juan national forest\nGPS you get quite pots and each tree and then hopefully we'll see a pattern and you might show trails and all the ways\nThat mark Mitchell says they're running out of time to study the peeled trees\nWe feel at the clock is ticking now that's been taken for a while but we really feel the urgency of it no\nDrought could kill these trees or and expanding beetle infestation could cripple them with the fungus called blue stain or wildfires could erase them\nSome of the big fires that we've had in Colorado in the last five or six years have taken some of the streets we know that\nBut time could also get them some of these trees could be five hundred years old like this one\nOh wow that is cool\nThat is neat that is amazing I was hoping we tried all these\nFor this treat people didn't just scrape off the edible part the also pried off six planks of would presumably to build something like a traditional cradle board to carry a baby
