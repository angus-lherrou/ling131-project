health education the law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death for young Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the ... the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nRick yelling because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York so we wanted to make sure that you know each district could determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward how\nWould that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural areas suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well I'm I'm thinking that Long Island suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know that a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's\nDepending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take into into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is\nWe were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to I have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school into high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools ... people that here now doubt or liberated sample like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum ... and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on kindergarten first grade second grade it's just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means\nWearing his so that when ... comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building into progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment so this night also funnel people to real treatment as opposed to education and then she noticed that position they are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response that look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want\nTeachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's Glen

they attended and the climate give up saying you just had to be there\nAnd that's how it is with Mary courses painting because with every change of light in the room every movement made by the view or something else emerges from the deceptive apparently modeled climatic simplicity\nSome of the paintings are thirty feet long twenty feet long so it takes time as you walk by so was out of the or does

exhibition at the Whitney is called Mary course a survey in light and in fact course calls herself a painter of light was that ... does take issue\nThere's something to commercial about it it sounds like you know such a painter a light right like some really bad PR lesion artist was Seventy five galleries all over the world\nPainter of light is probably more compact than painter who's cruising around with light you know who you wouldn't want to say that\nThe corps throughout our history painters have been screwing around with light is Whitney curator Kim ... points out\nActually her practice has to do with something that painters have been thinking about for centuries think back to an artist like car garage into ...

it's a local issue and if we can mobilize me a little loud voice\nTo make sure that they understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the polls is

hold president a little more responsible you know\nHe has to since he has the biggest microphones she's going to have to uh you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but

we thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut cigarettes Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and it's also about the writing world which is the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together secret newness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond peculiar the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these\nNot just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden what do we know about whether dogs grieve [noise]\nDo know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and and uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to take in the dots\nIt just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dog to sleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I\nI thought what seems odd but I Am sides made yeah can't you can't say for sure that that would have happened well when the when the shots started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say\nIs anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or your present okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something he's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asks where the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know we do have a person who\nIn trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nAlong the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should go to this\nWho suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening buddies not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be boats ... or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah and what about\nYou said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my my married her really does Mitt this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that into a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe had just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nNo dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only son\nHer only solace is that she is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone Oh yes\nThat's that's very moving well and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it it'd have to ask\nYou it is about writers in writing in the community and the teaching of it um [noise] can you give us one tip for those who ah wanna wrestle the story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know with such a punch\nPick up the friend um and how much\nOf this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student riders but is the suicide maybe someone you didn't know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who were contemplating suicide\nOne of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several friends that I had well let me know that suicide was something that was on their mind it's not like they were planning it next week or even next year but it was something that he started at started thinking about and thinking that that it eventually it would happen\nIt's two o'clock [noise]\n\nFunding

test dot com\nIt's here now and now a story that feels not a moment too soon given the news\nIn July New York became the first state to require that every public school have a form of mental health education the law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sort in fact\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the young Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the ... the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans of best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban areas in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states\nBut just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health and jets\nIn some of the idea of therapy and mental health thing on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center a school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts me through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a\nYou know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools you\nGot that teacher training there and other tools so willing people it here in our data word but an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum ... and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on in the ground in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings get fellow thing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health\nThat they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness county has all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment\nA position their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects with kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response that look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that\nYou know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's going to let him and he's the c._e._o. of a nonprofit
