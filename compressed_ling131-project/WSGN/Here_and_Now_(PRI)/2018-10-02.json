Boston and your NPR station and Geico offering motorcycle and RV insurance more information available on motorcycle an RV insurance at\nGeico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThis is here and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement\nJoining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers welcome back to her know\nGlad to be with you Jeremy and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it\nNever seen so much ado about so little I thought the old trade regime between Canada and Mexico in the United states was a good one\nAnd this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth major alienation of major allies I Can't imagine\nAuthority of NAFTA is continuing as it was this has been a major diversion from the important domestic challenges facing the United states and the important international\nChallenges but I'm happy with the new agreement put simply because I was happy with the older Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are\nTiny compared to the overall economy the ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits\nThe ability of North America to remain unified\nWhen we face very serious challenges from Asia has been constrained this has been the most ... short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used to go after them have been quite problematic\nThey emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government\nThey encourage the Chinese on a road to self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leverage influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire Internet\nChinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about Chinese trade practices and in particular the ones relating to intellectual property\nBut I don't think the strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\nThere are all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want\nTariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs the companies need in order to compete\nThat's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient\nAnd so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the\nTaxes on uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas so are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being tax cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nStopped being surprised at Republican craven this in front of President Trump\nIs clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist buddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear\nOf a primary challenge sponsored and supported by President Trump\nAnd President Trump may not have a majority within America with him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able\nWho value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions to stand by his side\nYou know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about senators who were guarded their\nCore beliefs as being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well\n[noise] what do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to recognize that any error and letting inflation rise a little bit too much is likely to be a reversible error at any error in terms of tipping economy into recession\nIs likely to take a very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different economy than we used to\nTherefore I think the approach that's being pursued is okay and I would not be one ah to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do I I have an\nInteresting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying that the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence that at the end of expansions there's a tendency for productivity growth to slow\nAnd that may be for the reason you're a companion suggests that ah when laborers in short supply some of the people hire are a bit less a qualified\nBut it seems to me that what is striking is how slow\nAny pressure for inflation is perhaps that's because of the ...\nA technology so I think it would take quite a lot to generate a substantial acceleration in America and inflation\nI Want to ask you about one more thing which is that we're talking as the stock market is at record highs a lot of people are worried that you know we've been in an expansion for a long time now that the recession is on the way what are your thoughts at this point about that I'd\nBe surprised if some time in the next three years we didn't have a recession evidence is that it's very hard to predict recessions and so the fact that we don't see one coming doesn't assure us that one is not coming\n\nFunding\nFor here

or staples dot com staples\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nIt's here and now and we've spoken here over the years about early retirement a couple of who sold their home traveling in staying in other people's homes to save money\nMillennials who work day and night to earn a million dollars and live off investment income well there's now a name for this it's called fire financial independence retire early and fire is on fire inspired in part by books like your money or your life\nAnd stoked on blogs podcast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent out all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nWell let's let's got tell that he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nI thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast was one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete adding the what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives you move you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on the podcast that was very interesting to me\nAt that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the ... got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was ...\nFive hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town and our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know ...\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so\nTo hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as what was so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really like my job and it for me it's not about work for me it was about a ... myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passion that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around that what'd you and your wife did just to keep the story going his way it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replace tiered created\nI've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant true is that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest breeze to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance\nBut the infamous yeah yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommend it enough that the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game\nAnd have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race is\nOne of the the main roles for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial adviser you're essentially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big dips in dives\nAnd if you can ride those waves if you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a nice entry point for me\nWell and part of this in order to do this and there's a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we'd go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nBut some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing\nYeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that our quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year\nWe could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter and we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents' house maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the air and space and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it's just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire with like ... million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [laughter] I mean have you ever thought about that\nOf course we definitely have thought about that and that's something that you know we were definitely a nervous about an ass a lot about in the beginning\nAnd there was a couple of things about it I think the first thing is the whole premise of financial independence and your investments making enough that it can sustain you is based off of this thing called the trinity study\nAnd it essentially a works out the map to be about Ninety eight percent chance that you won't run out of your a principal a investments\nOver the course of Thirty years if you draw four percent off of that and the ideas that the stock market continues to grow and if it continues to grow that has in the past and you can always sip a little bit off of the top\nAnd you'll never run out of what you had ... at the end of the day one of my dear friends in one of my favorite uh you know fire pie casters her name is Paula ... we're asking her this question and she said you know the worst case scenario is you go back to work\nI think for us the real point here was gaining financial literacy and understanding how money works in our life and what our relationship to money is\nAnd once we saw it as a tool and something that we had more power over just the freedom and the stress a that was relieved that's the magic of fire and its essence\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't greeters of Matt lab that simulates somewhere accelerating the pace of

Smith who a Ford says was there\nA it includes ... is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which\nUh his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country\nHave you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you have the same meaning it was ...\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence or a sixteen year book page on 'em game ... Philip bump that's not what proved means\nWell it's sort of unclear what booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious that a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week Ralph club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse the anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kevin uh about another term as your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n\nDrinking game has played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd you're\nGet a refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engine to try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath [laughter] right\nSo uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of\nUh of suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search a books that they have an ... I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually from separating these uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically a but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says the devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had made\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened if\nYou're asking about yeah blackout I don't know if you\nCould you answer that question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking in order to why okay thank you\nSo Chad ... who's a former yell classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nI I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank there were often times in which he appeared to be in the past hated\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point\nIf it was the case that he with some regularity and high school I got drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence\nAnd remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of disadvantage for happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes I Would think so\nSo they're they're both saying that that line to the committee would be a problem I mean how how is this all playing out a among the people that you're talking to at this point\nWell\nThis is one of the sort of fascinating things here is\nThe extent to which the sort of obvious white lies of him\nOr trying to downplay for example as your book injuries are sort of given up past we sort of established this odd spectrum of these sorts of false words that are are going to be considered a disqualifying for Kavanaugh and that the European countries may not necessarily fit into that category so it's\nA will sort of have to see but this is all politics right I mean flakes assertion that that would be disqualifying will be absolutely heavily loving by the fact that he needs to consider what the politics are of the decision by the ... and so to the extent that we can say hey Kevin all said this thing about the yearbook which isn't exactly true\nWhat we are going to end up seeing inevitably and the evidence suggested this is what we're going to see is that people will simply say well yes that that's not really what I meant when I said that this would be disqualified\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that work greeters of Matt law that simulates software accelerating the pace of engineering and science you learn more and I met were not come\nFrom NPR and W.

is here and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement\nJoining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers welcome back to hear now\nGlad to be with your Germany\nAnd let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it\nNever seen so much ado about so little\nI thought the old trade regime between Canada Mexico in the United states was a good one and this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth\nMajor alienation of major allies I Can't imagine\nThese are relatively small changes the vast majority of NAFTA is continuing as it was\nThis has been a major diversion from the important domestic challenges facing the United states and the important international\nChallenges but I'm happy with the new agreement for simply because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are\nIll will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits\nThe ability of North America to remain unified when we face very serious challenges from Asia has been constrained\nThis has been the most ... short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nThink there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used to go after them have been quite problematic\nThey emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government\nThey encourage the Chinese sign a road to self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leverage and influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which has surely the most effective way to influence Chinese behavior\nI think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about Chinese trade practices and in particular the ones who are relating to intellectual property\nBut I don't think the strategy she wore the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China they're all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want\nTariffs our taxes they are taxes\nFall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs the companies need in order to compete\nThe inefficient and so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting\nFocusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes on uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being taxed cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican craven this in front of President Trump\nIs clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist buddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear\nOf a primary challenge sponsored and supported by President Trump\nAnd President Trump may not have a majority within America with him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline\nAnd therefore he is able to a rally Republican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions to stand by his side\nYou know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about centers who regarded their\nCore beliefs as being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well [noise]\nWhat do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to ...\nHe's likely to be a reversible error at any error in terms of tipping economy into recession is likely to take a very long time to reverse I'm One who believes that we have a very different to calm me than we used to\nTherefore I think the approach that's being pursued is okay and I would not be one ah to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do\nI I have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying\nThat the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence that at the end of expansions there's a tendency for productivity growth to slow\nAnd that may be for the reason you're a companion suggests that ah when laborers in short supply some of the people hire are a bit less a qualified\nBut it seems to me that what is striking is how slow\nAny pressure for inflation is and perhaps that's because of the price discipline posed by foreign competition posed a buy a technology so I think it would take quite a lot to generate a substantial acceleration in America and inflation\nI Want to ask you about one more thing which is that we're talking as the stock market is at record highs a lot of people are worried that you know we've been in an expansion for a long time now that the recession is on the way what are your thoughts at this point about that I'd\nSurprised if some time in the next three years we didn't have a recession evidence is that it's very hard to predict recessions and so the fact that we don't see one coming doesn't assure us that one is not coming\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and your NPR station staples with printers printer ink on toner

station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nHere and now and we've spoken here over the years about early retirement a couple of who sold their home traveling and staying in other people's homes to save money millennials who work day and night\nFor financial independence retire early and fire is on fire inspired in part by books like your money or your life and stoked on blogs podcast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent out all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nWell let's let Scott tell it he joins us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nHi thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast was one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete asked me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives you moved you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on that podcast\nThat was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about the stress as you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town and our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know ... my\nFinancial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as what was so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\nSo uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending\nAnd when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realize that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really liked my job and for me it's not about work for me it was about uh bring myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of days first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what'd you and your wife did just to keep the story going is it's a major part of this fire move and it's called arbitrage\nYou moved she had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you\nAre making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant true is that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels uh this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest breach to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can\nHealth insurance but the infamous yeah yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough that the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off\nRace one of the the main draws for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial advisor you're essentially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big Gibson dives\nAnd if you can ride those way that you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a nice entry point for me well\nIn part of this in order to do this as a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you we're absolutely miserable and we go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing\n[laughter] yeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know at a venture up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year we we actually ah we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents' house maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the air and space\nAnd by the way people have pointed out this isn't something he can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire with like one million one point two million one point five million invested\nI mean have you ever thought about that\nOf course we definitely have thought about that and that's something that you know we were definitely a nervous about an asked a lot about in the beginning\nAnd there was a couple of things about it I think the first thing is the whole premise of financial independence and your investments making enough that it can sustain you is based off of this thing called the trinity study and it essentially a works out the math to be about Ninety eight percent chance that you won't run out of your a principal a investments\nOver the course of Thirty years if you drop four percent off of that the idea is that the stock market continues to grow and if it continues to grow that has in the past and you can always sip a little bit off the top\nAnd you'll never run out of what you had ... at the end of the day one of my dear friends in one of my favorite uh you know fire pie casters her name is Paula ... we were asking her this question and she said you know the worst case scenario is you go back to work\nI think for us the real point here was gaining financial literacy and understanding how money works in our life and what our relationship to money is\nAnd once we saw it as a tool and something that we had more power over this the freedom and the stress or that was relieved", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "02"}
