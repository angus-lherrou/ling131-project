past six months journalists around the world have been working to finish the investigations Daphne started\nThanks to the nonprofit forbidden stories which continues the work of murder journalists and last week five members of the European Parliament calls to the European Commission to back an investigation into college is murder citing revelations from the forbidden stories work including\nThat the Maltese governments sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros\nWas enabling those Russians to enter European Union countries and carry out money laundering and other crimes\nLauren ... is founder and executive director of forbidden stories\nLow rent a you and other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Carolina ... was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were thanks to the world cup for forty five ripple does for about six months we were able to reveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the motives\nI learned and we were reading some concerning Fox about some potential links between the economy minister and some of the people who have been a rush to because they were triggering the boom there were you to really pushing the button pushing the button\nYeah they were using a cell phone that was connected to the bone under the calls for ... not good at Jones Day or she is shifting kill at least they are suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nTeam we were able to meet some people who told us that they have seen the communities to with\nThose two suspects before the murder\nAnd to the work of the ... project was not only about to identify who might be the key those but it's up to ... to reserve Daphne\nAnd to complete a very critical work because her stories was about sensitive issue like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to conflict with death name the name of that politic what's a definite project\nAgain you had a Maltese government she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have\nYou found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that's quite something look I I just want to back up and and talk about how this started because it's in a compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo off this tell us tell us about your experience there\nOn investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and um I used to travel a lot into 'em do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me will personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to start forbidden to reason this up and\nActually twenty Fifteen when to terrorists of al Qaida in Yemen arrive in the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in Paris\nAnd they into the ... and they killed ... newsroom were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address arrived to date two minutes after the terrorist escape the building\nAnd I into the news room and then I\nI was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just already dead and we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so this is really to really change my life because\nThis was happening in Paris this was not happening on the conflicts and he was such an Iraq was in the middle of pirates twice in my personal environment\nHe was a bold clicks I knew and we were doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... they were killed forced to read they were able to publish and so\nIt was really traumatic experience and it takes a lot of time\nOn that day had decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder to report to us to keep stories alive and usually when a journalist who's dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story is very relevant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep these stories of life\nAnd he said something so compelling they're usually when journalists get killed there on to something and so for you it's about figuring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murderers you can kill the messenger but you won't kill\nThe message the story look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter Don ... was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\n... a new organization sprung up it was called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work but there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work\nWe also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper or was attacked in so many killed threats were made against the Boston Globe by a California man he threatened to kill all of them do you\nDo you just there I mean it doesn't feel as if you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um we are really facing real threats not totally\nIn South America and not only in Mexico in Europe too\nIn a an old continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the\nIf the Cuba will see that there was a group of traumatized ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes then that will probably think twice the next time they will think about killing one report\nYou were talking about the origins project that's great and very inspiring project and I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send these poor full signal to the enemies of the press to kill the messenger you would never killed him his age because we are\nHere to make sure people to get access to this is very important stories so\nYes there was a lot of ... we need some support there a lot of children is to have been killed there are a lot of many forbidden stories beyond that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it's it's not just to a number ... ... important information that some people want to\nThere's an editor's there's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen when a of an investigative journalist with locked up in Azerbaijan\nA there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization I think it's a ... a B. R. A. J. I they continue the work of another reporter so\nThis has been going on this as you say collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among many reporters\nThat brings us to the Saudi journalist who wrote for among other papers the Washington Post ... um us and Turkish officials believe that he was murdered inside the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nHave you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what the story use he was ... he was walking on we need to to know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose lots of so that's a\nI Hope we get more information to build the disappearance of a of this um ... I Hope that we'll be able to get some information sold Uruguay is very difficult country to rock and\nSo he was a kind of voice very rare unique\nSo we we we ... we need that kind of ... and so we need to to work to get those went to look at what kind of stories he was publishing those pastures\nAnd one last thought I'm Wondering he said when you came upon your colleagues largely a cartoon is a satirical cartoonist from Charlie Hebdo who's been murder or were dying you said that you you said you could not get those images out of your head or\nHas the work that you're doing now has that he's that at all\nThat's a very good question I'm\nI'm not doing that for being able to forget those kinds of different kinds of teachers um [noise] but uh it's really helpful because I think that I wanted to do something as a journalist and so by doing that\nI think uh I can bring on the table the mice kills as investigative reporter to defend press freedom and I do think that journalism can defend journalism and that's\nKnow you you probably said to a friend or a date\nOr whoever it is I was listening to WB a gym and I heard blank\nThat's what it's all about it's the stories the news\nUm any insights that make you stop and think and start your own conversations and maybe they could save\nA bad date and turn it into a great date you know um we take the time to check facts and and and find the knowledgeable sources and and bring you reporting that's thorough and thoughtful that is what WB H M gives you that you just cannot get anywhere else it whatever that means to you\nTurn it into a dollar amount and don't wait call now eight hundred for for for nine two four six or online at W.

shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's it's just something that as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen it became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way\nJust to demonstrate what is happening is not normal and I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary\nAnd how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January\nTwenty first twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than the oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter] and I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that\nAnd uh the new president\nYou didn't even know what that tournament\nI didn't even know what that term men after you know I started oppose the war and then I heard the term shade and yeah and and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen the biggest crowd in history was really on January twenty two thousand nine\nHuge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it\nI mean I kind of picture says it all\nRight right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true yes I Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's very rarely is there\nA negative feedback in and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is uh my uh it's kind of followers are have my back and they they end up commenting back to these people and they often point out to me\nAre people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know if they're rushing bots but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just and saying what they want to say\nOr in this book I you've got a often either Trump tweets alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one I'm looking at right here\nA President Trump said on may six twenty

states can't be honest I mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf\n... and ... just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know tell me and she\nSpoke poke I guess what's the one that you're most proud of that you like I Can't believe I thought of that [noise]\nAh the the [laughter]\nI guess you know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps a ... in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter]\nAnd I and I found a a picture of a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he had more people at his inauguration and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other network and you Instagram\nForty eight million people watched the twenty tends to the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama's was a two thousand ten states union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff\n[laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one rocket man [laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in\nA coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nBut I think he knows when I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post among the ... you\nKnow these are all the pictures that were previously made public honoring the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama already or do you want to do something else [noise]\nNo I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come um\nBecause I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day um someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible access\nAnd I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could\nAnd and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened uh because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn\n'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nTeaches at one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone\nYou can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's really great photographs compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are great amateur photographers what is your one piece of advice that you give to people about how to take a better picture\nOh boy I'm\nPiece of advice I can I give to yeah sure [laughter] um\nFor here into comes from the listeners of WB or Boston or your NPR station from exact science is offering Colo guard forever ... over fifty an invasive colon cancer screening test that could be used at home like prescription Ollie information\nFor all of their families at assets would last will and living trust the state plans more information is available at legal zone dot com slash now\n\nIt's here and now should students ever be grouped by race this year the little red schoolhouse or progressive private school in Manhattan decided to end an experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room after the parents of the minority students objected\nPhilip Kaplan is director of the little red schoolhouse Philip first what was your thinking and trying this\nAh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement\n... well you said that a part of this was based on you know research this wasn't an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and if for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWill you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identities what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of the development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could\nSo you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids and I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced or having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experience in let's say the teachers are white and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects the minority students negatively it at home all the place where it's a much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those ins even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYeah this is an unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school\nHad its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines\nProbably the same reasoning that you were getting for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with but you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular\nIt just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I I'd say two things about that one if you're you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmates in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room and the ...\nThis is ludicrous you know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise] so what happens now a huge drop the homeroom experiment so how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what ... what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of the students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\nBy the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan [noise] uh where you have ended this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so lots of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd ... and director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan so thanks so much it's been a pleasure of tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educated who says there are times to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography award photographer Tom sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question I Choose to estimate the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I don't have to think about why I just that's how I Do my every ... ...\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe this as the camel often have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he saying job [laughter] it's called cutting the active uh from photographer marrying a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nLoud and is that any one of my favorites I think it was impossible just to see the animal and the ... I think ... the animal thinking something goes through your mind very quickly I have this vision of showing off isn't United her showing on your nails off a friend [laughter]\nWhich is why I Love this poem petition because actually the humidity is on different levels wherever you when\nYou see well yeah I got gel nails this time we [laughter] then we have that to a komodo dragons this is a photo by Sergei savvy is coal Martian [laughter] and their tails are whipping behind them and they're in an embrace and they do a little like a little Martian like\nThey do to motion like and I'm actually they shouldn't be cold committed dragging their their relatives of the ... what they uh I I think Bangor monitors but when you see them in that sort of embrace dumb thing they do not dumb thing on bracing the comedy fighting but\nIt kinda fits that temperament they all be friendly and sweet\nWell and they're probably you know they just got stuck together or something and they were signing tons to them that they are not thinking but that's a part of it if it's about anthropomorphizing some would say um there's the exasperated grizzly Danielle ... he just looks like a God behind you know what what next\nNo it it's an amazing thing these animals because the basis of the competition is to raise awareness of animals and the fact that\nNobody can we just wouldn't be around and when does he is and I think people are getting a bit tired of seeing sort of gruesome imagery associated with animal consideration so we just feel that if we can build a positive emotion than we may take the discussion slightly different direction\nNot well I tell you uh you'll have the winner of the competition in November to me this is more important than the world series um will have all the pictures and hearing now dot or for people to weigh in\nOr for you but you are the ones who have to help us uh in that effort and it is a it's a partnership it's teamwork\nBut this is the fund drive the time to give is right now don't put it off don't wait donate thank you ...
