so far\nThe latest addressed you senator Cory Booker into the former director of national intelligence James Clapper NPR's Quil Lawrence has been following this story Quil what do we know about the man who was arrested earlier today\nAh his name is ... uh fifty six years old he's from uh Ventura Florida just north of Miami\nOr possibly born in New York but has lived in Florida for several years he's a registered Republican he has a criminal history in Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One including\nA theft and fraud charges um and uh what's perhaps the most telling about him if uh the the media reports and the ... the pictures we've been seeing of his van are in fact his is just a a\nA a political manifesto written on the side of his white van in stickers or where he uh has a lot of references to vice president uh parents and of course President Trump or and also against George Soros\nI'm so I'm looking at his social media you can see that he's a very much involved in politics he tweeting about uh the governor's race against the Democratic candidate and Andrew Gillum down their\nPolice were said to have known about this man as you say he had a criminal past you know what it is that led to thirties directly to them\nThere had been uh some focus on Florida as where these packages had been mailed from a very quickly and a experts have been talking about the amount of evidence that might have\nPrints as well as possibly DNA I'm so authorities were were moving a very quickly on this and we're focusing on Florida and we can assume that they tracked from the the uh possibly from surveillance cameras at at the post office where they found that some of these packages might have been sent from but it's early days\nDo you have any idea and just how he was arrested or was he with the vehicle that um that they took away at the time was he considered dangerous when they arrested him\nWe know he was arrested at about eleven o'clock this morning in a parking lot of shopping center a plantation Florida which is just outside of Fort Lauderdale\nUm you know there was some street shutdown around there are and there was this white van which was towed away covering stickers ah people on social media have been tweeting\nPictures of the white van because it was such a a a noticeable vehicle or people who'd seen it in traffic and and taking pictures of it to send to their friends are now putting them up on social media so you can kind of a read into his character from what he displayed on his van\nPresident Trump a got word earlier today right after the arrest apparently and spoke about the investigation any arrest or when the president was at an event for the young black leadership someone at the White House this afternoon he was a part of what he said\nWe've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our

Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane our last guy I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a head into French forget shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was ...\nThat orbit to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of\nA undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out a there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles 'cause I'm digs are nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one or that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah I'm the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of San still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turned in the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands\nThat can be problematic because much of the ... area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turn to the north to some of the other ... there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... sand did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured that this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um\nIt would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence I\nThat's a dean intersected by hurricane but of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes to that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actual is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are that are also in danger or the other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice island uh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know that's just an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... since last year as hurricane season and twenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking uh with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by the hurricane to the north and north east the\nTrade when waves may push that sand back\nTowards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling\nSea level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming this island or don't exist\nThat ship Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yes thank you\nOn the conversation now with connections to climate is meant pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the pricing economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with ...\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more net GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shift about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less growth it what do we actually want from growth usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do a nice pair comparison right um they are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth states and India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution of means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talking about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nOr gets ... F trained in these like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so it's not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money is going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying it but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nThat you can think of to sort of a tendencies one is the sort of rise of of of sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with a democratic socialist America or other movements on that is a very important part of the conversation another would be very local organizations but with a ...\nOld a sort of ego um sustainable society from the ground up meaning what\nOh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic government they are trying to and they are succeeding in some ways to build\nA sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing um but that doesn't ignore these political and economic parts of the story right\nThat are trying to put really a democratic control as necessary medium through which this management as possible so that's a very a local a response um their national responses", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "26"}
