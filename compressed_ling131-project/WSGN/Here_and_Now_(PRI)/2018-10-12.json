a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for their immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story former welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is\nMade of bed sheets in Fifteen cells\nHow is that possible uh well that's a good\nAnd you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of were issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago a man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts\nUsing a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this\nAnd Vance and so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nTo shoot we imply then that that many people inside the facility were suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those who says\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would on for all the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed at them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside the building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\nYou know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a ... questions of untimely an adequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper an overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they called civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to\nHappen and so when you're using disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned but doctors stamped their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth\nI'm is what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\nDetention is governed by ah what are called his performance space national detention standards and that governs everything about medical care that\nDetainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be timely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who are have no choice but to rely on the care that they're given inside these facilities and in Adelanto\nThat's an eleven the facility has failed to meet the standards of this is not the first time that that this has been an issue\nWe should point out that I Belong to is owned by a private company the GEO Group and it's it's very very common for the federal government to contract these detention centers out\nTo private companies you mentioned they have a history of problems um what is that companies saying I I mean is anybody being held to account for what the inspector general found\n[noise] um the company uh initially did not respond when we did our our story about the office of inspector general's report but after that they did a send me a statement saying that they took the a report very seriously\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and your NPR station from posters Smith printing

video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi constantly ...\n... you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the constantly more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia\nThe BBC's mark low in joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nI Do it at a source close to touch investigation said turkey has gone documents that evidence to support the claim of state sponsored murder of ... she went into the Saudi consulates in Istanbul ten days ago\nAnd this also said tells us that um and of course official position is still that I'm ... is missing about that a tax intelligence knows for sure that he was mud\nI'm not a backstop the American news reports and all that audio and video a video evidence the recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that and they're very gruesome details coming out including a recordings allegedly of him being beaten\nI'm On some reports are that his body was just men but I'm the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still slap lead to knowing all the allegation how reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence\nUm I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this is not strange communication strategy with this government\nYou have a ... communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moment teachers that the Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach is that for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here to be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation\nOr the Saudis have proposed that is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't wanna blow apart after my relationship at this stage but they all lead King I'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that forced tightening the screws on the Saudis and trying to get the ... western backing for the Tucker's position the question about that joint committee\nThe Saudi Turkish investigation has to be how credible it can be if it includes the Saudi Government\nYeah and I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint suddenly the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of um a a diplomatic nice city on the parts of the tax entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have got the evidence to back up their espresso allegation\nAnd there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or are people noting that at all the biggest\nJailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by tequila ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at a key is not treating journalists in the same way as there is a journalist is alleged to be treated you know that it's not even know murdering hey we're talking about\nUh how ... locked up journalist which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on a liberal values but but uh yeah there is some distance between the two cases I think\nHere in our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there in his stumble how much is this case threatening the diplomatic order in the across the region well I think that turkey is very aware\nThat it that you know the racial Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage bought a I think that you know clearly he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its sovereignty ate it won't support from the U.S and from other western governments in and taking a tough line\nTowards the towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by\nYou can see him ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in the ... the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not interfere with the independence of the tech is traditionally which is seen as laughable bike by critics of of tacky and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which basically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S um and uh it was the source of must've friction between the U.S and and ... governments\nAt sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack US Currency ah that is when I expected to east to some extent\nAnd it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's mark alone in Istanbul thank you so much pleasure\nNow back to the U. S. where a candidate in Georgia is hotly contested governor's race has been hit with a federal lawsuit Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running for governor and he was sued yesterday by groups that say his office is jeopardizing the votes of some minority residents\n... campaign denies that it did anything wrong but his opponent Democrat Stacey Abrams is calling on him to resign as secretary of state\nJonathan breeder is counsel with the Brennan Center for justice is Democracy Program at the nonpartisan group that advocates for voting rights Jonathan thanks for joining us\nThanks for having the reporting is that camps office stole the registrations for fifty three thousand mostly black and Hispanic voters based on a law known as exact match what can you tell us about that\nExact matches the policy by which if all the information on the voter registration form down to the digital hype and doesn't match perfectly with the existing data in driver's license for Social Security information the voter registration form is put on hold and in some cases rejected entirely\nDo most people on that list I Know that they've been excluded\nThey're supposed to get a notice in the mail but oftentimes people don't receive those are understanding what they need and so the burden is and placed on the voter to fix this problem which in other states would not affect their eligibility or voting at all\nSo in total comes off as a secretary of state has canceled nearly a million and a half voter registration since ...\nAnd that it has never been easier to vote in Georgia um what what do you make of that are you aware of any voter fraud problem in Georgia on a significant level\nThere's no significant evidence of voter fraud in Georgia and although voter list maintenance is important there's no connection between aggressively purging the voter rolls the way Georgia has in making things more secure at\nCamp is also a putting a fair amount of the blame here on Stacey Abrams his Democratic opponent\nShe started a voter registration group in two thousand and Thirteen called the New Georgia project in camp is making the point that in the process of signing\nThousands of people up through that project they did a sloppy job and that he was just pulling out those improper registrations I mean it does Stacey Abrams in her group deserve any blame for maybe doing this in in a poor fashion\nVoter registration drives our a vital lifeline to get certain communities who don't have as much access to government offices registered to vote if there is information missing or sometimes happens\nThe states should do everything they can to resolve those discrepancies with Georgia is doing is making it the voters burden to resolve that problem instead of trying to fix it themselves [noise] do\nYou think a candidate who's running for governor can independently also be the secretary of state\nWhile it's happened before and other states I don't think this is a unique situation I think that one of the concerns is that as secretary of state or Mr camp has made\nSome controversial statements there was a statement he made several years ago expressing dismay about some voter registration drives and he's been accused of politically motivated investigation so that's certainly a concern in Georgia specifically\nAnd just to be fair I Want to add something else that campus said he says the Georgia has broken a record this year for voter registrations with nearly seven million new voters added to the rules I Want to also ask you to expand this beyond Georgia how common are exact match laws around the country\nThere's a couple of states that have some version for example Florida has a version of this but they will go back and look at the voter registration form and try to resolve the difference before they put it back on the voter ... and put them the voters are at risk and and give them the responsibility to fix the problem", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "12"}
