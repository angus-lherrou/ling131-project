C. A. actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing providers drop out of the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health care\nWhat about what we just saw with Brett Kavanaugh how do you feel about how the Senate handled his confirmation\nIn bed and create hearing the United states the people of this country should not have been dragged into that I don't think it did anything to unite us it created a lot of chaos and dysfunction one\nOf the things that some voters know about you here in orange county is that your husband was caught up in a pond [noise] what do you want people to know about that and and do you think that they should be judging you on that at all [noise]\nNumber one that's a lie there with no Ponzi schemes so I Want to set the record clear there were allegations in litigation from two thousand nine that declared\nEverything it was simple it was never a criminal litigation that was a civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make it and it went through a jury trial\nSo I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently liked to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen do you think that that's hurting you know in this race\nWell if you can't defend yourself it does but I got the ... actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it it's on my website I tell the story I tell what happened it was two thousand eight [noise]\nAnybody involved in real estate understand the problems in two thousand eight the bank folded a\nProperty ... it was it was miserable and Mr Leavenworth for countrywide and he says there's an excuse for for closing on people but he was always a brand new brand new attorney and the crew and and they get the brand new guys these kind of dirty jobs to do\nWhat do you think the biggest issue is for voters in his district this year I think the dysfunction in DC [noise]\nYou know the news is she started than teach meant hearings and all this chaos going on they don't if you don't want politics they want some results [noise]\nDiane Harkey Republican running for Congress here thank you so much thank you\nHockey's opponent is the guy she was just talking about a lawyer and first time candidate Mike Lebanon we met him at his campaign office in San Clemente and I asked him why he's running\nWell for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns I've never felt compelled to run a before myself\nA after having been very involved in a twenty sixteen election now to help Secretary Clinton uh in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided uh what good is our background or experience\nAnd uh if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county [noise]\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent uh people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm not running on an impeachment platform I Do want to get to the truth\nI Want to see justice and ultimately I Want to see a a a an investigation by Mr Mahler or that or is not politicized\nOr what we have seen with Devon noon as as chair of the house intelligence committee is the withholding of relevant testimony and information and you know the other side\nYou know they're they're making us to be out and be be some are angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches due to an arsonist couldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law there cannot be one set of rules for the president added states in one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders or you know created this a democratic\nRepublic that we live in our constitution still matters\nYou bring up the line about the angry mob how much do you think that what just happened with Brett Kavanaugh has changed the dynamics of your race has it energized Republicans more energized Democrats more than they were before\n[noise] well I have no idea all I Know is that um you know yesterday day before we have an extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice cabinet or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to ah just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will out work the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been dragging her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie what do you think\nUm I think the victims ah deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple ah her husband a endpoint center of financial was found by both the uh jury as well as a a judge and then an appellate court to be a Ponzi scheme to be financial fraud and\nEx husband or they have not paid a nearly enough to those victims\nShe also ah in her answer to our question about that tried to connect you to countrywide I which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working for bank of America which you own country wide and I'd have to to do with that\nNot at all she's tried to create false equivalence between uh you know the serious misconduct of her husband were talking about major financial fraud\nOr in my work I as an attorney I'm proud of my work as an attorney I've tried to do the right thing I've tried to stand up for people in the record is on my side in my case uh there was a very unscrupulous attorney a guy named Mitchel Roth\n\nFunding for here and now

fastest growing ethnic group in this state they now make up more than fourteen percent of the population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county where there are four congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive\nIt's about eight hundred thousand of right now we are over twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI see it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community is foreign born escorting to the sense that that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rise of second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim is principal and CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Hall the former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nPrison ration tends to vote Republican and my ... your friends are more in the Democratic side why is that maybe it's because of a little bit of ...\nOf Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why the Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption the government the distrust of government and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nLot of this Korean Americans I grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in an urban areas and I think that's part of the process or in urban areas tend to focus more progressive thinking than more the conservative suburban ideals\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nIn the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here through chain migration so\nAnd the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration system so it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nOf a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country\nWould definitely be the my friends I mean more democratic or liberal Republicans are progressive Republicans I myself have have definitely some qualms about that key issue\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like tan and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon sunny told us the politics here are shifting [noise]\nDefinitely changing I I think in you know you look at generation one which is our parents um and and I we we're all one point fights and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so\nReally trust the government so stay away from it so we came over here you see a lot of all this is a family cash only pay you know what you don't want to say what we our own strategies and we don't want to share best practices because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why for generations that are known\nTo be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew in\nYou know and being an American or you know and having it includes city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do collaborate and we're showing 'em or first Gen our parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing a best practice we actually sharing best practices that entrepreneur Z\nAnd they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences from generation one enters into\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to this country we can make on me and that because we wanted handout that because we wanted the opposite genie America provided to see it on our own\nYoung fume praised by the ... the register for her consistent record opposing tax increases in fighting for fiscal responsibility young Kim for Congress\nThere hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex camp\nWe have young Kim of course local year with Pearl Kim and also I'm Andy Kim and may not related not related but all you know Kim is a very popular name a Korean Americans and a quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this connection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American including us right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat or Republican I Would like to see a Korean American on there to represent\nAnd do it you know I see myself especially as a business owner the community as a Vietnamese American first before\nBeing part of the party of those Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment Marion food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education housing\nAsian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you know where you really from or where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get it or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what languages do you speak and I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish I'm and I'm you know my family's been here for so long\nThat it it's those types of questions we always get it and so it makes people feel that\nThey're not really accepted or they're not really American so what do you think that means for the upcoming election\nI think it's really important to show as Asian Americans how crucial we are to civic engagement and how important it is for us to vote and have a voice but also how important it is to educate\nA the general public about the issues that we find are of concern or that we feel are important and so to really talk about our values\nAll of that is to say the politicians from both parties have a lot to gain from these\nAsian American communities in orange county or politicians paying attention to Asian American voters you think [noise]\nI think they have to and so I think those who have it in the past are now and I think many of the ones who are more savvy or have known how important the Asian American vote is and how and why we\nWe tend to vote as a block and so I think they see the impact that can be made by really learning about the issues of concern now\nIn the news generally there have been a number of Asian countries that have been right at the center of what's going on you got the situation in North Korea you've got the trade war now with China how does that play\nI think people because of the other of their country of origin and seeing

[noise]\nNow you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see\nAnd I don't that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and uh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start from our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states off so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually hurt me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also\nHe was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement and really how they can improve their responses for the victims side [laughter] I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them\nSomeone sing issues alone would make people assume they were bad\nI recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during that shooting and after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know do do I thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nWhat are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot\nTwice I think they expect to see someone\n... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and to save the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually that's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke of us have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nNow I I it's so frustrating to me and it just always seems\nThat at the ease of obtaining weapons here but especially the the weapons like the air fifteens and these\nWeapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting is a made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that there are so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon\nAnd do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done anytime soon unfortunately now\nThe giving you to help you recover a star of hope at a medal given to you after the attack by one of your nurses\n[noise] do you still have those things yes and actually I'm Dexter the nurse I presented him with the star of hope\nNine two four six or visiting us on line at W.

Scott\nHey Jeremy and with me in the studio at Cape BCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent\nFor K. PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom a Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate\nThis week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento or the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls just Cox have a chance well\nIt's tough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate or decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter\nConservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough place California is for Republicans to win statewide\nIf new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm kind of her brand has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and using indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues a nuisance support sanctuary cities for example he backs California coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has\nAnd one of those areas as early childhood\nAnd during the recession the funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as loud as\nWell as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump or the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think the government's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know\nProperty in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property in California\nThe taxes are way way out of whack and [noise] it was such a move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California and then doing\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem and these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI forwarded melody homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races\nAnd you know they're just issues I'm affordability that I think a lot of these a new party preference and others at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some that said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ...\nAh maybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nUh you know I think Kevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nOr and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo ah and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this Kavanaugh fingers playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know it's I haven't seen\nBut one thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were ...\nAbout it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California on daily and arguments are certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we were you bind or rewind back to twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California and\nMany of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race but as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability refined sign\nA so we'd be watching this ahead she seems to have a pretty substantial cushion right now ah but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls\nWell that's what Republicans were hoping Jeremy they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular\nAs you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive\nA no one's particularly happy about having to pay and it's about uh twelve cents per gallon tax but it generates five billion dollars a year for transportation roads bridges highways and so the no on sex campaigns done I think a pretty good job of saying they're trying to take away money to keep our highways and our infrastructure in good shape\nNine two four six or go online to WBAI Jim dot\nO.

people to come to California because a high cost of living in taxation do you think the Daryl I thought it was part of that dysfunction in Washington\nI'm Darryl than I have a totally different approaches to governing I'm more of a consensus builder [noise] I like I worked across the aisle and California and many times I wasn't a minority party and that was the first\nAnd are you with President Trump because you do have is indoors [noise]\nWell there's a lot so I like on the ... and the economic front\nUnlike a lot on the economic front I'm not a fan of the approach he's kind of got the good cop bad cop in reverse\nGenerally the elected the person is the softer touch a but he's kind of frontal and I think it makes it a difficult to people understand I think in this district because we're not used to that kind of approach but I think the result she's gotten on the budget a tax reform\nHas really help this district help the states where do you disagree with Trump [noise]\nWell I would've liked to have seen a lot of like to have seen a little bit more a provision for California in our tax reform on the salt treatment but that really wasn't him that was the Congress [noise] I think that um [noise]\nI I think more in the mannerisms and also I I'm not for offshore drilling I think California has a beautiful coastline we don't want that and say healthcare we have we have to do something about the health care health care right now in California is\nOkay but Medicaid funding that we've accepted a lot of is driving providers out in the market because it's the state is pulling back on the on the reimbursement rates very very difficult for some people are the AC a actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing providers drop out of the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health care\nWhat about what we just saw with Brett Kavanaugh how do you feel about how the Senate handled his confirmation\nI thought it was hard core politics I didn't like it it should have all been bed and create hearing the United states the people of this country should not have been dragged into that I don't think it did anything to unite us it's created a lot of chaos and\nDysfunction one of the things that some voters know about you here in orange county is that your husband was caught up in a pond [noise] what do you want people to know about that and and do you think that they should be judging you on that at all [noise]\nNumber one that's a lie there was no Ponzi scheme so I Want to set the record clear\nThere were allegations in the litigation from two thousand nine that declared everything it was simple it was never a criminal litigation that was a civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make a day and it went through a jury trial\nYou have no record to run on frequently likes to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen do you think that that's hurting you know in this race\nWell if you can't defend yourself it does but I got the ... people actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it it's on my website\nI tell the story I tell what happened it was to sound said hey anybody involved in real estate understands the problems in two thousand eight the bank folded a properties\nWe're seeing it was it was miserable and Mr Leavenworth for countrywide and he says there's an excuse for for closing on people but he was brand new brand new attorney and the group and and they get to a brand new guy is kind of dirty job to do\nWhat do you think the biggest issue is for voters in his district this year\nI think the dysfunction in DC [noise] you know the this started than teach meant hearings and all of this chaos going on if they don't want politics they want some results [noise]\nDiane Harkey Republican running for Congress here thank you so much thank you\nHockey's opponent is the guy she was just talking about a lawyer and first time candidate Mike Lebanon we met him at his campaign office in San Clemente and I asked him why he's running\nWell for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns I've never felt compelled to run a before myself\nOr after having been very involved in twenty sixteen election or to help Secretary Clinton\nOr in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children or if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now how\nMuch of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent of people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm not running on an impeachment platform I Do want to get to the truth I Want to see justice and ultimately I Want to see a a a an investigation by Mr Miller a that is not politicized or what we have seen with Devon\nAnd you know the other side you know they're they're making us to be out and be be some are angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches due to an arsonist couldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law there cannot be one set of rules for the president added states in one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders of you know created this a democratic\nRepublic that we live in our constitution still matters\nYou bring up the line about the angry mob how much do you think that what just happened with Brett Kavanaugh has changed the dynamics of your race has it energized Republicans more energized Democrats more than they were\nBefore [noise] well I have no idea all I Know is that um you know yesterday day before we have an extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice cabinet or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to ah just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will out work the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been dogging her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie what do you think\nUm I think the victims ah deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple ah her husband a endpoint center financial was found by both the uh jury as well as a a judge and then an appellate court to be a Ponzi scheme to be financial fraud\nAnd dozens of seniors were defrauded out of millions and millions of dollars and her husband her ex husband or they have not paid nearly enough to those victims\nShe also ah in her answer to our question about that tried to connect you to country wide I which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working for bank of America which owned countrywide and I'd nothing to do with that\nAt all she's tried to create false equivalence between uh you know the serious misconduct of her husband were talking about major financial fraud\nOr in my work as an attorney I'm proud of my work as an attorney I've tried to do the right thing I've tried to stand up for people in the record is on my side in my case uh there was a very unscrupulous attorney a guy named Mitchel Roth who was this\nIf you do your listeners will step up and support the public radio station that
