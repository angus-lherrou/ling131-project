G A ... and of course we remember and Trump just set it right there trumps the U.S has a big relationship economically and politically with Saudi Arabia\nIt's incredibly important I mean one of the things that's been quite disturbing to me over the last couple of years is how the president has pulled America back from some of its international relationships but then also pulled back from talking about American values when you go around and that's why I spent a lot of time earlier my career\nTraveling the globe and half of the governmental baffled private orders\nTo help ride to the rescue I just think if you're working for an international organization in some part of the world to you don't feel that level of security may have felt six months ago ... was a U.S rosy\nWith Alice how would you advise working\nAll he was also looking for an American newspaper\nWhich President Trump eight he hates that newspaper the Washington matter right well there you go but em but Alice how how would you advise Republicans at this moment of the crown prince\nHad had other moments you know he was detained um Saudi billionaires in a hotel there are the war in Yemen there's a war in Yemen um here's Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends just yesterday about Mohammed then selling\nThis guy's got to go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his tainted your country and painted himself\nAnd Alice is this painting Trump because there's a whiff of the fact that he has personal relations with the Saudis his son in law and daughter you know have potential business deals with them and that's it he's starting to feel like it's a more personal than for the good of the country for human rights\nRobin unfortunately it feels as though there's a little bit more than a whiff of connection between the president and the the first family and\nUh the Saudi officials which is a big concern I I Do think is critical for us to get all of the information before we up making a big declarations I Wish there was a little bit more of a Lindsey Graham and Donald Trump when he's talking about the situation in the\nFire and fury that we we do here ... and Lindsey Graham's voice\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W.

created the memorable dances and rules Peter Pan the king and I\nBut a new book\nMakes the case that these populist teases kept Robbins from assuming his proper place in dance\nThat because he was regarded as one of the twentieth century the most powerful storytellers is too low brow for the more abstract will the twenty second tier doors down the great Russian born choreographer and cofounder of the New York city ballet\nWho hired thirty one year old Robbins in Nineteen forty nine to be that companies is\nDuty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when you lesser welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write it to that I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because your own Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing of them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the one hundreds centennial of John Robbins birth\nCertainly knew about his works as we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the journal Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course the music from Bach let's just listen to a little\n\n\n... you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you know the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nThirty dancers and all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week [noise] and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan manned fiddler on the roof men but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because there was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had panned and did she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise]\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called you and Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up from Robbins worth as a ballet choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much as well as we can hear now that word afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of DC I'm willing to do the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina tend to feel a click penny\nRobbins muse and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\n\n\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise]\nWell I I just loved the stats and it's only about ten minutes\nYou can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful Everytime [noise] it's\nThe very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has priest is is dancing around them and stuff but he's practically\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a do at [noise]\nWonderful do it I think we're it simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fun and his dream girl who come and\nVisit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the clip and ... was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves into practice mirror\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in a mere as\nDancers sometimes do in the studio said that there's this weird feeling\nOf we're spying on them in a way [noise]\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had applied he was Balanchine loved dances at a gathering which Robbins made and down she\nSaid it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat it the whole thing endlessly popcorn\nAnd that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but luckily little dances at a gathering this is the dance Robin Hood to Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing choreography for Broadway but this stance is at a gathering was an instant hit [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day [noise]\nDance to the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage after\nMany many minutes I you know it's quite a long ballet of all the dancers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside\nWatching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon on a combination of\nA work that meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n... [noise] uh you talked about his childhood which is\nThere's a famous and dancer whose story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to the audience that companies in front of him he's backing up backing up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the orchestra pit and no one comes to help them\nUm see he you know can be cruel\nYes and ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was and not just of the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing west side story in Washington in a theater and Leonard Bernstein was sitting there near the front of the theater listening to the play his music\nFrom college vine where consultants work with high school

this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis is here and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty six team\nAt the appropriate time I will Louis though but right now I'm under routine order nobody cares deal and cares is you know you and the few people that us in question obviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI call on the German annoys me just stop delaying it get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now\nHigh Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner um but it can important agents such as a staffer outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be ...\nThe committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house is not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtain drew the full house or the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote the committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with his this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because uh the committee has oversight over the tax function\nOr the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns and you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out\nBeyond that obviously there have been stories or the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing prior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest\nThe New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think I could come up with some very\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOr the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress in the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials of the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns\nAnd because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge in ... that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them\nFrom them well that's\nA tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think of some policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut it gives President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be\nFairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the decisions and is there some personal or business interest\nOn the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that all that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income\nYeah although I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the member of the public might think of that is you know how rich you are and and how much and so forth\nBecause a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income\nAnd so uh the return may not really show I mean it may show a relatively modest amount of taxable income and in fact as you say it may show little or no taxes paid\nUnless we have um we have made seven\nCalls for the for the gold that we had of twenty but\nWe can close that gap I I Know that we could do that in the next five minutes if you call in right now yes you coming back from your

direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that [noise]\nAnd one of the state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went down\nInitially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host and learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them and one person a region to another\nAnd ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but settled on twelve a who stories\nI decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that\nAt least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened and\nYou talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple related will speak like huge big league or big league may have turned up voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earned county but I think people\nBase most of their vote 'em for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level a how likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settled on a generally like Trump on most issues but really liked his style they just like today is uh is moxie his feisty and that's how we get up every morning and I'm as a tweet storm\nAnd a six to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in ... county who\nHe's going to beef up the wall yeah\nInteresting they talked about the importance of deep coating Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him\nAnd would treat him or to literally by merely covering a what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the practice job candidate says something in the press is supposed to report it\nAnd they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise] what\nAbout religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote\nSo I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\n... and does she feel like he's delivered she does he's appointed\nEvangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical\nThey're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nThat he's been married three times they don't care for them the I think the the most important issues are abortion and his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices what\nAbout just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county even if you\nDon't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and\nAnd uh thinks that it's an enormous problem and is trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain is not a lot of opportunity beyond maintenance and I'm working in warehouses a minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nGoing up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care about\nWhat about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to\nDo they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did um\nThere's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like lives there and county well they certainly did and\nThe twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats a lot of the people that I talked to were Democrats but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms\nWell if I had to guess I Would think the um this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats do we take the house but not the Senate\nThen by the junior one of the things I really\nBut who voted for Trump but did so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the um reporting even on people in the middle of the country that's coming from reporters and and and others on the coasts tests to look down on on them you didn't do that here\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students said it smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\n... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise] um I think it was well intentioned\nAnd certainly there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about\nWhat is happening for these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise] it seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening\nOne of the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be ...\nWhat does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing the stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed\nOn them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThan you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a\nHigher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation we'd end\nRacially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that\nBecause there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed in those upper attracts you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nBut to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that still not be placed so what do we do about how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some\nOr again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white school\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's this sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you write another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school\nA majority white and the teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to see how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that and the teachers get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like that there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically and also they became more engaged socially\nWhy what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things\nBus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and and be more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study um they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era\nAnd some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting and so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about in the brief it's soda so to speak\nIn that um time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asked why the white kids in the cafeteria\nTheir bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nJust such an odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedians they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young blacks to see that\nWell it's true I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to the music becomes mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by white teens as well as kids of color um those are physical symbols\nEight hundred for for for nine two four six or donate online\nAnytime at WBAI ... dot org while you're there and check out some of the thank you gifts we have to offer as well uh we

G A ... and of course we remember and Trump just said it right there trumps the U.S has a big relationship economically and politically with Saudi Arabia\nIt's incredibly important I mean one of the things that's been quite disturbing to me over the last couple of years is how the president has pulled America back from some of its\nInternational relationships but then also pulled back from talking about American values when you go around and that's why I spent a lot of time earlier my career traveling the globe and half of the government on behalf of private organizations\nAnd you know I always felt the security that if something happened to me the United states government would be there to help rise to the rescue I just think if you're working for an international organization in some part of the world today you don't feel that level of security you may have felt six months ... was a U.S rather\nWell but Alice how would you advise working all he was also looking for an American newspaper which\nPresident Trump pace he hates that newspaper the Washington shouldn't matter right legal but em but Alice how how would you advise Republicans at this moment of the crown prince\nHad had other moments you know he was detained um Saudi billionaires in a hotel there are the war in Yemen there's a war in Yemen um here's Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends just yesterday about Mohammed been selling\nGuy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting\nAnd Alice is this painting Trump because there's a whiff of the fact that he has personal relations with the Saudis his son in law and daughter have potential business deals with them and that's it he's starting to feel like it's more personal than for the good of the country for human rights\nRobin unfortunately it feels as though there is a little bit more than a whiff of connection between the president and the the first family and\nUh the Saudi officials which is a big concern I I Do think is critical for us to get all of the information before we up making a big declarations I Wish there was a little bit more of a Lindsey Graham in Donald Trump when he's talking about the situation in the\nFire and fury that we we do here ... and Lindsey Graham's voice\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W.

who also created the memorable dances and rules Peter Pan the king and I [noise]\nWhen the new book\nMakes the case that these hockey was teases kept Robbins from assuming his proper place in the sense\nThat because he was regarded as one of the twenty century the most powerful storytellers is too low brow for the more abstract world of twenty second tier Jewish balance this weight Russian born choreographer and cofounder of the New York city ballet who\nHired a thirty one year old Robbins in Nineteen forty nine to be that companies associate artistic director\nAuthor Wendy lesser says she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins\nHer new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when the lesser welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write a tidbit I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because Jerome Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing none of them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan\nIn that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the one hundreds centennial of Joe Robin ... birth\nCertainly knew about his work says we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the Germans Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course the music from Bach let's just listen to a little\n\n[noise]\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story fleet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nQuarterly friendly formal it was just\nAn amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box Goldberg variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week [noise] and then I thought\nSomething's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof men but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about\nThat that's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had\nReally do ballet although Balanchine never thought that [noise]\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both\nMentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crochet had panned and that she was the most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise] uh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called germ Robbins affects all angry man that was later but\nYou became as you write like a court appointed lawyer [laughter] you were going up Robbins worth as a ballet choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much as well as we can hear now that word afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of DC I'm willing to the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina ten ... tiny\nRobbins muse and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\n\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise]\nWell I I just love the stats and it's only about ten minute\nYou can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful Everytime [noise] it's not just a reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has a priest is is dancing around and stuff but he's practically\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a ... [noise]\nWonderful to ... I think we're at simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fun and his dream girl who comes in visit him and\nWith those two dancers tend to kill the ... was it was a knockout and what are they they're like they're watching themselves in a practice mirrors that is what it feels like and we are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in the mirror as dancers sometimes do in a studio\nSelf never took the superior attitude toward things that had a plot he was Balanchine loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and Balanchine said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly popcorn\nAnd that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but luckily little dances\nAt a gathering this is a the dance Robin Hood to Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing choreography for Broadway but this stance is at a gathering was an instant had\n\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day\nDance the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ended up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage after many many minutes I you know it's quite a long ballet of all the answers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen\nStand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon on\nA combination of a work that's meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n... a huge talked about his childhood which was difficult ... relationship with his mother\nUm and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to the audience\nThe companies in front of him he's backing up backing up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the orchestra pit and no one comes to help him\nUm he you know can be cruel\nAnd ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult it was and not just to the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing west side story in Washington in a theater and Leonard Bernstein was sitting there near the front of the theater listening to the play his

as the question\nObviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German and ways and means just stopped delaying it get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now\nHigh Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee shared to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after\nThe full house or the full Senate and presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote the committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of reasons um could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with his this is a tax committee and so it certainly could be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function\nOr the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out\nBeyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing prior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a fall there\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest\nThe New York times also raises the possibility of fraud and that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nSo it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about and we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOr the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties uh there were a variety of reasons to principle one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch including the\nTo ... uh the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nAh there was a similar concern or about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress's mind\nAh the the the Coolidge in ... in that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing industry ration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them\nThat people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what do we really going to learn from them well that's a tough question because obviously it depends\nOn what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think of some policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nIf President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it it it also might not prove anything\nIt came about more as in terms of character simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be\nFairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the decisions and is there some personal or business interest\nOn the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that all that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income yeah\nAlthough I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the member of the public might think of that is you know how rich you are and and how much and so forth\nBecause a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income\nAnd so are the return may not really show I mean it may show a relatively modest amount of taxable income and in fact as you say may show little or no taxes paid", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "17"}
