power could be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached some of the Tadic Rodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana\nWhere there were three deaths\nAnd Ronnie a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we took a direct hit it hit a shooting at a cat three location for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm hold a lot of places and people realized that this story does affect people that deep\nWhen you've got stolen this magnitude movie as fast as it did it all together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you to understand your home was hit\nBasically over pressurized and blue part of my roof often we're hoping to get some some adjusted on it today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and\nIf it's the damage is it just off the scales that and buildings down almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that it used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser Carlin the cocktail the Tampa Bay to be in that she guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county we damage she's using tax will have an aerial pictures and say is that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus ... completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr with Gulf Power spokesperson said this to restore that had to rebuild the entire electrical grid and Rena stand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were tone do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could has been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to trim back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWell what what are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that the rising is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run between towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood it's just they were so much debris down they could not get back\nThey look you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to fund a study on storm response failed in the state legislature and twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level of emergency convening on what to do going forward\n[noise] we're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike I ask you run and just briefly um does they're all have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI Love your show which climate change is it is is just a natural process occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their metal saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me and my level is not a course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things like it almost guarantee you this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very much\nA part of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season so we want to take a closer look with here now resident Jeff ... who is in the studio Hi Hi Robyn you know I have to say I'm One of those people I Love pears I think they are an art form I have pear cookbooks pictures of pairs\nAll I Do is use them and salads we blue cheese your whole pair world this is about to get blown out of the parking and says I Love writing okay well the most common one that we see in\nGrocery stores is that on Jew or mans you um there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're gonna find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most or all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are somewhat if not completely interchangeable how the dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned\nCrunchy very tart sweet also these are best eaten raw Timmy and Asian pair tastes like a pair and meeting with a water chestnut ... it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juice scene is and\nWonderful and salads wonderful graded also Bartlett another very common for a ride him very sweet red and green as well they are Chris ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also ... pairs same deal very earthy flavor and boss parents have any long gated neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have one of ... we did it seems so hard\nI'm really glad you said that because I Am going to absolutely show you how wrong you are okay All right here's what I did your reading I peeled the pair but I kept the stem on yeah okay I peeled it have you with me naked naked ... I took a couple of sugar\n... and a couple of white wine and two cups of water and I boil them ... I could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that\nI let it cook down that's called the simple syrup mhm\nI place my naked as you call them pairs into the syrup and I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the pair releases its juice into the syrup\nAnd the pair than cooks in this week delicious ginger syrup it can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup you can do that for breakfast and you could eat that as part of a salad\nBut you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing\n... right now\nBut the other thing about Paris is that they swing both ways they're savory and they're also clearly sweet [laughter] so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than than normal pear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use a\nBartlett pair my peel did I put a tiny bit of olive oil salt and pepper on it and I roasted it in little wedges and then I have fresh spinach and fall greens\nAnd I put my roasted pear around it then I took some French bread or bad get toasted in thin slices and spread blue cheese on top and I ...\nIn tart pungent from the blue cheese\nAnd sweet and ... she was from the ... oh and there's also sun dried cranberries seasonal specialty in the vein of grad okay we have this what is this this is an upside down\n... that you've probably heard of upside down pineapple again and it's very similar I used to variety I use comments I use a um\nFor a rally pair which are smallish that means trout in German and it's got a wonderful from ... flavor and then I also used a ... pair so I melted some butter and brown sugar and let that cook and then I laid the parents down in that and I made a very simple cake batter using all these spaces\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Corrine maybe not a household name but some think it should be and that's where we turn for this week's DJ session a ba Corrine edition\nFifty drama is hosting plastic mornings W. I. L. L. in Urbana, Illinois Dick welcome back\nJeremy it's great to be back thank you and you wanted us to start with the menu at from the string quintet in e major this is played by the Smithsonian Chamber Players [noise]\n\n\n\nFamiliar to know this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killers about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they said it\nThat is in a lot of movies since that tell us about it\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... have in the day throughout his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century\n... they were arrangements that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA mandolin for piano for saxophone for ... choir with a Latin text added so this piece has been popular well before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killers and the use in the film\nThis is a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola shallow was an additional cello no there's a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola\nAnd not with a cello somebody should've been onto this and that those guys are walking around without a second child list\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is Ferris wheel or stay off this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago and try to get in whether or not supposed to be but it's it's been in a lot or\nI Want to listen to actually to another version of the same piece this is the saint Paul chamber orchestra with Bobby McFerrin conducting an on vocals [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou know when I said Bobby McFerrin on vocals I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have it he's not singing necessarily it but he is a humming along to the to the tune\nBobby McFerrin is being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating arrangement of it for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string Quinn tests this is one simple minuet\nFrom one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore he was writing\nHe was doing and he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional cello himself so he was doing this so that he could play along with them and then he would also writes\nStream quintet sport depression king who was a cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to string Quinn tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music\nWhat do we know about what influenced book or any who influenced him\nWhen he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player he and his father were playing in orchestras and he ... he couldn't\nMake a living just by being a cello virtuoso that you had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kind of music and that seemed to influence his writing chamber music rather than say a president at the time\nWell let's get to another uh for ... and this is the cello concerto in gene major performed by the Canadian ... orchestra and on her bills ... on the chosen dusted by Jean\nWhat the ... or something you have to admire this it's it's a lot of playing and then the can sure does there's a lot of ... as well and I think those two things sort of defined book Corrine in many ways he was a virtuoso and wrote\nParts for a cellist in his country or does and he's also known for having been gifted in writing melodies and I couldn't I Wonder if he if he would have ever written more than a couple of operas that he wrote latest\nThere are those okay now to one of his symphonies this is the symphony number three and Jean major played by the London Mozart players [noise]\nOh\nAnd\n\nOne of the things that I hear there is that this was obviously recorded in a big hall or which I loved that you can tell that by listening there but what do you hear that tells you something is a book or in a piece\nYou can hear again this gift for melody and he's writing this in a symphony heightened was writing symphony is at the time it's been suggested that book arena was sued detail oriented that maybe he didn't have\nAn ear for the architecture of a full symphony or if it's funny there is a contemporary book greedy violinist composer June ... piece Carty a in his famous wind\nThat if the almighty wish to speak through music it would be that of heightened if the almighty wish to listen to music we'd be out of ... and ... had that gift for melody and had the gift for the detail and you can hear that just in this a portion of the symphony number three by ... why\nDo you think then that he is not as well known as Mozart Beethoven Chopin Tchaikovsky and others\nIt could be that most of his music his chamber music\nAnd I would say that the appeal of chamber music is not as great as see the appeal\nFor orchestral music and it's not that he didn't write orchestral music and I think it's becoming a little bit better known but I think compared to those other composers or there isn't as much of it and I think that's one of the reasons why it's not as popular in our time\nThat's Victor ... who is host of classic mornings and W.

has her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day today Jim missing wants people to upload photos of the sky and record their reactions to what they see me jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime are nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking up will help us to understand\nMaybe a little bit more about each other and it's still just a tiny bit more connected around this planet so you know some people will look up and this guy and they will fill love they'll fill whole fill fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive and how they express that\nIs what we want to capture\nAnd we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to\nTake these photos and you've got to put them up we're going to display them\nTo the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at that can expand they can go to different folks around the world so I can no in Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of Marjah\nGuy period yeah nice guy right in a nice guy\nWell but but in the sky period and and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus and I've I've taken great pride and telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have\nBut I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were say what people are we're even seeing our impact of on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars route\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere is this planet that warms us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well I Want\nPeople to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we had these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're come face to face that I can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion\nYup and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have no I actually have a\nView of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way we were calling\nThe ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it a sky feet at Wright is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky\nYou know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here no doubt Oregon learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions where we have you because you were inspect your the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years [noise]\nLet's I Want to hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send\nRight right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study\nThat we have is taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet and our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number or a small number but a number of African American women who have gone into space\nBut you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in the space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\n[laughter] because I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up\nBut being that being the the first one was covering the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket scientist to suit technicians you know are being a crew members to involve them in space exploration\nYet even as important is making sure that we understand that individuals on this planet have a right to be involved with space exploration that they understand the impact of this technology and how profound it can be to help us build a better world\nYou want to go back into space again [noise] but you know what we're in space right now [laughter] we're all his weapons and [laughter] and if you look at the sky tapestry what's it lets you rotate this earth\nWhatever amount is right for you you decide eight hundred for for

could be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached some of the Tadic Rodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana\nWhere there were three deaths and Rodney a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we we took a direct hit when it hit us it was ... at a high cat three low cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm hold a lot of places and people will realize that this story does affect people\nThat deep in the end when you've got a storm of this magnitude in movie as fast as it did it held together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you understand your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged in pretty much it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue boredom all evolve and we're hoping to get some some adjusted on it today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a Twenty one years in the military and\nIf it's the damage is it just off the scales bath and buildings Dale almost every tree has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't ... well\nThe county appraiser Carlin the cocktail the Tampa Bay to be in that she's guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county Jackson County were damaged she's using tax Rosen Ariel\nAnd look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plus ... completely destroy she's looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nNow with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd that after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you unequivocal early but they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job\nAnd they have had very aggressive programs to trim back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWhat are some of these is because I I think we heard in one report that the rising is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run between towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood it's just they were so much to breed them they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped and so they were not transmitting\nLook you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to fund a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level a emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does they're all have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know of is so much climate change\nOur inland from the coast a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level is not of course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee this will change the climate among community and editor of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very much Mm\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season so we want to take a closer look with here now resident Jeff ... who is in the studio Hi Hi Robyn you know I have to say I'm One of those people I Love pears I think they are an art form I have ... cookbooks pictures of pairs\nAnd all I Do is use them and salads we blue cheese okay well your whole pair world this is about to get blown out of the parking and says okay all righty okay well the most common\nOne that we see in grocery stores is that on Jew or mans you um there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're gonna find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are some what if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned\nOkay so that's called an Asian pair and I caught one up for you right there they are very crunchy very tart\nSweet also these are best eaten raw Timmy and Asian pair tastes like\nA pair meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juicy ... and\nWonderful and salads wonderful graded also Bartlett another very common for a ride him very sweet red and green as well they are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also ... pairs same deal very earthy flavor and ... parents have any long gated neck\nWhich is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the post\nSaid that because I Am going to
