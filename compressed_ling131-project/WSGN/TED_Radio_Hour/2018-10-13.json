H um dot org it's that Ted radio hour from NPR\nI'm Guy Raj I Want to start the at the beginning of your career in the Nineteen eighties you I guess you you started out as a as a public defender right\n[noise] I did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating\nFrom [noise] and what was what was the idea behind it you thought I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise]\nThat's right and I like lots of people had no idea what was going on in the criminal system in my third year in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense connect and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court and never was able to look away again\nThis is Robyn Steinberg [noise]\nWhat I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes project [noise] um and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we ...\nCourts is deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from Robin ... and I'm ... I'm\nAfraid I'm a hundred times of London messages the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery to laugh at our separation it always has\nWe all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night and America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything these mothers and\nAnd sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nPrice is called mail you how\nMuch does it generally cost to post bail when so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount in their own discretion I have seen it as low as a hundred dollars\nFor the people that we represent and the clients that we see bell is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system [noise]\nSo if you are charged with crime and um you're going to have a court hearing it could be four or five months in the future if you can't post bail you're you're stuck in a jail\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from Amazon Web services

serve non human animals like apes here Steven was on tests\nThe legal thing [noise] it's ... books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing\nThe great age that you'll see behind me they too are\nLegal things now I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car these\nGreat apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman were persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not ... sometimes children were not now no all human beings are considered to be the person's [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons because it's more complicated than that right because like in the U S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and\nThat's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights\nEven live in these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation and Peter Singer\nNow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush grounds\nSpeak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless in defenseless the billions of non human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer\nAnd by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons now at that time\nThere was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ... changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and a Nineteen eighty five I decided to that you would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal ... is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to\nAnd after he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because the Eighteenth century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with\nFor the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd heritage heaviest corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictators required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a rare to have your corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout the Saudi not Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain the ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in it but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your genes summers that of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your gym summertime we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees\nIs because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition\nOf chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention to court to make it\nClear that they are of tongues things that they\nAre conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities\nOn an army filed a hundred and six\nYou know like cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being sleeved is something that grinds against\nEvery idea of justice and you have to step in and stop [noise]\nSo so how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of New York and where were they being held captive\nWell Hercules and Leo were being held captive at Stony Brook university at the age of two professors had taken them from their mothers\nAnd we're keeping them in a cage in the basement of the computer building and they they were being used\nSupport for the Ted

about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers so I I Would\nMake it voluntarily once you've sent out\nTen thousand lettuce do random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you've had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a million is club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and\nTo me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better from my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea\nThat actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who\nThere is\nA yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes Panetta's some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams with us it's just I just got my dog of Adam's saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years of that kind of income\nI Would of course\nProbably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected in fact there's a\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a\nComment in the world to instigate or was it like the chamber in one solution chamber once with fishing buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the\nTypical political out place and go well why do we need that for ... [noise] uh this is a path to is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware\nThat it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament tried to say to your friends oh I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people and we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically\nAnd that we have our strategy a and that is yet to to first get\nThese students assemblies happening more often which seems to be happening or after the average citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading\nOnce one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe it'll spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not going to be easy a political change is never easy uh especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to I Want to innovate on something new I think half system's broken\nAnd unknown to see a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find this little talk at ... dot com\n\nThat hacking the law [noise]\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law because of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is\nThis is ... he's a legal advocate this last year getting ... us who has this book between facts and norms and he says democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world do we want to build together\nWhat are we are one another where do we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts and norms but that is not the world we live in\nOftentimes people who need those ruin the most have never even heard of them [noise] and um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken or both [noise]\nDid they get to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law [noise] to the people\nHere Steve Martin on the stage [noise]\nI Want to tell you about someone I'm going to call them Ravi none the\nReviews from a community of hurts people included out on the western coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company bills to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia is got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company has violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing none to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gates of that factory with a bucket of petrol and his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra Leone in Cambodia in Ethiopia farmers are being ... into putting their stumped prints on fifty years lease agreement sending away all the land they've ever known for a pittance without anybody even explaining the ...\nPeople like Ravi raising their children in the shadow of factories", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "13"}
