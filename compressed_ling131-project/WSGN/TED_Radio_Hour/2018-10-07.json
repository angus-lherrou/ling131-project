F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIt's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping giving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years\nIndividuals' children\nAnd their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this\nVery radio issue of\nDirecting future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use\nIt in embryos to install things like each of the immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher out you were\nBeing a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\nHamster and Derek is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com [noise]\n\nOn today's show we're asking a very important question which is [noise] who are we okay by the way do you have the answer do you know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] but ah [noise] ah every year I have a a an inkling of who we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind in human nature [noise]\nSo what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell if there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equip us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just fed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with us [laughter] okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated\nNature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nThat all of a structure comes from\nIn two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that man\nHas no nature from historian Jose Ortega you gossip man has no instincts and the anthropologist asked we want to do\nThe human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to not from Hochul a scientist Stephen J gold\nNow why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number of political reasons why people have found congenial for most is that if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because zero equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the slate then some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature is that\nIf we were blank slates we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts than perhaps some of them like Dennis To selfishness prejudice and violence\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to go to the human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and talented doesn't all come from the outside oh and anyone who uh\nHas both a child and a house that has certainly noticed that the child exposed to speech full acquire a human language whereas the house well presumably because of some innate difference between them and anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not indistinguishable [noise]\nSo for years the debate about nature versus nurture has been just that that debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this\nShouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nA mistake to think that uh if there is in effect of the environment that shows that were Blake's weights or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are a robots and were programs to uh walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment [noise]\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from

[noise] and how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially is a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing we exist [noise]\nAnd also explains more from the stage [noise]\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness to each of us is all areas without that as well\nAs my self there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or pain and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious she did they say have a sense of self and ask them pieces get faster and smarter maybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my iPhone develops a sense of its ... existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I pretty much\nIn the store I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and about ... within it all kinds of control to these nations that happen with fruit and because of all living voted [noise]\nUm\nI Love this idea of a controlled police nation is is that is that what we experience is that how we experience the world that if\nIt's a control to loose nation we are just essentially hallucinating all the time\nI Love the strike zone I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because it points out that everything that we see consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now\nIs a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us through the windows of our eyes what\nCountries perception is is basically just somebody sitting inside us go looking out there and they see a red table they pass in all game there's an amateur writers hit\nThis real reality [noise]\n\nRight but the truth is that all perceptions are active interpretation that act\nOf informed guesswork that the brain appliance encounters sensory die too I think the ... the way I Can't think of is is that there is no light in the skull and this may sound that was going on in the ...\nAnd out of all over the past in my opinion the Brian ... period and in some sense we we've known this for a long time so since meats and it's been pretty clear that colors red yellow green seven colors and no objective properties of objects in the world\nThey are attributes of of reflected\nLight and and the brain the visual system will make inferences\nBased on wavelengths of light about what color something is a ... something as basic as color is not something that we just passively receive from the world we actively attribute it\nTo things out there on the world and the idea of controlled hallucination is is just that well this applies to everything and this applies to everything that we perceive and not just perceptions of things out there in the world but who set applies to our perceptions about self\nAbout body of our memories of a sense of agency about sensitive volition that every\nThing that we see is a construction but it's it's not a random construction its construction as a best guess that is reined in by the sensory ... times which is why most of us agree when we look at a table that we will say yeah I see a table you see a table and we both see the same thing\nAnd that's because you don't just random constructions that constrained by the sensory data that we get and that's why I think the control of the nation is very appropriate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "07"}
