like a bell pepper growing and just pick it up and start eating it nobody's going to say hey what are you doing that's my bell pepper\nNo of course I don't know that note but the really interesting thing is it's it's ... it helps throw back some attitudes about individuals' behavior because as I say we've got the ... the railway station and all over the place\nAnd we've got big signs that say

born\nThe idea for it came to her on a train ride one afternoon when she was coming back from an environmental conference\nI no intentions of doing anything different on that day I just sat in the audience and listened\nAnd it just suddenly struck me why I just go home and start to do things differently\nI got an a train and I just made up incredible edible [laughter] and it was a really simple model really simple um it was just let's imagine him wherever we live in a ... a neighborhood our town a village whatever works at any scale\nWe planted edible landscapes everywhere that we could you just could like empty lots and just start planting stuff that you leave once you plant food right um and then we've got pictures of that show people what's growing that\nSometimes we asked permission more often we might note\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from Amazon Web services used by millions of customers hey W s provides a range of cloud services and functionality from tools to

connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live\nI just bought a bottle of water and I'm the label it said gluten free\nInteresting well ended it\nI've been out of the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet one thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call Monica cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now I Know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then the corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either some of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial\nActually killed by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of food like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for\nYourself lights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you [noise]\nYeah and I mean like what you're saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that like one day we ship food all over the world right [noise]\nYou know I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this didn't go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you were a guy that a lot of people look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of luck that men and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the B. six begun before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nOf a good diet\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients in plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad but back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both\nHave been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talking at Ted dot com um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I tell you the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs ... about the great use of sardines great\nHow can you not eat pasta why the hell line you can get sweet potato pasta which is which is paleo kind of a housing bust is going to Julia [noise]\nOkay so marked him as saying that that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar I don't have to estimate at Seventy four percent what Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion\nHidden in plain sight absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert Lustig is a pediatrician and a research\nYou know ... ... did you know I mean ... that's even you know some famous now apple puree or evaporated change yeah my favorite because changes so you know juice healthy right what happens when you evaporate change if you get sugar [noise]\nI like steak studies sugar how they manage to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive back\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much and here's rapper less taken on the head stage\nDoes sugar cause diabetes or everyone says well yeah but it's because of the calories sugar empty calories that's the much it is not this is absolutely true sugar are toxic calories so here's the way to look at the ... the prevalence of diabetes worldwide as we speak right\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from life luck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber

Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raz and I'm sure it's a food why we eat what we eat and why\nOur food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates we all think we taste food to nominate Iraq's\nIdea that some illusion in the sense that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the two of the smoky are actually being dictated by nostrils Rob raised it was wonderful job of ...\nThat the information I get from my nose and makes me believe was coming from I ... this is Charles Spence a La Crosse middle research ... ... ... university [noise] what is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... having the psychology department where we look at how the census interacts\nN yes our mouth and nose interact when we eat but sort of our mouse and our years\nWe didn't experiments where we're feeding people a potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound that they could sometimes making their own crunching ... [noise] sometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch the freshness of these other groups that\nCharles says how our food sounds\nWhite wine artificially retro within ... tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine all the ... the tobacco and the dog chocolates in the state and fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea that how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nUm here this morning to tell you about the perfect meal world convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavor was narrowed them as of the wind in the glass\nReflects what what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how to measure is\nI'm a tendency among the scientists that then you're a guest on this\nIs this thing people like your eye a brain scanner\nGive them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain ... this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy running is one of the problem here which is that in fact in the matter is that one of these brain scanners can log on your back with your head climbing stale with a Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically square sin ah some drink you call what have you thought you had all kinds of jolt an old spoil that the brains of gun alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\n[laughter] I'm actually a different for each and every one of us may come into something very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere these up and we'll stick in people's minds as as the best meals but it would I guess has to be there is um\nThe mood you're in on the people you're with so because the social aspects of dining\nA no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with that pot and I say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with doesn't resonate in then you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it some things that are truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met a friend who's just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red line that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we will\nNorthern Europeans um but to kill you go for that so holidays to the Mediterranean [noise]\nI'm not saying some well or on the side of the sea suffering that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless either passed by said while you've ever had so great that you want to buy Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have an ... or you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah and you say well how is it something about when they when they are playing with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not just a tool and we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in certain environments in certain states would mind\nOn a mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some myths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise] and put some of that pleasure into what we think about food [noise]\nIn fact is Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but our brain has brought me everything else the sound of the ... the smell of the salt and see how the walls of the songs on our backs all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that insight or in the dishes like so so that he that too much to install restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition and star restaurant\nOr what type of crops\nThere's no ... on the table was no glasses or places like nothing was just a plastic car people wait and see what he tells me here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can see what tables full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up furiously that plastic how\nI Wonder if they get up you know there is a little ... euro tower and it makes it moving sounded and sort of some of those type of it that will be laughing and then even guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's and that\nIs the moment when it first comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table enhanced the mood and he knows that will improve even the taste of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so it's like from from a neurological ...\nSo we don't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste\nI work with ... Koch is if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending out question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of construction something they remember the experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say and this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color rich school days just the sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but some say okay so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food in their plastic cutlery known as a silver and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at it and they ...\nSo they say all these things on the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... food just by itself it's always of on something in a certain environment\nThere's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now popping up starting their own Venus who who are really thing for the first time in history saying\nWe don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were swimming [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book it's called the perfect meal you can see his entire\nTalk at Ted that NPR outdoors [noise]\nSo let's get shifted a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's\nWhat most helped you get that [noise] my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a wagon in again where it's like an Indian\nReferencing I'm [noise] I'm very grateful for use it for a yes or Brad can do that you were out everything is in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week Marcel and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's something that we were friends is over or rice dish or I'm In the vegetables were\nWhat are you by like\nMeal worms and buffalo worms", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "20"}
