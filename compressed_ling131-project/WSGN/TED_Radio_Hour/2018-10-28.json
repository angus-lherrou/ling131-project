there was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and I'm used to live on the phone call so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know mass a room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially\nI Do naturally because I've men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny ... way people are able to move on with me\n[noise] yeah because I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because I mean\nDisability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been ... because\nBully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's monitor what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters we're mopping I was not been if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went to the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper\n[noise]\nMy father taught me how I Walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in front\nOf me [laughter] have have said [noise] my inner stripper was very strong and\n[noise]\nYou know by the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been on one too many times [noise]\n\nToo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right\nI was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\nDid you realize that you were funny\n[laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach\nAnd she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior you know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people\nMargaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV and so I signed up for a comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his Darren\n[laughter] you know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons regular order challenges their humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say\nI'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalk about guys are talking about probably talked about you know and I'm like I really just want to talk about beyond say the cat [laughter] so it gets exhausting\nHaving to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now that I Do battle because having grown up with you know one foot in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did the dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability\nThat was going to be the thing that I was championing know\nGrowing up there were only six Arabs in my town and they were all my family now there are twenty hours in town and they are still my family [noise] I don't think I wouldn't even know that we weren't Italian

customers learned more in constant contact dot com\nAnd from the John ... catcher in the MacArthur Foundation\nAnd on the show too painfully funny\nIdeas about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian again for sun and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what\nThey call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required to little patience\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful\nAnd I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes but when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a\nIs a joint on shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip and again took with the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the\nMuslims are coming and not too long after he came up something happened back in New York at least one again usually felt welcomed and accepted\nHate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better font but\nAh why not lost her own poster campaign right that's a nice things about Muslims so myself fellow comedians will be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised money weren't an ca for over five months approved and then she we\nWere supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to ban the poster citing political content once they got a couple of those posters here one\nI'm a Muslim Muslims [noise] let's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for a recipe\nFor us are considered political by the NCAA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided to change our fighting bigotry with delight\nSo basically what I'm saying a couple of dirt back comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one\n[noise]\nWas a very weird feeling I was like as a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family\nAnd those death threats are definitely not funny\nBut just changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapon [noise]\n\nShe took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and a and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called name that religion we are going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was also the New Testament or the Koran\nIf your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating already and we lose our salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which totally book stipulates that a girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death\nOf all of her own it is the\nPeople guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was violence um came from the curve on Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no men has touched me\nAnd it'll be just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stuff done them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God\nYou know a lot of difference between the three of them do you know [noise] it's incredible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue state\nTo hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing was performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you get one\nPerson to laugh and the ... will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people chuckling and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular a shift in perception [noise]\nIs social change\nBut it takes time and it takes like millions of bees chuckle [noise]\nMedia and again first she's the author of how to make white people laugh\nAnd she also hosts a podcast called the nation you can find her full talk at ... dot com [noise]\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can telescope with things that on their face are very funny\nThis is this is Lisa\nThis is Kevin real as gifts to the writer and they said the comedian\nLosers these that are taking\nThe exact reasons for this [noise] she's ... she's ready for it though [noise]\nOr how it was a vet was murdered [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is what Kevin does for a living\nBut being funny is also a way he deals with light humor I think is either kind\nOf like an invitation or a shield [noise] but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on\nAnd so my defense mechanism was humor [noise] but I also think that\nHumor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning\nSpent at the time and in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark hopeless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly mental wise I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of you know shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin braille tells a story on the head stage and you can already tell this story is gonna sound pretty different from the other ones you've heard on the show\n[noise] for a long time my life [noise] I felt like I've been living two different lives", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year":
