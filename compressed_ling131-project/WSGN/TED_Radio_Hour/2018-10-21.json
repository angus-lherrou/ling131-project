its power to change so much about the way we live [noise]\nI just bought a bottle of water and on the label it said gluten free interesting well and it is [laughter] for says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marksmen describing how over the past fifty years\nCorn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nThing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now\nNo fuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many Sawyer corn products is could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought any store not that they are any good but they were there\nMost bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew where we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of food like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese very stuff that will kill you [noise]\nYeah and like what you were saying earlier are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like today we ship food all over the world right [noise]\nYeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes if you want to mango you're gonna be able to get a mango\nIn ... so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you were a guy that a lot of people are gonna look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of luck that men and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the B. six begun before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because at our broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah within those rules you eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients implants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bet but back to animals on junk food we don't need either of them for health both\nHave been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not orange craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food we can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin\nAnd we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that path factor [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at Ted dot com um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next [laughter] who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago it was a pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs reading about the great use of sardines great\nHow can you not eat pasta ... you can get sweet potato pasta which is which in paleo come from a housing process going to Julia [noise]\nOkay so marked him as saying that that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar I don't have to estimate it's Seventy four percent ... act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion\nHidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\n[noise] this is Dr Robert Lustig he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... ... did you know I mean dimmer are that's even had some famous now\nApple puree or evaporated ... yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy right what happens when you evaporate changes you get\n... studies sugar how it's managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they process food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive back\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much I'm into tears Robert Lustig on the head stage does\nSugar cause diabetes or everyone says well yeah but it's because of the calories sugar empty calories that's the much it is not this is absolutely true sugar are toxic calories so here's the way to look at this the protests\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from life luck life luck with Norton works to help protect

their research efforts to him\nThat's at eight food why we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the to the smoky are actually being dictated by our nostrils but our brains doing is wonderful job of ... and the information I get from my nose and making me believe as if it's coming from\nI ... [noise] this is Charles Spence or across middle research ... ... ... university [noise] what is the cost of medical research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... having the psychology department where we look at how the census interacts\nN gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat but sort of our mouth and our years\nWe didn't experiments where we're feeding people up potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound they could sometimes making their own crunching ... sometimes crotch I sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the crunches the freshness of these other attributes that\nCharles says how our food\nSounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might Carla I white wine ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine all the ... the ... in the dark chocolates in stone fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea that\nHow we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles that's on the head stage\nHere this morning to I'll tell you about the perfect meal rural convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind in the glass\nBut if I look at what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how the measure is\nI'm a tendency among the scientists that then you're a guest on this\nIs this thing people like your eye in a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink and see which parts of the bright lights up this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy is one of the problem here which is that in fact if their measures that one of the brain scanners got lying and you're back with your head climbing stale\nPut your head all kind of a jolt and that ... oil that the brains down alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal is one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\n[laughter] I was actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be of some very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese almost is taking people's minds as as best meals but ... what I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nA I have no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with apartments I\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed to play with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of its um from the province all rose a paradox I'd say use to describe a northern Europeans um but to ... go for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nNess sitting somewhere on a on the side of the sea suffering that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless like the best buy said while you've ever had so great that you wanted to buy Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have an ... or you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap birthday yeah as you say well how is it something about when they when they are playing with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments in certain states of mind\nAnd all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way to miss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise] and put some of that pleasure into what we think about food [noise]\nFact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food\nAnd you know methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but all brain has brought me everything else the sound of a single the smell of assaulting see on the walls of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that inside a in the dishes they are so then he that too much than style restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant\nA white table cloths\nWas not ... on the table was no glasses are nice places and then nothing it's just a plastic car people wait say what he calls me or seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can see what will tables full nothing will happen until somebody picks up seriously that plastic how\nI Want to pick it up you know there\nIs a little one euro tower and it makes a moving sound and sort of some of those type of it that will be laughing and then even guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's and that\nIs the moment when the first is comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the taste of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] wow so aside from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste\nI work with a young chef which is if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question has several weeks have to be living his restaurant\nLet's say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of construction something there might be experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days just the sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food we plastic cutlery nah nah it's silver and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking actually nature so they they're saying all these things in the one hand but clearly\nAnd those kinda contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly the ... I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting their own venues who who I really think the first time in history saying\nWe don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book it's called the perfect meal you can see his entire\nTalk at Ted that NPR Doherty [noise]\nSo let's get shifted a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's\nWhat ... does okay my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a while getting in getting where it's like an Indian\nReferencing andme I'm very good for you confront a yes or right can you that you were out everything is in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week my cell and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's uh something to that we were friends is over or a rice dish or I'm In the vegetables or in the ... what do you buy like which ones are we have four species that are for say when the ... that is a locusts crickets meal worms and buffalo worms", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "21"}
