F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIt's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different category\nBut for right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping feeling that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use\nIt ... embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ or being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\nHamster and Barry is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control evolution you can check out his head talk at ... dot com\n[noise]\nOn today's show we're asking a very important question which is [noise] who are we [noise] okay do you have the answer deem know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I I have a a a an inkling of where we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University\nBut is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nThat equipped PSAs with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started\nHuman beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that\nWhen we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and I meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian who they are taking you gossip man has no instincts and the anthropologist fast we want to do\nThe human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J gold\n... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are a number of political reasons why people have found congenial foremost is that if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the slate than some people could have more of an others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of a human nature is that\nIf we were blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts than perhaps some of them I condemn us to selfishness prejudice and violence\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to go to the human mind is a blank slate\nThey had more than one child knows that can come into the world with certain temperament and how it doesn't all come from the outside [noise] oh and anyone who uh\nHas both a child and a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed to speed for acquiring human language whereas the house well presumably because of some innate difference between them and anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not in this\nThing will shovel [noise] so for years the debate about nature versus nurture has been just that\nDebate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nIt's a mistake to think that uh if there is an effect of the environment that shows that were blanks weights or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are our robots and we're programmed to uh walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment [noise]\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from the University of Florida we're solving for next is powered by its land grant heritage from

I think to put it in my simply for conscious system there is something\nIt is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious [noise] better than [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if\nWe can recreate it artificially is a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing we exist [noise]\nAnd also explains more from the stage [noise]\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all areas\nWithout that as well as myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or pen and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious she did they say have a sense of self and ask them teachers get faster and smarter maybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my I find developed a sense of its ... existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I pretty much\nIn the store I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and about sounds within it all kinds of controls at least a nation that happen with through and the cost of living voted [noise]\n\nIs that how we experience the world that if\nIt's a control to loose nation we are just essentially\nHallucinating all the time\nI Love this rise I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because it points out that everything that we perceive consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now\nIs a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us through the windows of our eyes scanned what\nConscious perception is is basically just somebody sitting inside us go looking out there and I see a red table they see a passing\nA law again there's an amateur writers hit [noise]\nReal reality [noise]\n\nThat's right but the truth is that\nBoth perceptions are acts of interpretation that act of informed guesswork that the brain appliance encounters sensory die too I think the way I Can't think of this is that there is no light in the skull and this may sound that was going on in the brain\nOr electrical impulses whizzing around and complex path and an out of all that much in the in the Brian ... at ... and in some sense we\nWe've known this for a long time since meats and it's been pretty clear that colors red yellow green color is no object to properties of objects in the world they are attributes of of reflected\nLight and and the brain the visual system will make inferences\nBased on white lies about what color or something it or ... something as basic as color is not something that we just passively receive from the world we activity attribute it to things out there on the world\nThe idea of control to the nation is is just that well this applies to everything and this applies to everything that we perceive and not just because sections of things out there in the world but also it applies to our perceptions about self about buddy about memories of a sense of agency about sensitive volition that every\nThing that we see is a construction but it's it's not a random construction its construction as a best guess that is reined in by the sensory ... times which is why most of us agree when we look at uh\nBecause you don't just random constructions that constrained by the sensory data that we get and that's why I think the um controlled who this nation is very appropriate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "06"}
