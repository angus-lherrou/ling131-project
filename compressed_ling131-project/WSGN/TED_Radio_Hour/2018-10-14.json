right\n[noise] I did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating\nFrom and what was what was the idea behind it you thought I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise]\nThat's right and I like lots of people had no idea what was on another little system in my third year in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense connected and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court and never was able to look away again\nThis is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this past this project [noise] um and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how\nWe defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts is deeply deeply defined by class and by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you are pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just brushing my individual clients but their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from Robin ... on the stage\nRate um nonsense of fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nAddicted to imprison us from slavery or math incarceration it always has\nWe all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night in America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything these mothers and\nAnd sons and daughters are there\nAnd that\nPrice is called down\nMuch does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own discretion I have seen it as low as a hundred dollars\nFor the people that we representing the clients that we see bell is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system [noise]\nSo if you are charged with crime and um you're going to have a court hearing it could be four or five months in the future if you can't post bail you're you're stuck in a jail\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from Amazon Web services used by millions of

legal thing [noise]\nThe great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells in his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes\nThey're legal things [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the time of slavery the person isn't anybody who has the capacity for one or more legal rights\nAt one time it was a defined as a very\nNarrow way I mean like you mean like ... ... men\nSometimes children were not now no all human beings are considered to\nBe the person's [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons because it's more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals that's a ... he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since she read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defense list and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals as ... I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons now at that time\nThere was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially not change the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream that was my ... and I'm In Nineteen eighty five\nFor I'd be ready to file for law suits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much had to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal ... is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London\nAnd after he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because to an Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility to Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the anti marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the quarter kings bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and get a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nAt that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man who walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walk that but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your Jane summers that's of course a non human version of James ...\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find a gym summers then we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of\nAll the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of\nChimpanzees that we can gather in\nOne place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous things that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty pages of affidavits and we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge to allow an autonomous\nBeing to being sleeved is something that grinds against\nEvery idea of justice and you have to step in and stop [noise]\nSo so how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of New York and where were they being held captive\nWell Hercules and Leo were being held captive at Stony Brook university at the age of two professors had taken them from their mothers and we're keeping them in a cage in the basement of the computer building and they they were being used in ...\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learned more life lock dot

foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nToday ideas about hacking the law and we're hearing from Brett headache advocating for getting rid of a elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers so I I Would make a voluntary once you've sent out\nTen thousand lettuce to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interested in that you would do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you had gender balanced you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me that the laws that come out of such that institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea\nThat actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nIs a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John out of some people I'm not tonight I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams actually settles yeah this is science cut by ... Adams saying\nAre the people who want political power I specifically that people who should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years of that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to instigate\nThat the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber [noise] uh this is a path to is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware\nThat it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament tried to say to your friends oh I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically if it is something that can\nReally spread on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have out strategy a and that is yet to to get these ... assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost\nA million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe it'll spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess and you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not I think it will be easy to political change is never easy uh especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city states\nRead headache\nHe runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy\nYou can find as full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas about hacking the law [noise]\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law because of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is\nBe back tomorrow he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher ... us who has this book between facts and norms and he says democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat do we are one another where do we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between faction norms but that is now the world we live in a lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut really huge get oftentimes of people who need those rules the most have never even heard of them [noise] and um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken or both [noise]\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the
