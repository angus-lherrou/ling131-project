one [noise] if if there was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and I'm used to live on the phone call so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to ...\nWhich is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially when\nI Do naturally because I've been stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on with me\n[noise] yeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean disability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's monitor what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters we're mopping I was not been if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went through the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper\n[noise]\nMy father taught me how I Walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me [laughter] have have said [noise] my inner river was very strong and\n[noise]\nYou know by the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been on one too many times [noise]\n\nToo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like\nThe walking in order to be mainstream didn't a public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\nWhen did you realize that you were funny\n[laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach\nAnd she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know had different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm hysterical [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons regular or their challenges through humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy of the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and justify telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes\nAbout guys are talking about all the you know I'm like I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now\nThat I Do battle because having grown up\nWith you know one foot in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did that Ted Talk I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of everyone I really thought it was the disability\nThat was gonna be the thing that I was championing [noise]\nGrowing up there were only six Arabs in my town and they were all my family now there are twenty hours in town and they are still my family [noise] I don't think anyone even notice three weren't Italian [laughter]\n[noise]\nSupport for the Ted

helps us deal with the chaos of life [noise]\nSo we're just hearing from comedian and again for our side and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what\nThey call social justice comedy [noise] and they were trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required to little patience\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint and shared experience\nLike a group mind that's engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called\nAre coming in too long after he came out something happen\nYou hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system now the truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better font but\nAh why not lost her own poster campaign right the nice things about my lungs so myself fellow comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign we raised money work with the NCAA for over five months got approved and today\nWe're supposed to go up a the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content let's take a look at a couple of those posters here one\nI'm a Muslim can do push-ups Muslims [noise] let's say or what the truth about Muslims they have great for recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign abiding bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying is a couple of dirt comedians took on a major in New York City agency and the comedians one\n\nWith a very weird feeling I was like a lot of blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family\nAnd those death threats are definitely not funny\nBut just changing all danger I still think that social justice companies one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nShe took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of the film I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful yeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we'd like set up a table called me about religion\nWe're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was old tests the New Testament or the Koran does your guest\nRight you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating\nStuff like that which holy book stipulates that a girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of her on\nHer own it is the\n[noise] people guessed wrong\nOn because they just assumed everything that was violence um came from the Koran Mary said\nMy lord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nLet me just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stopping them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God\nYou know a lot of drivers with three of them does you know [noise] it's incredible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people chuckling and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception [noise]\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chuckle [noise]\nMedia and again first she's the author of how to make white people laugh\nAnd she also ... called the nation you can find her full talk to dot com [noise]\nThe show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can telescope with things that on their face\nAs the guest said the writer and they stand up comedian ... that are taken [noise]\nHe's in a sense but [noise]\nShe's ... she's ready for it though [noise]\n[noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny is also\nA way he deals with light humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or a shield\nBut you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor [noise]\n\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas and thoughts and stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy\nBecause there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning\nIt was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered in just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuated in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark hopeless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly in a way I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight up you know shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin briel tells a story on the stage and [noise] he can already tell\nFor a long time my life [noise] I felt like I've been living two different lives", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "27"}
