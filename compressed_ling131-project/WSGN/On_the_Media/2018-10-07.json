kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news items curious content actually diminishes for people as more accusations and marriage we saw freight instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were pressed memory cases in my life especially against one yeah so the question is if there is something going on was or hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah way more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that could be a bandwagon\nOh effect or technique which is a way that a lot of people who are accused respond ... stands for deny attack and reverse victim an offender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to carrying every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation and loading powerfully that tends to us just scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of the nation we saw his righteous indignation your show by his tears

catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meaning the white\nPeople and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted Alex Band sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really

Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer he said having wrong\nOne more wrong and why please on ... and I came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the ... car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me\nIs the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you will understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation the leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota was nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people\nWithstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live\nFully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there yeah\nAlcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared at Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian and having us this land nearby all for the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doomed from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nJust as we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock\nMy own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means\nWho was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a uh\nAnd because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys aback man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join that care of in\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time this current that we have to commit violence in order to be heard\nAnd I don't want to see and hear the kinds of violence might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile\nMurders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it\nTo aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government at Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German uh Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nMilitary build up everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom were not native hostage\nAnd then later the hostage just said we refer you to go to any time we just didn't want to go and we figured if we did go to the government would kill all the Indians there actually brings us that [laughter] and Wilson was the head of the reservation he was the travel chairman\nPlenty of of exclusions and traumas but also a surplus\nIn my mind it's a story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want it to David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really seeking out to be on the show

[laughter]\nAnd you say that India and the thing is the ads and and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars\nAll these German ... states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies of Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation myth\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources describe these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as decadent and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temps\nWe're around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland which throughout the nineteenth century became a root off of blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the late Nineteen century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old cheddar hand and his Apache friend written into\nThe farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter] way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shatter hand on himself so named because he could not this fall is out with one explosive punch exactly Apache teeth and then to seem to be little really popular factor among the German public right\nYes he is an an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter] she's always out there by himself looking for white people he can help\nAnd Carl my made him exotic enough to fit into the frame of the adventure but as some scholars describe it he also seems to be a very good German [laughter]\nBecause he has his character trait that their German ... was the worst supposed to strive towards like honesty bravery industry is in is\nThese novels had a very long life was Hitler\nIt is sad that late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand we knew two novels to the troops\nBecause he said reading about vintage who will help German officers you with your ... warfare on the Eastern Front that vintage who was the id\nWho said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also pragmatist said it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German Indian Suzie as them why not ... it and profit from it\nPeople like you know how they take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym ... set presenting Indian novels to German children teaches them about leadership\nMilitary training and racial ideology how to teach about race ideology\n... take wrote about ... and he like in ... to come so not only to the famous Germanic leader army news who defeated the Roman legions at the battle of ... book forest in nine a D\nD also like him to come to Adolf Hitler saying all three United people who were ... among themselves and make the people's strong in the face of danger\nHe also said to come to last because the different Native American tribes that he United did not feel themselves as a race as a people so he could not form a nation\nAnd that's what Hitler did when he United the four reeling German and I'm doing air quotes your rights\nBut the other racial thing is that national socialism defines itself as the most radical application of natural law the leading Nazi newspaper for instance\nScientists examples of infanticide and old people and killing themselves among ... communities", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "07"}
