Garfield\nFor the past two weeks little was known about the enormous human caravan wending its way toward the U.S Mexico border\nExcept that it was a political bonanza for the Republican Party and remember it's going to be an election of the power of that and you know what I'm Talking about Donald Trump characterized the exodus as a\nWord of would be illegal immigrants about the surge over unprotected borders to take our jobs flood or community of gang activity and drugs and as a bonus harbor Middle Eastern terrorists\nAnd is now obviously tried to conflate both Middle Eastern fair and illegal immigration and sort of a double racist sandwich\nWhen he goes off the face of all Americans in the hands of Mexico Geraldo no never have\nThat as opposed to the truth thousands of desperate people many of them women and children in fear of their lives taking advantage of safety in numbers and no need to pay\nIt's to apply for legal political asylum\nSarah ... a freelance reporter traveling with the current event has written for the Daily Beast about the cruel reality behind the surge of migrants not an invasion or worry stunk to beat Donald Trump\nBut the desperate reaction to ongoing crisis in Honduras Sarah welcome to in the media thank you for having\nNot until the last couple of days we're speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nDrug in a population of truckers with so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with the gun named Bartolone Fuentes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell see I think that are totally started in the second stage as this\nAccording to have our tolo and I have not been able to confirm that there were other people who have had a much smaller care that he saw information about it on Facebook and decided to get in touch with those organizers\nHe has always had an experience and facilitate ... immigration um and so he got in touch with them verified it and then he shared the post on Facebook\nAccording to tell us what happened was there isn't any two hundred three hundred people and then there's this news report on hunters is most watch cable news network called each seat\nSuing coming I'm dog gonna see went on Saturday identified him as a leader that my body on a Wednesday and then when I look\nIn and they are to nearly said that he would be paying for food and other causes are people\nThat are not going to me that you know the gospel and I want but I don't know how to learn and he said\nHe got tons and tons and tons of cause\nBut you know I don't think that's sort of the explanation I think it helped start things and get them going but then all of the other factors for why people migrate contribute to why it has to help out in the way that it has and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people\nBut he definitely credits that positive news report with the initial explosion\nA report from HGH here is what ... told you and I'm I'm reading from your story\nIn Honduras the government wants to minimize what people are leaving they know they're going to leave and they want to say that they're doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that they that is the government creates\nAnd this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people really just need to get out there is this right wing media me it's actually video of turban members\nBeing paid cash money\nAs the story is told that it's you know George Soros money\nOr Democratic Party money bribing people had northward to invade or for\nThe right one caravans they liked the garbage a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan but that has been debunked tests are not\nYeah absolutely there's been multiple fact checked on it first day on a busy owned by the New York times like there's absolutely nothing to back up that George tourist is\nPaying anyone on the care that I Believe that it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed at that and that's really not unusual considering the local support that we're seeing for migrants here in Mexico and the town once people get there\nAnd then along the way that she will pass out water than at a close ally no one told me yesterday and how are the migrant settled people came out and we're giving out toys underwear all these sorts of different necessities they're really seeing a groundswell of local support for this caravan\nKnow what's interesting about that Trump is that its origins seemed to be the hunter and the ... to the United states\nWho sent the video footage to a Republican congressmen who immediately tweeted it out and there are ... caught fire so this is not only mid term politics playing out\nIts Honduran domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plant that false explanation\nThat explanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period by the ... affair the closest thing to the bathroom\nTo the United states has around Hungarians is that it's funded by the opposition of hunter and that it is\nSort of a political game that people within the country are playing that sort of more than a line that I've been seeing raised in ... which makes sense the country the extremely polarized and then they just had to\nCounting the votes shut down and when they came back on\nThe leader of the opponents slowly starting to slip away and the current President Juan Orlando Hernandez who had been the income that one power and so critics allege that he stole the election and it said at three in the country and try and rats thirty people died in that shuffle mostly killed by security forces\nTo the country has had grown in polarization sense so you know they're starting to see that narrative as a president that frankly facing quite legitimate I\nKnow I Know you have to go let me ask you one last question is there one story that you've encountered the kind of crystallized says the situation the the personal drama or the politics and the fear\nI mean you turn around and every person who has the story and it really it just makes their claims credible I met somebody the other day who said that his son was killed by then the second was fourteen he made a clean\nThe police and now he's playing for his life he's afraid to come for and you know with his name or any of the details and the press because his family

point three that will you be H in [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to on the media on public radio for the heart of Alabama Ninety point three WBAI Jim Birmingham or one oh four point by about them and board game\nComing up in the next hour\nIt's all things considered weekend\nWith Michel Martin\nIs on the media I'm Bob Garfield when election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trends individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including\nQuestions remain can\nMean any man he's been wanting to enter a woman cannot do\nAnytime I Want to bring that down and privacy and the man [noise] you know ...\nIt's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me out but see the activists on the other side it's a question many themselves trans went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nWere able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from\nFriendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients do a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling\nWhat we find when we do a series of follow up surveys three days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had that conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not\nThat treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nNineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing one\nThing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those a trans phobic advertisements to say well if we showed them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effect we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely I haven't asked what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy on the matter of campaign theory\nWe're actually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moved from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to a number of volunteers who have to fan out in the community\nWhich is why the campaign industrial complex is built around television advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies hold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom\nOf political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign in twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so from my perspective if campaigns don't try and really think about\nIs that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success and in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team but you need is a candidate or a cause\nThat many kinds of engaged individuals want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three\nWill that tell us anything definitive about inoculation is there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results that's kind of a trap that the research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant has been for a hundred years we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't know because the campaign only happened a particular way so that is why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries is that as new ideas and innovations\nCome out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think the campaigns will or even necessarily should be taking this one study we have and never reorientate all their activities around it within the next year I Hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence base that\nIs very persuasive and rigorous and prejudice reduction advocates uh will be interested in applying in their work\nDavid thank you so much sure thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist at the graduate business school of Stanford University Matt ... has been
