staff writer lily Luther last November she explained for love\nHold on her again to identify the new fallacies she's seen lately like the empty bandwagon fallacy\n[laughter] the anti bandwagon fallacy it's something I kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news items trees content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerge we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were memory faces in my life especially against so the question is if there is something ... going on was or hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah when more

which is a way that a lot of people who are accused respond\n... stands for deny attack and reverse victim an offender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to carrying every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation and loading powerfully that tends to us to scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of the nation we saw his righteous indignation your show by his tears are induced fury not a doctor for but rather on this on for confirmation process which frankly ...\nAnd I saw in the aftermath of the hearing a surprising number of pundits describing both his testimony in her as as equally credible which I found astonishing but once again we tend to find anger [laughter] especially when it comes from a man to be somehow corroborating it's one of the things that we are\nTaught another thing that was on display this week\nIf we do all these things well then we will be reunited with our loved ones and our ancestors in the after world give us almost Protestant and its its insistence on a kind of work ethic as it spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently [noise]\nSome people thought if they did the dances and the right way and for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meaning the white\nPeople and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nIt was some other allied bands and surrounded them the next day they moved to disarm them it's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with hodgkiss cannons on largely an armed men women and children\nThe descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we spare even a ... of an Indian\nAnd then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer he said having wrong to them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization follow\nIt up with one more wrong and wipe these on pain and and came up all creatures from the face of the earth\nBy virtue of of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the ... car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yet deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other one\nWhy you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you\nMinnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just\nDifferent facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point\nWhen did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults in our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist well then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nAlcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair and I don't want our dealings with a Caucasian and having this this land nearby off of the following treating real purchase ... for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doomed from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nJust as we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with the FBI is rife they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first piece\nWhen a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock\nMy own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means\nWho was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timbre in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ...\nOne of Nixon's guys back man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have to violence in order to be hurt [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed the times come violence [noise] might have to be committed [noise]\nBeen a number of very high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge\nAnd in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with\nThe awful and so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded me was under siege\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it I did\nAim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people the troubled government of Pine Ridge was very against this stick Wilson the German the Pine Ridge was interested in mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military build up everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom we are not native hostage\nAnd then later the hostage just said we refer you to go to any time we just didn't want to go and we figured if we did go to the government would kill all the Indians there actually brings us that [laughter]\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability an intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise] [noise]\nIn my mind it's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the

heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects they're checking in communities nationwide\nFuture at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever pond caster found\nBrett Kavanaugh's quest for a seat on the Supreme Court has become much more than a job interview and much more than a dispute about what happened one night\nIt's racing hard questions about sex politics privilege and even about how our democracy works so we're going to ask some prominent thinkers about what this all says about the state of the country and if they see a way forward\nThat's next time on all things considered from NPR News this afternoon from Ford aside on Ninety point three WB a gym\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to on the media on public radio for the heart of Alabama ... WBAI Jim Birmingham for one oh four point five FM in Fort Paine\nThis is on the media and Brooke Gladstone indigenous people stay on Monday we'll pay homage too long ago he says ancestors and homelands were trampled with colonial disregard\nThe question of who should claims solidarity with this minorities seems straightforward enough but perhaps not because of Germany's racist far right party alternative for Germany claims kinship with the plight of Native Americans\nGerman historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across Indian imagery in an alternative for Germany mean whacking to pass and fortunately\nI found it hilarious at first\nIt was in a tweet by one of the local branches of ... the alternative for Germany their tweet showed the photograph of sitting bull it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party mhm Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you'll find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon\nIndian Suzy ...\nAnd you say that India and the thing is the ads and and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nGo hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the German knees were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies off Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation miss\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so\nAnd their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources describe these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as decode than and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament what's akin to that of the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off of blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the late Nineteen century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and his Apache friend written into\nThe farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter] way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shatter hand on himself so named because he could not this fall is out with one explosive punch exactly Apache Chief then to seem to be little really popular factor among the German public right\nShe is an ... an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter] she's always out

supposed to strive towards like honesty bravery industry is in is\nThese novels had a very long life was Hitler\nYet it is sad that late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler
