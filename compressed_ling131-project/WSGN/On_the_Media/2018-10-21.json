plans to use nations oil income to finance social and economic measures\nThat could have been written last year I'm thinking of Thomas Friedman ... piece in November titled Saudi Arabia is Arab Spring at last the crown prince has big plans for his society yeah\nThat's really the hit with this narrative is the fact that it's constantly on the brink of being that kind of enlightened reformed progressive society you know regardless of which came which monarch happens to be in power at the time they're always just aspiring towards something but just never quite seemed to get there\n\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone over the past decade Elizabeth Warren has become a progressive ...\nPerhaps the most powerful voice among the progress is right now I live with my friends and I love her to be anything I'm I'm going to be a female those buses or\nLet the senator has struggled with the personal issues since she first ran for office in two thousand twelve\nThis war and I want to start with questions about your Native American heritage acknowledged that you listed yourself as a minority in a faculty or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to list yourself or in those director resists of Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if not\nI have to answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are from my brothers are like family\nJust picking up a box personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced she said\nBecause their votes where I was an Indian that she was Native American in July he escalated I won't give me a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by\nIf you take the test or does your does your there\nThis week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minute pre campaign video and then she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nThe ... genome we did find five segments of Native American and\nFor the response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored it first showed in the media and it's sort of the men and Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that her you sort of DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and the last appropriate accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bond sides\nA political miscalculation but also a stumble into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim tall ... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us as a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest at the same\nBy blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you are looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors ... at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has a household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indian swelled tribesmen first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their can these are fluid kinship groups rate\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base role you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and around the whole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who's your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nIn my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient they will looks\nNo I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to one ...\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... he'll dissent rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonize we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise]\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something ... she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about\nIn order to defend herself against his times you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma in the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nBut but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important\nIs so prominent in racial discourse in the United states\nI have one drop back there somewhere therefore I can make a claim that is very racialized thinking\nAnd again native people in the U. S. are not completely exempt from that we struggle with that because it's imposed on us but we also have this much more powerful way of identifying that's about can ship and driving citizenship and that helps us mitigate some of the\nWorld Alondra thank you very much it's a pleasure to speak with uber Alondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council profess\nIn a race reparations and reconciliation after that you know [noise]\n\nApplication of genetic research and another kind of controversy twin disease on me [noise] on\nThe media is supported by target preventing future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever pond caster found\n\nWhat percent of the food in American supermarkets do actually think is\nFood the definition of food is something that sustains and nurses and nourishment is something that increases your health so forty percent of the stuff and Americans markets wouldn't qualify as food what forty\nPercent wouldn't qualify sued right\nHow we connect with our food that's next time Ted radio hour from NPR\nThis evening from six to seven on WB H um\n\nYou're listening to on the media on your NPR station Ninety point three W.

role in ancient mythology ease the founders of Rome remiss and Rami list twin brothers raised by a giant wolf\nCaster ... pilots have twin brothers who's Gemini forms sparkle in the night sky the birth of twins has been interpreted as good luck and is bad and they themselves as two halves of the lightness and darkness of our nature\nThat's never stopped you see it in size five saw gets like Star Trek\nDoes he need ... votes for the green\nThe Southern California woman who was dubbed the evil twin and convicted of plotting to kill her twin sister could be granted parole as vehicles for

partners in crime are you doing\nBut beyond mere novelty multiple births can provide scientists deep insights into the age old argument between nature and nurture\nA documentary released this summer three identical strangers tells the story of triplets David Eddie and Bobby adopted by three different families and studied under highly unusual circumstances spoilers I had\nThe ship or a to these boys super [noise]\nThe parents had never been told that there were two other children what was the ... how could you not out there trying to conceal what they did from the people who did it when you play with him to do something very wrong with you know to come up with something was\nThe secret study orchestrated by psychologist Peter New power to examine how three distinct parenting styles might shape identical triplets reared apart\nNot until the boys met by chance in age Nineteen did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data that remains largely locked away in an archive at Yale\nAccording to Dr Nancy Siegel the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unruly study would likely inconclusive and definitely cruel well I I think\nThis was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of there\nBecause being a twin is very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like NASA's twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who spent a year in space while the swing lived on earth the me had a few things with this Scott\nKelly and Mark Kelly are the only identical twin astronauts in history but following DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore\nBut you are in faith has already made got two inches taller than his brother ... seven percent of Scott's James or not return to normal after he returns on two years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins that space travel altered genetic expression it did not ultimately and they physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that's what we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's close to the forty fifty percent something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other end identical twins where it apart or identical twins who different some white\nAnd help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and manage disease [noise]\nYou've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subjects of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets identical male twins were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight\nOne pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of those little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota at the same hospital as the other twins were born and somehow an amazing twist of fate\nWeek later so they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota and somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life histories are amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north\nSo even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary [noise]\nSo what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small a sample I Know but yes\nBut it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things in terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in the small town who should have been raised in Bogota\nWent and got himself a GED a high school diploma and is now finishing law school so we always had to drive you didn't have the opportunity but I have also become very appreciative of extreme environments and how they influence behavior I think that this is a very telling case and so many ways", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city":
