the moon to NASA and around the world just after the Apollo eleven lunar module commanded by Neil Armstrong became the first manned spacecraft to land on the moon moments later Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon and said these now famous words\n[noise]\n\nThat was fifty years ago when NASA didn't have the computer technology we have today\nAnd that makes a successful moon landing even more remarkable I guess ... directed the new movie first men based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and took incredible risks to test new spacecraft and fly to them and\nI'm sure has played by Ryan Gosling who also starred in the movie musical Lala land which does al wrote and directed to do one of the best director Oscar for that film he also wrote and directed whiplash let's start with a scene from first man astronaut Neil Armstrong my call\nIn sixty nine taking questions from reporters before embarking on their Apollo eleven mission to the moon\nNeil if it does turn now\nYou'll go down in history what kind of tossed you have about that one I thought it to a guy suppose that flight successful we're planning on that flight means successful uh [noise] I I just met how you feel about\nBeing a part of history I think I can shed some light here the responsibility but\nIt's exciting to be the first in my wife is excited to keep slipping jewelry into my care [noise]\nYou're planning on taking summer job or to the new buzz sure\nWhat what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise] Neal when you take anything\nA bad choice they take more fuel\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was\nWhat [laughter] why would someone who's so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut and space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know ... it didn't really line up with sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region Hansen's are incredible book movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar seem addict terrain at least to a\nWhiplash inland and and uh but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing you know the sort of journey from the kind of intimate home life on the ground to the story of extremes of human experience out in space\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you'd get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense than than the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be\nThe knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he's really experiencing all of the uh just orientation\nAnd just physical jostling of all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw lap Horton question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting ... from ... we had to take a we had to take a moment no we got us actually all very\nA a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can ... so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan's that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at\nAll inside the space caps on a recent lessons and said can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nWell I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of a uh making its way up there so something like uh\nReality for that are in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is this is a piece by piece a hand built\nMachine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMassive puts together a press state and about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space helping their land on the moon but if they don't just in case they download NASA's preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release your edgy um did get that actually happen\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of you know the the sort of had it on the coffee or and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nYear and Heinz who plays ... in the movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in and pay for 'em or that you can uh again that you can find online and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given but in a wading caps elites in such a poetic beautiful way the\nWillingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what they intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe\nIs that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nA live their lives have been seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people with\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed the new film first

moon or during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the lunar surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about\nSo what he himself would be seeing as he first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater\nDuring which point he is spent time alone away from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase the not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess just gave me inches down he directed the new movie first man and wrote

learned Morris Goto meeting dot com\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Damien ... he wrote and directed la la land and whiplash and directed the new movie first men starring Ryan Gosling has Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think is a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay\nSo it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect and he'll Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\n... version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nKnow I was a I was fascinated by it you know there was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a ... book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know or so little known there were also more famous ... music that ah that Neal and so the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece for divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a the Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no wonder Mitch control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real can actually do except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the ... you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to ah\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and why\nWhy don't we hear a a little bit on the record that we've been talking about we just call miner Rhapsody [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh um\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNo no [noise]\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the weight of the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... lots of direct did not on land and ready to and also wrote and directed flash\nOn a ... than remarkable was that you were working on love and land before first man but a lot of them was a turnaround sound like you hadn't really be done shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man er and er so you know that that was you know a few\nYears until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know ...\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during and after that\nAnd said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so the I Love Gene Kelly and we talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and it was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicas unreal size and then miniatures it it's it's\nYou know la la land was a complex film but that's because of like the choreography and the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean uh I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know as it was a little bit the the the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat a a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they went to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get a riot and pay proper tribute to
