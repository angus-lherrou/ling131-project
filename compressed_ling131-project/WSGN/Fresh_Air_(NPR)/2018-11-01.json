harder but my body remains still on losing Rosen\nFeels like a heavy weight strapped on like chef [noise] only my neck response barely along red clock numbers on the lights I Want to call out I Try to stay [noise]\nBut\nMy lips will move even my eyes stops blinking here are absolute other countries and I know\nThere's such a thing as sleep paralysis my mother told me about it she said at night but apple has demeaning\nAnd evil takes control if you make the wrong song\nI had a lab or the mom\nWhen I turned by it and I see the man waiting in my chair studying me\nDay off the dark path\nWe chased a long shadow will be in the studios and step judgments underground lair meat has to be with her\nYou made the seasons change cannot hold we've probably present boot not\nTrapped\nPlanning was from Washington\nTo be afraid to speak of spring and\nDon't turn out a lot of cars scoop stop\n\nIn in ... in their own home addict or under the bed but this next tale that happens to our storyteller when he was very very far from all\nTakes place in Baghdad the time when American troops particularly unpopular in that city you soldier in Dallas Sanchez that's been deployed as part of a sniper kill team [noise]\n[noise]\nBaghdad [noise] um [noise] that that was insane Baghdad was really intense [noise] uh Baghdad was just a constant sensory\nOverload [noise]\nTons of extrajudicial killings you could not leave survive without finding like a dead body face down in the trash while 'cause there's no infrastructure so talk about like the smell of\nThe city it smelled like death it smell like old death [noise]\nThis is the end of the oh six the war going on for three years and we were in a really\nHot area of operation\nIt was so close to the Green Zone that it was a super super Kush fob [noise]\nWe actually have like ... it's like a room maybe a ten by twelve foot rectangle we decorated it I had my little bad actually had a literary live in Berlin poster\nWhen you're in the service not just downrange I think that those little living spaces it feels like a cocoon\nYou know it feels like you're a little bit safer [noise]\nThis was around Christmas Time uh and I was six and I'm like the mission that we were out on was a concurrent\nAs Katie's sorry [laughter]\nEscape G. or a small kill team or sniper killed team [noise]\nLike the basic tactical would be we would leave the fall of\nVery very late at night in trucks\nRoll around the neighborhood with the lights out for several hours the trucks would slow down\nTo a crawl and we would try and like a silently open the doors just a just mount from the truck without slamming anything or making any noise walk through the neighborhood as ... as you can we reached like the target house [noise]\nBasically from there you just just break in [noise]\nAnd then a set of hide and just pull over watch over the sector and just wait basically for someone to do something a grimy like digging a hole to bury an ID\nAnd then a weed respond accordingly\nAnyways yeah we would have probably at least six hours notice that we were going to be a stepping off\nGenerally before heading out on whether you think that you would see her like you remember anything about those moments\nThat I can remember one time and it ended up becoming a pre mission ritual 'cause ... had a really great sound system and he'd be like dude we're about to get pumped up for this mission press play [noise]\nBeing in the ... decibels just cranking that out then and the jets became more Hampton\n... like your hundred and twenty pounds worth of kids and scrambled to the top of the truck get your weapon mounted [noise]\nI was a gun I had my head about the top just a scanning scanning like a maniac when you're moving across hoping ground malls scanning\nSweating profusely I mean like I I notice\nPublic radio since analogy you've probably never make it on air but it really is like just doing is that rail [noise]\nTo have eight guys moving in a in a file of through a neighborhood it's it's the point of the mission where you're most expose where you're most vulnerable\nYou have to maintain almost complete silence because aside from the sound of the wind maybe some dogs barking there is no sound\nLike so for Seventy two hours straight slide basically like I'm being in church because any sounds could like compromise you and potentially get every body that you love killed\nAt the moment that this story takes place how long had you been in country or how many of these have you been\nSo this was probably the seventh or eighth mission that I'd been on the mission started out typically it felt completely the same as any other mission\nSo it's probably like a around midnight or one in one or two o'clock in the morning we approached the building and before I've even gotten like a chance to drop my rock\nLike my best friend comes up to me and uh he just looks really shook him up\n\nAnd he's like do there's something wrong here there's just something bizarre so immediately and walking in this place the first thing that I noticed was Sam [noise]\nAmazing stories pulls directly by the people that lived up they look like now on apple pie cast for ever you get your part that our sensors continues his amazing story right back after this message day [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOne year ago the me too movement draw

T small kill team in Baghdad he's out in the middle of the night on a mission\nIn an abandoned building independents time Dallas and some of the guys who are looting the place and suddenly Dallas finds himself separated from his team and trapped on an iron gate speech [noise]\nThe neighborhood where we were in Baghdad outdoor there like a death squads basically roving the neighborhood and if they saw someone alone they just you come up to ... to the nearest\nTrash pile and put two rounds into the back of your head [noise] but\nI have a group I was like I don't care at this point I'm going to look for all this gate open I grabbed the gate with both\nHands injury shoved it is violently is a good [noise]\nAnd nothing it felt like shutting on a brick wall or rubber shaking a little bit\n[noise]\nI turned my light off and I stood there like at the mouth that game [noise] so I could see into\nThe opening of the court your where there's a little bit of moonlight\nCasting a shadow [noise] so and that's the only light source at this moment I can\n[noise] had like a sweat\nComing out of every pore in my body is you can't like pant you can't like like a dog be scared or whatever in situations like that like silence is so important so it's like a controlled hyper ventilation [noise]\nUh\nI lost my nerves such that I Would compromise or as Katie just speaks volumes about how\n[noise] I was the alternate\nGovernor ...\nAnd I have flawed automatic weapons the casualty causing weapon on\nRoad between eight and a thousand rounds onto the tea\nAgainst any physical for it but in this instance it's completely worthless [noise]\nReally tower [noise] whatever with their whatever was liquor [noise] in [noise] just did not want us there [noise]\nEspecially with us down there rooting through all of their stuff is just wrong whatever whether they're wanted all of us so I stood there for maybe thirty seconds and I just gave up hope and just resign myself to the fear\n[noise]\nAnd the gate just trusted open [noise]\n\nJust completely silently just cycle whale oil hinges the gate just drifts open right in front of me [noise]\n\nAnd I thought I had chills before I thought that I was scared before but [noise] in that moment [noise] it just [noise] I just could not explain what would cause that thing to drift open [noise]\n\nIt just warrantless gone like it at the end of the day when we went in there [noise]\nIt's with a malicious intent like uh we're we're set up in the building\nJust a an invisible force\nWaiting for someone to violate like uh the rules of engagement so that we could kill them [noise]\nSo I came out of that\nIt only son out like my best friend just unload on him [noise]\nAnd I get to him and I was like in a whisper in in whisper mode like what the hell is wrong with you do why would you do that but she had no idea what I was talking about for a serious concern we went and checked it out everybody came out all in together\nAnd that was it [noise]\n[noise] or as the sun comes of the gun trucks full of and we exit the building [noise]\nThis is how just stupid\nYou are at Twenty years old those paintings they stayed in Iraq I brought those things that\n\nSo I'm back in my room in the barracks and take these things out and I'm like hey check out these ... paintings that I got in a ... our platoon medic is

really special to you\nI'd really like for you to have this in a cave it away\nPart of new ideas I'm Sorry I'm just finding a way that that had no military um\nThat wouldn't come into way way later now looking back all of these years later I have a lot of respect for whatever that thing was it was able to scare me I felt like any ways like I I got my come up at\nFive months after this whole episode in may when I got hit by a V. bed or car bomb [noise]\nTry to rationalize I don't want to believe that something is here messing with me\nOn the weekends when cat and micro with him friend never mentioned the things he experienced he didn't want them to get scared away but still\nCat in might can help pick up on the fact that something was off about the apartment or you can see things at at the corner of your eyes and as soon as it turns them nothing would be there\nI could barely ever sleep so I'm lying in bed awake [noise]\nUh [noise]\nWith my door open hallway laid on trying

I remember we were so excited\nTo bring the cat home [noise]\nShe was just such a warm three kittens\nNot going up next to him but then something happens\nMy bedroom was always dark dingy I remember we painted clouds all over my walls to try to break it up and make it feel a little more cheery and but I still had this feeling of dread Everytime I go into my bedroom [noise]\nCatch it had to release his head recurring nightmares [noise] there would be a man standing over my bad staring down at me watching me sleep and he would take his fingers and run them down the flash on my\nFace and I began waking up with scratches on my face [noise]\nAt first I thought they may be scratching his Dodgers face [noise]\nBut she was in my dad decided that he was going to try something to see if this would help because I think he was worried that it was a self inflicted\nKind of scratch and [noise] she decided to tape mittens to me at night to see if\nI could stop myself from scratching and still I Would wake up with scratches down my face [noise]\nI almost feel like this thing was kind of feeding on our energy we were in a bad state we all were traumatized we had a lot of negative things going on in our lives it was a it was a bad transition for for all of us [noise]\nAnd I think that definitely awoke whatever was there and made things worse\nCat and make were close and he managed to find comfort in each other and things at the apartment got to be too much\nWeekends at the apartment my dad and I would go out all day we would spend the day outside doing fun things just trying to
