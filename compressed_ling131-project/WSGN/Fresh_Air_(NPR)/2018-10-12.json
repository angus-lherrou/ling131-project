understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with the me too movement it's spread beyond campuses what'd you Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how ...\nRepublican senators and the Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses what'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what did take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by us the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about\nSexual assault\nYeah if ... senators had um ban on college campuses as presidents or administrators are title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is very few women make it up\nVery few women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight something like not\nHaving reported for many years is not a big deal most sexual assault survivors and don't actually report for awhile and they would know that\nThey

B. H um public radio for the heart of Alabama\nThis is fresh air and let's get back to my interview with the nest egg regarding artists author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years\nWere talking to people on college campuses there was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students said to me that they weren't\nAnd it ration 'em by\nThe end of the three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual object I mean they were\nThinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this as you understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you've got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time\nSo why were you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that\nEnergy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people nuts part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness what do you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until they end up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise]\nUm but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances and you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness\nSo this is a little dorky okay ... ... it definitely changes\nYou know guys try to come up and danced with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean why his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nWas that the first time that happened here that was definitely for stuck up for it to me\nI mean I I yeah I I didn't\nThink that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I married um I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to how that happened and to have young girls who\nTruly a you know art in night clubs or app dance parties a lot understand like this is my buddy I own at people have to ask permission to touch
