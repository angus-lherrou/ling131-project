jak horsemen was created by my gas ... Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe series satirized is Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism season five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that is a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut when season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of a sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rose show\n[noise] the Nineteen any ... situation\nThe way this priorities we agreed to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and ... and not good\nBut the family comedy struggle corporate America someone on the air for nine seasons star of horses around ... is our guest welcome bow jak\nIt is good to be here Charlie\n[laughter] ... Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYes we were leaving you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be excused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and all of sorry oh and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by pat ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations are against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause it wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose ... and and all the women that he\nAllegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and having to be the washed up star of the family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I have been friends with her since high school I mean when I was you know ... in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nUm she was living in Brooklyn at the time and one thing she was doing was drawing these animal people on her own and and posting them in her blog and on the Internet\nWell let's say it's so lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability like he's not actively\nKilling himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and spoke maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed in despair and that he was willing to do this but not so much that he is going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him and during the last period of her life she had really\nEulogy for her so he's at a podium at uh my uh coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in the family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was means and his mother and they were both means about Jack\nI I Want to play a brief part of his ... and this is well or not as much jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horse around seriously though hold your applause well held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lande and it was about these orphans in early on the network had a new maybe don't mentioned they're\nOrphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not ... but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to launch for\nAnyway we did this one season finale where Libya is birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she wants to be in Olivia's life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of all of you and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the worst tries to want to be careful\nMoms that the way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with\nThe network really juiced cliffhanger is Olivia gone for good and then of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T.\nAlbum to cast a stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou can't have happy endings in sitcoms and not really because if everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there's nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad\nYou can take it on that and their parents anyway um what made you think about\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement west so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the we\nFor sure\nBut we forgive you were wards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nIt one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season last year or last summer we were talking about house additive\nIt was and the rate was kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that\nAnd then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we're forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again\nWell uh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know we see K. A. a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ... Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bull jak horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new collection of Eleanor Roosevelt advice column and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\nThe new ... our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Prime video with the Roman ... new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John flattery Amanda pee all riser and Catherine hon I knew it\nEarning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at our oh eighty scholar dot org slash retreats\nMm mhm mhm mhm\nJoin us for two hours of great jazz each week night from eight to ten here at public radio for the heart of Alabama your NPR station Ninety point three definitely ...

S. um tell us a little bit about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I'd sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in\nUm she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of ... that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah says happy Halloween because it's missing an end\nOf the the misfit toys go um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... Semitism and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened ah and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are ...\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know it's actually one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nYes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in it\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave and you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid\nSo I Love making people laugh but a lot of it too was I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing\nAnd then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shelling out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a well you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to save his things so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other\nA mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nAnd it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean ... I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space where are you where you can like unless yourself on TV and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references\nAnd bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation\nWas maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in feel\nLike the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold on to those who don't have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for it by putting it in the story later so having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running low\nJak witches Netflix theories none of Comedy Central is rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you because you in retrospect feel like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out\nUm but I also think look this is the show and it has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing that looks will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much it is my pleasure thank you so much\n...

R. G. and thank you\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross back with more of one of our favorite recent interviews our interview with Andre Holland he started moonlight the Nick Selma and forty two and stars in the Stephen King inspired series castle rock\nI spoke with him in August twenty Eighteen when he was in London at Shakespeare's Globe theater playing the title role of Othello\nWhen we left off he just share to form an event from growing up in Alabama won when his cousin burglar rise to store and was shot in the back by the owner and died the store owner who was white was Andre Holland baseball coach at the time\nThe other story it was one Hollande gave his fourth grade crush a Valentine and she wrote back and nasty note using a racial slur\nThe school that you want to we got that Valentine's that horrible Valentine was that an integrated school\nIt was a Christian school so it was meant to be integrated but it actually there were two a black students at the school myself in a while ago yeah uh-huh why did your parents choose to send you to that school\nWould think it was the public the public schools that ozone for uh they weren't they weren't good there they were quite dangerous and I went to the public school for a year and in the year I think I may be brought up\nAnd if you go to a school bus tomorrow without a book you going to be in big trouble you know but I you know I still managed to make all days and it just wasn't a challenging environment you know and\nA lot of my friends would doing things that you know gangs will be back then so people were joining gangs and fighting and doing stuff and my parents could see it see it coming and so they wanted me to go to a school that was different from that and so um that's why they sent me terribly\nAlso process saying that your baseball card shot your cousin in the back [noise] um what what is your relationship with the baseball college after that I Can't imagine being coached by him after he shot your your cousin\nYeah I wasn't I didn't play any more on that team uh\nWe we ended up I ended up playing it someplace else but I still on around you know we I played baseball all the time going up and so I you know we we were still we would come into contact with one another from time to time\nIt was the coach ever punished\nI don't believe so um I mean this was many years ago and and you know I was Seventeen at the time but I don't believe he ever was punished\nHuh I must have been really frightening for you know\nYeah it you know it was but was this is an interesting theory them learn about myself as that you know it it was frightening but I think that I got very good at\nPutting those feelings away mhm um whenever these things would happen you know a ... basically the same thing I deal with that with that stupid Valentine's card I just took that away in a drawer somewhere you know what I mean\nYou held onto the cat that like like yeah yeah but I yeah I mean I Know and\nAnd uh so that nobody else could see you know and\nAnd it felt in my mind sort of survival and progression so dependent on nobody else being able to see it and I did the same thing with the with those feelings having and it's only now in recent years I think that I'm I'm really starting to look at how those things\nAre have continued to affect me in my in my adult life\nAs a stage Ben the stage and in front of the camera been safe places for you to express feelings that you never felt comfortable expressing in real life anti drawn experiences that you've kept tucked away\nAbsolutely absolutely and this this play I'm doing right now um there's an opportunity to express a lot a lot of that which is really uncomfortable\nYeah exactly as is rage and as a and his grief and I think all ... and I think also his um that experience of of\nI mean look the other was a guy who you know has assimilated into society that's not his own and one of the reasons that he's been allowed to assimilate is because these people consider him to be valuable you know I'm as a general as he is he sort of you know lead their army and and uh\nAnd that I Believe is one of the reasons that he's allowed to continue his relationship with as the mon but\nYou know what is that due to a person you know who's living\nSort of straddling these two worlds one has his own and one that he wants to be a part of but he knows a desk conditional and I I Know what that experience is you know going to private schools where\nYou know I was sort of told well you've been chosen to be you're lucky to be here and at the same time be until well you're not like those other other you know black boys from your neighborhood\nBut no one in my heart that I absolutely and just like those by boys in my neighborhood they're to me so feeling that sort of I guess you know gratitude an acceptance of opportunity but at the same time I'm\nA anger and frustration at the short sighted in this other people who are giving those those opportunities and being sort of trapped in in that middle places is something I'm interested in exploring with with a fellow and also you know with myself\n[noise] I'm In a movie Selma about the civil rights movement you played Andrew Young um who had been executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference later became a congressman from Georgia a narrow Atlanta [noise] your mother worked for him right ... yeah\nShe worked actually uh he shared an office with another gentleman and so she worked with that gentleman but got to know Andrew Young quite well during the voter voter education project\nUh-huh so did she tell you a lot of stories about the civil rights movement\nOh yeah oh yeah she and my dad are both do um [noise]\nYeah in fact ... my family owns a um an has on for quite some time a funeral home ... funeral travel that is adjacent to sixteen street Baptist church in Birmingham and um\nThe church where that was dynamite it like a white racist where they climb members are just um yeah I yeah unaffiliated racist I think that yeah\nWere killed in that bomb exactly it's one of the like really infamous incidents of the civil rights era [noise] um so anyway see your family had a funeral home across the street from where the girls buried and that's you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Gadsden", "day":
