Patel\nHill received Oscar nominations for best supporting actor for his dramatic roles and money ball and the wolf of Wall Street this year he co starred in the ... film don't worry he won't get far on foot and he starts with Emma Stone in the new Netflix series maniac\nJonah Hill just made is directing debut with the new film mid nineties which he also wrote it's about a subculture of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill was a self described not great skate border but hung out with a group of much better skate boarders\nThe film isn't autobiographical but it draws on his memories\nThe film was told from the point of view of a boy played by the eleven year old son ...\nWho wants to be a skateboard or and be accepted by the older skaters he admires the take life threatening risks with skate tricks and stunts and spend the rest of their time smoking drinking and trash talking the skaters are played by pros but the skin\nOh welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie when did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nI'm no ambassador for skateboarding and skateboarding so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I don't know just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with or aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\nOf ... is that you're in like you were going to be a great skateboard are but you\nKnow I yes exactly okay and I loved it and it was there was such bombastic personality such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens on it having written this film\nHe really showed me you know a lot of what I think was great about it and what are things that I had to and people from that time had to unlearn\nWhat or something and you felt you had to learn from that country the way people spoke to one another and what they said to one another especially in regards to homophobia and toxic masculinity\nRecklessness which are related to you and I related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community is has the flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up in and learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise]\nAh yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nOkay I shouldn't use or dream would you unreality [laughter] every considered an escape or now I landed a kick foot in front of our cast and crew\nBut be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation\nIt's said among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in\nAfter the break this is fresh air\n[noise] I\nGoing to say we can we [noise]\nOn November sixth the campaigning and when and what will it mean for the country mind out with live election results and analysis from around the U.S [noise] critical elections central covered in our new [noise] Tuesday November six that's seven pm on WB H um\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting whenever\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignored the content matter of certain thoughts that I maybe should have waited till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho was who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be\nShe's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael way to Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but I Would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is\nA K [laughter] I like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like [laughter] when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah\nLenny and Carl homers friends from work were when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that\nYou have the um fishing or the or\nOr even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things I I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see\n'em they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids\nAnd you cannot see a clockwork orange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie and it's a seminal\nMovie in my life kids was a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope\nAnd those are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nThis is about kids skateboarding in New York\nI completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot and part of the film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] it's like\nYou know like a law saying what he was tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this done it for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best\nI think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties\nWe'll talk more after a break and Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American his murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi

filmmaker Morgan novel on Orson Welles\nNext time on studio ... Saturday afternoon from one to two on WBAL Jim\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatic lows\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me\nAnd then and Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir money ball\nAnd then in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy just doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am and I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker\nFilmmaking careers I looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny A's off played by you\nWho eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene [noise]\n... yeah [noise]\nRight [noise] I mean I don't think it was built for what you actually see that call around I see around\nWhen the only thing I think we live in a same building to swallow food yeah well for your forceful as a little ...

things about him to like his phosphorus and white T if I got to deal with your wife back to one rooms with clear lenses just to look more wash\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\n[noise] I just want to see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge or characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly\nThings and you still find humanity and then and I like how\nUnabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do and you're in a movie which is I think something that really speaks to meet in\nArt in general and something I'm going to strive to do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to leave it back to The Simpsons I mean our country\nAs a parable father ... father [laughter] you can't be viewed but he also incidentally loving big hearted\nPerson right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with step mother\nHad a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa Bayer and she's trying to make you stop\nInappropriate inappropriate she wasn't even beyond the drive over my nightmares will take place in Syria is very gross [laughter]\nMaybe you don't want to let me one of them [noise]\nAnd ... are you on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to hear this moment\nOh it's just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail\nAnd understanding but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first I'm this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something\n[noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in clapped his one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style and I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that has a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell known health thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great to talk with you thank you to\nJonah Hill wrote and directed the new film mid nineties\nAfter we take a short break marine card and we'll review a new book about Emmett Till a

B. H um public radio for the heart of Alabama\nIs fresh air and Terry Gross the Supreme Court has changed during the Trump Administration the court now has to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch who replace the late Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell block President Obama from choosing Scully a successor\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justice is\nMy guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so the justice as the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as past justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration [noise]\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court\nThe main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict tallies justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for a\nWhile on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and enduring for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nCourt docket is almost entirely discretionary the justice decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left\nTo the political branches that cheaply means Congress or state legislatures and they do so for a variety of reasons but I I think the thread that runs through [noise]\nThe views of most justices most of the time and I interviewed a majority of them for this book I interviewed them on background I can indicate which ones I interview that was the terms of the deal I the attitude you get is if not us who will do so\nSome will look out the window in point that the capital\nAnd say look at the dysfunctional Congress they'll make reference is veiled and otherwise to the presidency ah these days and that is a kind of arrogance that is remarkable to me I don't recall any part of the Constitution's stating\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece\nI think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn it even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases that if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true partisan shelf\nIn that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nThey're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nOr or the Republican interest or their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving settled that they're all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\n[noise] I don't know if this was after last February or not but last February there was a New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and\nSome folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige\nI think it helps to uh in the ... Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street will act and I also think it\nIt distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault\nAre you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that ...\nI think they're all kinds of legitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can do anything at that point other than tweet so I think\nBy and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\n[noise] I hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nComes first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and you say some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\n... milk toast to lactic guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course that nomination why was he called ... ... ... to lack that\nOh ... they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives want an instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we I won't go into details on but he wrote\nAnd quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do or the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst him not happen to think that cabin on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the capital will be you're closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional is him his affection for the court and for its own reputation may\nLead him in ... on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way the chief justice did decisively show\nThe Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then in that direction than for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David a caplin former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author of the new book

Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved so often it raises the stakes\nOf who sits on the court so if the\nAt ... how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't always that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples to those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think the political ... politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court\nPack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House and twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals than an eleven member court you have a six by majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your theater Ginsburg now eighty five and how old was a jump all Stevens when he left\nNinety yes so ... you can say for a really long time um\nSo a lot of people already ... it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written 'em in the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was ...\nYou know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have\nWell would lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single\nTerm of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I endorse\nI think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make current justices leave it would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen [noise]\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be um nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve then you might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court is a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice\nBut that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority the system might look\nMore like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not\nA new issue it's just far more dramatic than it used to be and it cuts against what we all learned in civics class which is that the law is supposed to be neutral where government of laws not men and women and so forth having said all that any of these changes are incredibly unrealistic\nBut they have a Kevin thank you so much for talking with us it's a pleasure thanks for having me\nDavid Kaplan is the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution after we take a short break can Tucker will review a new album I singer songwriter current via out this is fresh air [noise]\nRather young we go to rallies they got\nThe biggest", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "31"}
