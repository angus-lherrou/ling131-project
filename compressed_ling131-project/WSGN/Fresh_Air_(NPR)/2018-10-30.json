I was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nIt focuses on the story of Derek Black\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parent and the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with fast slow this morning\nHe likes that slow welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the ...\nBut it's still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find a black story relevant to the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter and when that straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body he had a tattoo\nUh fourteen eighty eight am to white national slogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word sort of statement of purpose that is central to what storm front does about um\nYou know securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at\nYou know in and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get get murdered them as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah the um ... ... hours had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and you know and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing\nAnd more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people or you know it's it's a ludicrous idea um but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement and now white genocide I Would say is probably at the top of the paradigm of white nationalist ideas\nThat's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In store front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nIs some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mash\nMostly that well this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our global with and are\nJews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\nSo you have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's heartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small\nWays culpable and he wanders them you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think the movement said to then have somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio um\nFor years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou like sad slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack of former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Jared black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\nGoing to say we can we [noise]\nOn November sixth the campaigning and when and what will it mean for the country mind out with live election results on analysis from around the U.S [noise] critical elections central covered in our new Tuesday November six seven pm on WB H um\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement going to be here\nOne of the young leaders of the movement before we now in seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers their ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included Sasha though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to is like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed\nSpace to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language and the safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the ... the word um\nRacial s a lot of our ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist\nTo white power to white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and\nWhite supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist in many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and

B. H M dot org now\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had because\nSociety was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that you know the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like what percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing that's a that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining because\nHe was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how do we going to define who's white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ...\nBy most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean we're\nListening to the interview

twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli sass low the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo Derrick one of the things you did you have been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise] let people know uh before\nAn article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black so after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found that you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy\nI I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew Shabaab dinners took the strategy that I think was a very very smart of it\nOr not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic because we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die about his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups there already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where I said this is this is crazy when you stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how hateful and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who uh who won one is trust built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and\nUh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him\nBut to build their relationship hoping that just by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative and I think\nIt's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the\nFull horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick headset Matthew in ... in between these dinners would sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid of beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and uh are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and\nSo ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in ... and that was the definitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\nMoshe ... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek it also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact that the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learned because of\nBecause of these incredibly diverse\nMovement can you explain to me how it's possible to believe in the first place that the Holocaust didn't happen\n\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air today Jonah Hill co star a super bad money

you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter] who is who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\nIs is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael wait at home or fire and no Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nLike Congress Diane Keaton like [laughter] what are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things I I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and\nYou cannot see a clockwork orange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids was a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house and I saw kids and I was like I Love skate boarding pass\nAnd the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood the HIV aids plot murder film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a life and what he was tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what ship you also about the ...\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they\nWere trying their best I think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry

films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you are interested in making that transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ...\nAnd then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir and money ball\nAnd then in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols are buried eleven center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nPlace and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain enjoy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese\nAnd written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO
