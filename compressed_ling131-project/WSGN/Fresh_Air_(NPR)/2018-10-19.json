B. H M public radio for the heart of Alabama\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspects hack schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and if he constructs the whole Donald Trump mess about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the attack schemes we talked about\nI'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar along from his father and helped parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\nOr we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct will that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also is the images of these were loans that were never repaired even he would take her out\nAnd we were looking at one particular your was like every month\nHe's going back to the him his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to do for Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increased\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch I'm sure it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of regarding those or which one is getting a million dollars from a day off to raise\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and\nAnd from his father\nYeah he used the money for many of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to his father is very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments could also see\nThat when his so you know when he would fall down was said to him it was there for the Trump safety there was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nIn the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without\nPlacing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money history and the million dollars worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips and at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father as well centrally and knew well\nAnd it was caught a soldier the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor fried Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump andme area and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it\nBut he makes this move some incredibly dramatic moving scoring to the family what he did so what you're saying I think is that at the end of ... life will toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump Salem South out and Fred from Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had help with so much money over so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that's retro perceive this as an attempt to Jane complete control over his state in the terms we use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly impatient builds over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab

R. G. this is fresh air I'm Terry Gross let's get back to my interview with ... Albert teen who was the guitarist and lyricist and the British Band the sleds was one of the first punk bands of women musicians and they defy preconceptions of how women should look and sound\nAlbert teens first memorial was called close close close music music music boys boys boys recent memoir called to throw away an open reflects on the anger of her ... days and her emotional life since then\nShe's been through a lot since the days of the sleds she was diagnosed with cancer three months after her daughter was born nearly died and became a single mother after her divorce\nShe still trying to comprehend her relationship with her mother who died a few years ago\n[noise] you know you write in your memoir to throw away on open that you've been married divorced in between had seven years of in fertility treatments Thirteen operations eleven ivy F attempts\nOne miscarriage one ectopic pregnancy or gall bladder removed cancer which was diagnosed three months after giving birth to your daughter\nDid all of us giving you a feeling of vulnerability about yourself and about things that could go wrong with your body after presenting this kind of angry and vulnerable image on stage when you were younger\n[noise] [noise] yeah the the image on stage was angry in invulnerable and I kept that with me even though I had those years of feeling lost all of the bond broke up [noise] um but when I got hit with old physical\nIllness and um problems which went on for about ten years\nIt did make me feel good um [noise] I never felt so good for my my mother brought me out to be very reckless and then suddenly ... will staring me in the face so literally I was lying in bed at night\nThinking you know I'm probably going to die I've got a six month old baby that saying that it's not looking good and um you know to face the specter of death on your mind that night there is no well the feeling like it is it's the most alone you'll ever feel um and [noise]\nPeople say off the ... you know you come back fighting and you come back grabbing every moment is if you know you've got no tomorrow and it gives you this courage it didn't do that to me maybe 'cause I lift those he is already feeling that I saw me felt all my\nBuild it back up and I was in the same person I I built a different person I'm a little circumspect a more compassionate person but certainly not the dead of all why both before what happened to all the anger that you had\nSuch remained [laughter] and so that to me was the threat of the second book why has this middle aged woman so full of anger why my ...\nSo it's interesting initially as a young woman you dealt with your anger through punk rock and expressing it through the music goes ... was a\nReal in your face kind of music um and now you're expressing your anger and its derivation in your writing um to really different ways of expressing it because you're writing you're doing it quietly\nWhen you're alone and there is no audience\n[noise] yes I Love that I mean I Love that it's just me and the page in the kitchen table and I I Love this a direct message just writing and I really like the long form of it as well as far as with songwriting it's three minute bus and they repeat every minute and I have to rhyme\nAnd have a ... billion health anymore not terrible on okay but it seems to be better to be able to work\nIn collaboration I I mean I'm not going to apologize for it I Love ... collaboration it it ... and frustrating and it will just down the project\n[noise] well a lot of your new memoir to throw away an open is about your relationship with your mother which was a a very complex relationship um me were very close also I'm and\nI'm gonna ask you to read a section that's titled do not resuscitate and this is about what you were thinking as your mother was dying\nI never all ... she was thinking during the last few months and hospital I didn't want to stir up ... suggesting huh but when it was so imminent in case she was frightened\nWe talked about her dying in the past but when the looks between a signal to the death was getting close I didn't want to appear too interested in the actual process and treated like a specimen to be analyzed but what was she thinking\nI was surprised she kept to drink books from the hospitals ... library why did she still want to read an increase our knowledge she only had a few days left as far as she knew what did she care about the second World War all the history of flight\nTo is all the books I can read in that time\nI think it's so interesting that your mother was still reading in the very end of her life and I think it's interesting that you wanted to know\nWhy why did she still want to learn it's a very ... central question I mean 'cause we're all going to die [laughter] yeah so at what point does do things like that lose their meaning if ever [noise]\nUm is there anything you want to say about that I think it's just such an interesting thing to yeah to think about\nIt was just extraordinary to watch it because she loves the rage and listen to the radio and I would have thought not truly you could still lie in bed and listen to the radio you post\nBut to keep soaking up knowledge because why are you going to take that knowledge there was no way that you know she was still putting in her brain knowing she had hours or days left on why was she going to take them knowledge about slavery hold a second vote will that it it it's still\n... mind boggling to me [noise] do you have you know in that passage you say that you didn't want to actually ask her about the process of dying even though you really wanted to know what you experiencing as you didn't want to scare her or or Turner into like an anthropology project the specimen um\nDo you think you did the right thing do you have any regrets about not having talked to her about it [noise]\nNo I don't I mean I think it was sensitive you that's plenty I Do regret I didn't say to him or I should have such a they always say say everything I Wish I'd think tumble\nAt one point she said to me well what do you remember about all the things I've told you to get advice I've given you and she wanted me to have a back you know the thing she told me my mind went blank absolutely blanket just stayed at her open mouth I have nothing\nYou know so there are moments I regret but I'm\nNot that one I'm Glad it didn't prove too much into what it felt like to do I mean you know she was my mom and my best friend and ... fall you can type but\nAfter her death you found one of her airline bags that she'd saved on which you'd written to throw away on open which of course became the title of your new memoir how did you decide whether to open that bag or throw it away as directed\nWas absolutely no decision of course I was going to open up [laughter] and I I I've spoken to some people said if you found a parent's bag and it said the ... on it is it just me or would you vote to every one of them who I'm not a rebellious as me I've also said of course\nI Am that I don't do what I'm told it was a provocation and I think in a way she did that to absolve herself of responsibility for what was inside the bag because in the eighth us you could always go back to me I told you know to open it of course I did what was in the back [noise] um and it",
