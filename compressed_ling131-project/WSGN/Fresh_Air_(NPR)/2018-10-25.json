adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wildlife how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with that [noise]\nUm I was a fan of Richard Ford's I just wrote a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called the court which is which is now closed looking for any other book of his opened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence\nOr even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not my I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nBut I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Paul dino we've probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and love and mercy now he directed his first film it an adaptation of the Richard Ford novel wildlife the

about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and this year you're a teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there\nAnd um there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also of incredible capitalist who comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and he become antagonist and in in one scene of the Morgan here he's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taking in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident and then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another\nAh oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they let us\nWe should [noise] are you

so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those courts like you'd you know how to play those quiet let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you to quit not Brian or a guy named area and isn't as bad as um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd saying we're doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan as his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing ... note um would you would say if you're playing a genealogy he's often emphasizing a different um note that in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound of the court\nAnd it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney got from the beach boys and started doing is a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time\nUm so for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing on the

is called wildlife and its adapted from a rich afford novel of the same name\nSo you started acting in community theater when you were how old [noise]\nAnd I started in school before that and then when we moved from Manhattan to Connecticut in third grade and probably shortly after that\nOkay at what point did you know you wanted to do this professionally [noise]\nBecause I started young I knew I did not want to go to conservatory after high school why did you do that because the young acting world it can be a little ... I think there were things that I was aware of that I felt like I don't know if that's the healthy um\nMoney celebrity exactly in a bubble exactly yeah\nI think I always needed the other part of my life which we which we don't often talk about 'cause it's not what reading somebody's interested in but like friends and music or like basketball you know like that's\nThe way to put it 'cause I was already a big part of my life so [noise] um I went to college is an English major\nBasically to kind of double check like hey let's let's make sure that you're just you know the the trains are already moving I Need is you know I could get off so to speak um I'd already done a film called LIE when I was sixteen\nIt did well for an independent film I was lucky to have an agent you know and and to sort of have a one little foot in the door\nBut I needed to know\nThat it was me and my choice\nA sort of studying something else being a diluted ... for a moment or you know reading the great Russian novels or whatever kind of helped me you know go okay you know what actually I miss [laughter] you know that and I like it and I want to do it and and frankly it was getting the part in a film called the balance of Jack and rose\nWhen I was Eighteen we something when I was Nineteen that Daniel Day Lewis was in\nAnd that was the first time on film I got to play a character that was not my ... like myself so to speak ... I just done a couple of parts or when I was like a dorky glasses which I you know sort of am in real life and I felt like I don't that's not acting to me like I don't want to just be a version of myself\nAnd I was worried because I didn't know yet that you had a choice to say yes or no part in getting somebody believing in me to play this part and ... oh I can be an actor like this is what I Want\nTo I was reading an interview with your partner silly ... than and congratulations you both have a little baby now [laughter] [noise]\nUm and and she was comparing some of the gender differences between her world is an address in your world as an actor so she said nine times out of ten in a rural she has to cry man that you rarely have to cry and that once in a dish and she had to have a gun and be tough\nAnd you've had a lot of additions that have been involved guns are being tough\nYou ever like I'm frustrated with the number of movies involving like guns and and and violence and\nWell yeah I Am personally you know even as a viewer\nAnd I've always myself chosen to look at it like\nThe ... part of it so yeah like a film like prisoners has violence right but I think that there's a sense of morality I actually think it's conflicted you know your lead character is responding in a violent way and I don't think it's looked upon you know with shiny eyes um that's I think maybe it's\nThere's a lot of violence but this is you know a story that that has a value and and also frankly like actually a little squeamish even though I Do a lot of dark material emotionally I um\nI don't respond well to to to just pilots for violence sake you know that's not my um so what does make you swim\nWell blood actually and I think the older I get the worse it is actually it's not like something where you become more it actually becomes more on easy for me especially now being a parent's right like seeing the first breath of life taken\nAnd to watch life expire so easily again and again you know on screen I Do think entertainment's okay though and and I just think it's about how people handle it right\nSo you know your your partner is that we can then just gave birth a couple of months ago um that's messy [laughter] well you squeamish about that\nWell I thought I Would be and I wasn't and I loved it I thought it was incredible I mean though he was the hard work yeah and uh

B. H M [noise]\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nSo in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's that's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nAssistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball but you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids\nThe thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coaches say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their ...\nIs extreme [noise] I'd say you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities\nAssistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you manage to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or can over those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports\nSpecial athletes manage their money or if you get traded their special issue will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with known quantities\nAnd part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go between set you up with a with players\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the

is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI I did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well and a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike chef ski coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to ...\nThe question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nWhat kind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe one of the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their\nLoyalty and their their responsibility is to their team first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through and not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the midst of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're therefore\nWhen it come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful\nSunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy you also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of\nWell activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know it will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on\nI certainly think with the FBI on that case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we cover this I mean ... you said that in some respects shoe and apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in\nThese charges the apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who this Adidas executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball inside or almost all of these defendants\nAre well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they are planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us\nThank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the
