I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I share the story more widely\nThat people must have asked you kids must have asked you all the time like how can your grandparents are raising humor as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories are my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean it may be bad for my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nReally your mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for young adults are though I'm an adult and I really liked it I I Would recommend is to adults but um why did you want to like target AT T on the ...\nNo [laughter] at the time\nI was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nAm I going to go back to school really care about [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise]\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather\nJust be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking you know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\nAny outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding shower was that Sunday and in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife she'd be over and and ah my mother my grandmother was hooked up to oxygen\nAnd we always have thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her notes oh gosh ... that's ... ... and we're so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and\nI and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because that took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes they are in there in the book and and those were difficult\nOf a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences but visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I'm ... I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school St building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help a stigmatized you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and\nThat's where for me are was such a saving grace because uh I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was mean that that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\n... says you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment uh and and back then this was the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot of a gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything you're about [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I

assured me that she was not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money\nAnd I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here and I really had to put some distance between us at\nThat point you know why I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nUh and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to run them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was just would have been in spring of two thousand sixteen and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will and you know you do I would worry I'd wake up in the middle of the night thinking\nWhat if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people\nJust she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know\nI'm a long in Detroit process from really going to need to talk to her about what I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing and I\nIt was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family and on Monday morning I went into the funeral home and Stephen who's the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there and\nI Know I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated by I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like well what do you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home so I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that you would wear the dress she wore to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house\nI Would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was response or you know I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly would be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks or shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mom beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find\nCouldn't find that dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits\nAnd and all all of a drug paraphernalia\nSo her boyfriend at the time said oh you know there's there's the cedar closet and this other ... right yeah of course a dress that was that important to her she would preserve and the cedar closet\nSo I ... I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is and on a little nicer than I saw him again and then on the lazy boy chair I saw three handguns and next so that was to handguns and now I'm realizing I'm On a room filled with handguns with my back\nIs this is exactly what I figured I step into so now I'm thinking what if I'd done what if I die here my children need me so I I made the boyfriend like I just\nNeed to be alone with my mother's things could you just give me a moment so he he moved and you know\nAs loud as I could I said well Steven you know the the dresses in here I'm just going to go to Macy's and uh by her address me and he just looked at me and he's like you sure we can keep looking at like\n... countries get richer [laughter] very quickly I said okay\nI Need to get my baby albums I Need to get this photo album and okay here's this painting I made for her ... as quickly as I could grabbing handfuls of things I wanted to hold onto in the event that the house blew up the next day\nUm wow and so now I'm I'm making preparations for my mother's memorial and we didn't publicize the memorial I didn't put in the newspaper till afterwards but now I'm really fearful this guy's going to turn up with with guns and so I hired security\nBut in the interim between that moment and and the memorial\nThat ... was arrested for impersonating a police officer so he had shop lifted a number of items from a Walmart like dog for the paper towels and he brandish a a gun and said no I'm I'm with the police and it's good and and and and come to find out all of those handguns were Bebe guns made to look like real guns\nUm and that but that didn't change\nMy heart was racing in that moment [laughter] so at her memorial\nAnd and even though I mean I was expecting there to be maybe ten people there but this this funeral home was filled with cousins my friends you know my on friends family friends who remember the good parts\nOf her [noise] All right let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jared J. ... he's the author of new graphic memoir he kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and outlets family addiction\nWe'll be right back after this is fresh air from the moment you wake up\nThrough the chaos of your busy morning [noise]\nMORNING EDITION six there with you [noise] [noise]\nProtesters threw all you have to do will bring you oh you need to know every week on MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nRio de mornings from five to nine Ninety point three W.
