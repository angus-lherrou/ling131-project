in twenty sixteen Rick Gates then deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump\nRequested proposals from an Israeli company to create fake online identities and use social media manipulation to help defeat Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination in the primary and Hillary Clinton and the general election\nThe proposals were apparently never acted on but we know that Russian operatives made effective using Facebook and Twitter and seeking to influence the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nOur country is hardly the only one in which political opinions have been manipulated by millions a fake social media accounts promoting messages that are slanted or even made up\nOur guest today pi Wu singer and Emerson Brookings say that social media has also been weaponized in ways that most of us remain unaware of\nLike fueling popular uprisings and affecting the course of military campaigns\nFor instance when the Israeli Army moved into Gaza and twenty twelve the operation was supported by a viral marketing campaign\nVW singer as a strategist at New America a consultant for the u._s.\nAbout conflict and social media and was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations especially as Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWell pi Wu singer and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air\nYou know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in this book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming a military offensive this was the German invasion of France what happened\n[noise] so you had this new technology that are connected everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population was wireless communication\nAnd radio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes or the rise of Nazi ism Gobel a said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also hide strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France\nAn invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work it not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population and it's sporadic contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of these things that the contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figured out really radio was what a cause all cause the world to change\nAnd we saw many of the same things play out in the rise of ISIS at a broader level but also it's a military operation it surprise invasion of Iraq that allowed it to defeat a force that was a multiple times bigger as part of these ways the social media is in effect change the world\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in a credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict in social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations VW singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air [noise] mid\nElections are coming up every vote matters and every day matters to it can be hard to stay on top of it all\nNation for you listen to all things considered every afternoon here the bigger picture from NPR News [noise]\nWeekday afternoon from three to seven pm on Ninety point three W. B. H M public radio for the heart of Alabama\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson Brookings he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you look at the Israeli incursion into Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign\nAnd they were hip to the importance of this what do they do\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching and ever since [noise] uh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online\nViral marketing campaign the\nCampaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered then among us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... of one side or another ten million and all in this first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate\nIt was a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals remaking battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using the Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cars and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swiss army of swift ease you can enlist in the Israeli\nBut the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push the Amoss one pulls from the world at crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example ah you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head you would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion to drive it through your own ends the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson breaking authors of the new book like war

fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu senior strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nUh it was in a certain way you hide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where uh they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nThey wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kevin\nSmall ticket that then you add the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or a narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of law is it something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate Bush you know all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath this you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself for at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history Wikimedia so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to compete in very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook that it was sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge\nOf figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um and that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nWonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nThe challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not\nThe companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to a I'd battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks ... could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane\nOf speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an examples Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich are by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to a in essence create a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's going to be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...

is go to meeting dot com\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Damien ... he wrote and directed la la land and whiplash and directed the new movie first men starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the ... yes yeah yeah okay\nSo it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of a genre that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah I'm In is incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience\nOf like being on your plate of the moon and playing with like really corny [laughter]\n... version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nKnow I was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know those are learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a ... book the Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know or so little known there were also more famous ... music that uh that Neal and the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece for divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone or in space\nIf you're a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no damage control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real can actually do except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the ... you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI think why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about we just called me in a Rapid City [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh [laughter] oh [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nNo no [noise]\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... lots of direct did not on land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash\nUm and I think I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first men but a lot of them was a turnaround sound like you hadn't really be done shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man er and er so you know that that was the last few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know ...\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during and after that I was given this book\nBe interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so I Love Gene Kelly and we talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joy and the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you have to do you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules and space flight and creating like\nReplicas unreal size and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know raw land was a complex film but that's because of like the choreography and the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean uh uh I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat a A N and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they want to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself in all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned al thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our shown congratulations and thank you so nice to be back
