B. H um public radio for the heart of Alabama\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice\nTrump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and it kinda brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration\nStories that have been reported by Miller and other reporters at the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had no such immunity I was interested in that you used the word lying\nWe're lying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] is very controversial in the journalism world because lying implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways\nSo people are just weighing ... is is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment or you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post who was documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se car very complex\nPublic person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about a times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona and\nCall reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a there is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um you spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing siege by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news organization and many others\nAnd this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has who has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner\nAnd and officials from Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already a banana evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but he says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um\nThat he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him in that conversation than at adhering to the facts that had already been established\nGuest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post

national reporting now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia innocent version of American democracy\nMy understanding is that\nThere are members of the Trump Administration who have been told that they had to sign non disclosure agreements\nWhich means that they wouldn't be able to divulge anything to a reporter like you and if you called them\nAnd this is an attempt to prevent any kind of damaging information about the Trump Administration from from getting out to the public do you know when somebody you're speaking to has signed\nA non disclosure agreement\nSay I've ever encountered I'm somebody who has signed such agreement I Know that they exist in the White House I Know that they've um tried to offer financial inducement 'em to those who would be willing to sign them as they as they leave\nThe administration and move on 'em or morose it comes to mind um\nNo I I I I just think that's such a bizarre approach these are these are supposedly public officials they are they are are public servants there or not\nPresident Trump's public servants um the idea that anybody would be required to sign any kind of loyalty oath to him personally I'm is just goes against the grain of so many ah principles that it's hard to fathom\nSome people who want to just credit reports\nYou know lies false heads misdeeds say all those stories relying anonymous sources I'm not going to like chess I'm not going to trust and not an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are your guidelines\nFor using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really him in a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources\nUm for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources we would really be on April I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I wouldn't really say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the ... readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving handling of the information\nAbsolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well\nWhat does the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions and government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with source they are a source be but it's something you know ultimately this\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up\nThe stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect in ... and we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give me one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well\nUm there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer type supplemental to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation but Trump is also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\n... is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a job\nIll ah in jokes about how once reporter spends a little time in jail they're making new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving you don't make you afraid\nWell let me let me ... it\nWhether it made me afraid I ... I was confident enough\nIn my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back mhm um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening it's um\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders and vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nMiller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you\nGlad Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington

Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers Moneyball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany a central positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled\nAnd some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading Lewis started writing about this\nYou helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um\nStories and obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for him for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached said that he is secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his\nRough conversations with foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister\nLooks it looks like we're having a technical problem there and we played there on tape so we are now going to hear my interview with Michael Lewis sorry about that Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk that you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing that's actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nWell we know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who try to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who were brought in to try to explain how the department work to him\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything but trade so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission is apartment additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare as financial holdings ... when he was nominated for the job and it turned out he had\nTwo billion dollars less than the forms rich lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to think a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice if he was very odd choice\nWell if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nMy name is ... and I'm with medical properties trust we're proud supporter of Alabama radio reading service\n... and other things the station is doing it becomes kind of a fixture in the community you know people take things for granted and don't realize the moon each for to make sure that you can continue to give this tremendous levels for more\nInformation about the Alabama radio reading service visit WB H um dot org\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among others so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level\nAnd I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a triple a prize the biggest ... ... ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of of abuse and score and it's collected Ross and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nAnd is is having at it and nobody's paying much to nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving stores and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the ... a lot of the risk that the government\nIncome inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach and\nOn top of this enterprise has been has been for us this very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the sense that we ask that kind of spam includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did you find in the Commerce Department\n[noise] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and the national weather service titled National Weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so is there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department are and it does it eats most of the resources\nAnd it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nTowns actually like a good thing he runs a weather predictions are okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property a ... that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs the ... the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nJust mirrored right song what she found inspiration on the wall of the museum\nThere was this enormous Canada and it was ... it was passionate was sensual and was vital and angry and it made me cry and I couldn't walk away from it I really could not walk away from the\nStudio three sixty what's your inspiration Saturday afternoon from one to two on WBAL Jim\nI'm Jeremy hops in a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada a trade war with China a sky high stock markets and fears that a recession could be right around the corner will take it all up with Larry Summers former economic advisor to Presidents Clinton and Obama the next time around here and\nFrom noon to three point three WBAI Jim\nPublic radio for the heart of Alabama [noise]\nHe wanted lists of a name of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving them the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpreted as a hostile spirit\nI'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to engage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nYou know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works on its assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing pack at because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the ... people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel\nAnd approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River in poisons the whole Pacific Northwest\nAnd I thought Trump's approach is effectively taking it lots of you know one and a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it the column and diversity showed you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm doing what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets\n[noise] well I'm asking that question [laughter] what is it a question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next well I I Know that's not really your job but no it's not my job but you know if I ...\nI Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk\nThat he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say a Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back this is uh\nI like the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt\nI'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis uh so what if you're curious about the national crisis well because\nThe dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world with everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ...\nWhen they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nI'm Jeremy hops in the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada a trade war with China Sky high stock market and the rest of the recession could be right around the corner will take it all up with Larry Summers former economic advisor to President Clinton and Obama next time around here and\nAnd that's today\nFrom noon to three point three WB H in\nPublic radio for the heart of Alabama [noise]\n\nServing Cordova misses your NPR station\nSupport for ... comes from our members thank you and leave these fine jewelry on Second Avenue north specializing in antique an estate jewelry and loose diamonds since Nineteen twenty two information at two five one three three eight one\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump\nA lot of the government as a often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything supposed down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and\nI'm so lazy stupid people is it has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy change through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department of Commerce Department\nAnd I turned to having exactly the same experience that political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconception with vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like\nUm this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have cut up contempt veg contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be brief can be you know it'd be kind of informed by these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes\nIs is a mission driven person they're not paid well\nUh they're they're because they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids that people in the department of energy scientists about a passion for that particular size since they were little kids\n... essentially it's essentially what they are all these people are firefighters are in spirit and\nThere's something really moving about groups of people who were doing what they're doing not for money but from mission uh they they have a purpose in life and it just jumped off the page I mean it jumped is jumped into my mind\nAre they treated the this slice of our society these kinds of people who are really the best among us as badly as we have and", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "02"}
