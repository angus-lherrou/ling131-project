the good stuff so why can't we just come together and make it happen and it's really is better this way when you when you think about it from uh\nCertainly uh uh uh I I for listeners say yeah I it it ... why why are you asking the question is is that it's better that the people who listen to it helps supported finance it we're asking you to do your part\nWhatever that part is if you can uh if you can donate ... for an hour of fresh air at a hundred dollars that's that's great if you can do ten dollars a month that's fabulous to the point is\nWe are asking you to make an investment and do it and ... and ... and become an active part of your public radio station right now with your contribution eight hundred for for for\nPublic radio for the heart of Alabama [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross backers chef Lydia ... who's known for her PBS cooking shows her cookbooks and her restaurants her memoir is called my American Dream\nOr what [laughter] I Love in the book you basically become the cook for your family for dinner 'cause your mother's working that's a long commute and she doesn't get home early enough to prepare dinner\nSo so you're preparing dinners and then you start making like a Duncan Heinz cake from cake mix box and like you're totally fascinated with the idea of this well max and a boss\n[laughter] well you know it it made me so successful yes my mother worked late because first we settled in New Jersey\nAnd then we moved to a story I Am but she kept her job in Jersey because she was afraid she wouldn't get another job and so she came home just in time six o'clock for dinner and she would prepare for me just like a regular recipe you know the potatoes beans whatever it was that I was cooking put it in cook it half an hour\nAnd so on all the instructions so I Would do that but then I discovered the cake mixes these wonderful kind of boxes\nThat you added one leg to the mix or maybe some butter put it in the oven and will allow this this fluffy delicious cake would come out and then you know even the icing\nThey gave you on the side how to make the icing with powdered sugar or whatever so I was thrilled and I almost every night we had a cake for dessert now that was the good life for us you know we weren't used to that and it made me kind of oh an accomplished cooked I made a cake with every dinner and\n[laughter] we used to anything that sweet no no no we we didn't have that many sweets candies or that so the whole thing was kind of a discovery you became engaged\nAt age Eighteen to ... which you and your husband decided to open a restaurant in Queens New York\nUh without a tough choice for you because it's a big investment it's a big responsibility and you you never know what's going to happen when you start your own business\nBut you know um my husband he's also was an immigrant from the same area you have come before me as a as a man a young man and was working in restaurants or had worked up to being a major D.\nAnd ah taking challenges a I think maybe that was the beginning of of you know or to gather especially if you take it with somebody in the view of the same mind\nThen I had my my mother my father who always kind of with us in the same home they have their own apartment but live with us they encouraged to you know we'll help you or whatever so when you have the support and you see the opportunity the challenges you want to try\nAnd you're young and so we weren't really afraid although you know it took for this little restaurant nine table restaurant in in the suburbs of New York it took all of our savings ah then I ultimately ended up in the kitchen as a sous chef learning much more\nWas the menu and your first restaurant and Italian man you as you understood Italian food to be from having lived in Italy or within an Italian American as Americans understood [laughter] I tell ya da\n... was Italian American because you know we had worked in restaurants most of them were Italian American food\nUh we had done my research you know the successful Italian restaurants all had Italian American fare so we're gonna be different you know we are going to go along we hired an Italian American chef\nAnd that's when I became the sushi chef and worked with him in the kitchen and learned the Italian American cuisine and we were quite successful but but you know I must say that slowly I began adding some of the specialties that we ate at home\n[noise] so after having a restaurant in Queens you expanded that restaurant into the um store next door and then you can get another restaurant and then sold those to have a restaurant in Manhattan and why did you want one in Manhattan what does that signify tia well Manhattan\nWas the epicenter of this big city with everything that was sort of\nUp and coming in in in the world of style of music and the food and ah ... my husband had worked\nUh most of his time in Manhattan in a\nElegant Italian restaurants and sort of you know he's clientele oh Lindy in college and you need to come to Manhattan that's where you belong or your food then of course that was the drawl and also being in the big times if you will Manhattan was being in the center of everything in a sense and\nItalian woman chef that cooks odd Italian food", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "15"}
