injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and Adam Cohn wrote the introduction to it\nSo you were born in Nineteen Seventy to some of your father's most famous songs are already written and recorded by the time you were born Suzanne selling Marian had that's nowhere to say goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire 'em so\nI mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a song writer scene must have had an awareness that song writing my craft that something people actually did\nAnd the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them and you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see how I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and it's scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he's scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton\nThat he had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and do something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground [noise]\nHow old were you and your parents separated um five six from the don't remember so how much did you get\nTo see your father after that I'm In\nTwo people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow her own whims and my father you know would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nYou'd always he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nA caravan as like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the look what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing\nMhm okay yeah I remember my mother\nMoved my sister and I all the way to the south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things they\nPut it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of and\nHow long is it that far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate ... which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for um his reconnection to people [noise] um I I around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain your\nFather savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing his soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\n\nHe thought he could resolve his economic woes with a song and poetry I'm In ... incredible that [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time up since ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and\nUm but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics as liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets so thank goodness for that economic crisis\nSo did he ever get the song writes back because I Know it really yeah those are\nMy guests a songwriter and singer Adam Cohen who is the son of Leonard Cohen Adam wrote the
