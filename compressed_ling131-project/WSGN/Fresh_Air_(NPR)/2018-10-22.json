B. H um public radio for the heart of Alabama\nIs fresh air I'm Terry Gross my guest Melissa McCarthy is known for her comic roles in movies like bridesmaids and the heat and for her impersonation of President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by the Israel\nIsrael who died and twenty four teen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to Lula Bankhead and gossip columnist Dorothy ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cat's vet bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like Dorothy Parker ed ... know coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote me Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nLet's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confides here\nScams in hospitals jak is played by Richard II grant each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor [noise]\nThat wants to all my friends who did [noise]\nQuite by accident I find myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminal position I come from [noise]\nLast criminal activity ... except ... I mean [noise] embellishing [noise]\nDocuments [noise]\nBeautiful dream check out\nLiterary letters writers little tricks low mother nature's\nVersus if you're not understanding the world of elite collectible literary artifacts are supposed to be fooled pieces of paper servers\nI Am selling to come home she getting [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the rock 'cause I get a better response because if you told runners [noise]\nThat's the only one without [laughter]\nMelissa McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on at this isn't really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter away\nBut it wasn't called a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um\nI think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh\nDid you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the Thirteen people at each performance do [laughter] I don't have much impact\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you very famous for his role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter]\nWhen the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um\nYou know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross that comedy\nThat way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to terminate ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what if the the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like ... look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I and then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] with him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes because your mind is really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but\nIt wasn't intended and it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults [laughter] insulting oh no [laughter]\nThe example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal and the the the other ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car did you say that\nThat's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do have to say All right you know to know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... in our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he called me\nOr what language Catherine language learning how to relay what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door so\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake couple let's say a big commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIs productive I Would like to read and my legs and kick you out in the jar with my ... bone just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner me I Will chew through you know through you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that's something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched\nThat back I kept saying I didn't say that I never say that and the person was sitting with with that said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of which made me feel slightly crazy there was just trying to say ... anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nOh see Asian that I didn't kind of law get into my memory how'd you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just that you literally say anything just to kind of kind of tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character at your very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean it would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and are there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\n[noise] and I guess as Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nAnd here's a song from the soundtrack of can you ever forgive me sun by blossom

and reading and math and reading on ... what our civics our democracy um matters a lot that's next time on here and now\nToday from noon to three on Ninety point three WBAI Jim ... radio for the heart of Alabama\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you is ending woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter]\nLike it just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shutter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on ...\nI hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I always kind of go down that road if like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take a shirt off and like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and saying times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh ... ever\nPresent or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light men\nFlashing it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I [noise]\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women and I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with corks in eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is and so often I I've I felt that everything I read for a female character was really bland and and\nOften a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like\nAll [laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and save the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just ...\nI'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange in climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now\n[noise] every little inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable\nYou know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and realize their strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars
