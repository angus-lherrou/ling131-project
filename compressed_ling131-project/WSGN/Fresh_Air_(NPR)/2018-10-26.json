talented athletes as young as twelve targeted for manipulation by St agents soccer love described as dealers in human athletic flash\nMany of those corrupt practices were exposed and an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but\nThe scandal cost him his job he's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college best\n... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generates billions\nI mean it really depends on how you calculate it put directly to the universities and to the NC double a billions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does the money go\nThe money largely goes to be adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches who make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nHow big is the NCAA a championship tournament March Madness\nJust about a billion dollars a year goes to the NC double a itself\nWhich is the non profit organization that runs big time college sports\nBut the money that that tournament throws off and all kinds of different directions is where you get into the two or three billion dollars it's the kind of money that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences that they're actually paying the players\nYou're right about the University of Louisville which you say it was kind of a quiet commuter school\nUntil a new athletic director guy named Tom Juravich came in and had big ambitions and invested in big time coaches and new facilities stadiums and basketball arenas and and made a ton of revenue from it did it have benefits for the rest of the school\nAnd they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as in a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life and one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business\nAnd scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\nYou followed our fall fund drive and you know ...

temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock and what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing\nParents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at present time that was a shock ...\nAnd has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n\nThink overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike chef ski coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean what kind of sports\nDoes not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe one of the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs\nAnd they're not real students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their team first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through and not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful and you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy you also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so\nJust common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit\nSo to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know it will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in\nThese charges the apparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who this ... executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider he's a basketball inside or almost all of these defendants\nAre well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big

not close one\nAs part of his research to Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives knew read cofounded the velvet underground which he played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen on many bands of the time were singing about peace love and hallucinogenic Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote songs that had a spiritual quality\nTo Curtis says other than Bob Dylan the Beatles and James Brown no one has exerted as great an influence on popular music as Reid has\nRead die of liver disease five years ago at the age of Seventy one\nTo Curtis says he wouldn't have written this book while Reid was alive quote this book does not at all times see Lou ...\nBut he came to be embarrassed about our discussion here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the sun heroin from the velvet underground first album\n\nMm\n\n[noise]\n\nMm\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThat's Lou Reed and Anthony Curtis welcome to fresh air and congratulations on your new biography of new read\nUm are you so much for pleasure bigger so let's start with that song which sums up so much about what may may Lou Reed different from other music\nUh being made it at that time um give us your take on heroin and how it fits into not only the reeds career but into the larger music of that time [noise]\nSuch a daring statement you know certainly was recorded in Nineteen sixty father came out in Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it were mentioned when\nYou mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I've got a con around the block\nSee anything he was kind of like flu it in his actual alley\nI mean one of his girlfriend's ah describes him as inter and [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and but I've had gay friends gay male\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of hoping to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did one guy I just wanted to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that\nBut when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family I have a price on Iran I ... yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap and she was saying a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all of these small places he would never ask his father for Monday and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever given their money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what\nLose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and you know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his arm he didn't have any money not set he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending have trans grass have is that [laughter] I'm not totally\nDon't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to jump by time in making money and if they were ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City [noise] um\nIt's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad [noise] um and you know he certainly would characterize them in song\nYou know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for a long lead\nLet's you know that's a very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know it says like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know an artist who had gone to see them and thought they might work for ... [noise]\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports as patient as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could have gotten the you know he kicked Nico has the band as well after having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was\nAnd you know I was a kid in New York or I'm antiwar who was in the newspapers all the time you're not\nYou know not art critics reading about it although that too but just like August crazy guy you know he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and you went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever you did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in a\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was pretty Ernest thing and we are we're whoa seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a bat and you know for for people who have entered them yet you don't hurt our amazing mirror so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline gear down and he's got to go you know that needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony to Curtis the author of the book Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback after a break we'll talk about\n... relationship with women including his wives and his trans partner Rachel I'm Terry Gross and ...

B. age I'm\n... I'm Peter O'Dowd a young Saudi dissident living in Canada worked with ... before his death to fight against Saudi propaganda on line he says to show she was like a father to\nIt would say condo [noise] I'd wanted to be hurt it's it's so difficult honestly I'm not going to stop you have to keep fighting that's next time you're in\nGood afternoon to one Ninety point three ...\nHis self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um\nYou know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David Bowie was kind of the you know the\nComing thing and uh you know bully you [laughter]\nYou know as with flu like there was a very conventional aspect of ... I mean much as he was a boundary breaker\nHe always you know kind of respected his elder CEO and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list and so he you know but we offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit 'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record um [noise] you know so little of course yeah once you got to hit that he desperately wanted you know kind of came to resented and\nYou know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player mc ... who co produced that album with ah with with David\nUh they created that song and also you know of other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are you know that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lu\nWho want to hear walk on that ... from that album and um this was his only\nReal like radio hit and it was a big ... I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it now\nCalling from Miami ... hitchhiked to weigh in on the list that he\nLoved her eyebrows on the way shave their legs and then he was uh she she says the they take a walk in the wild and said hey honey take a walk in the wild and\n[noise]\nCandy came from out on the island\nThat's read walk on the wild signing his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a head friendly but it's got I got from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know they were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you don't look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band did have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home you\nKnow more than more gone yeah\nYeah precisely and even if you did have hits you know you got a year or two and you look then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um\nEthics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted us to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so\nThe degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do pick another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record\n'em [noise] so you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo restore his standing once you have destroyed his dad you know because the next thing was\nAnd roll animal which was you know a big fmri\nBut then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just you know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that with ... before Lou did it and I'm\nJust I like I never wanted he wanted to have is music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm In his ... he said that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and\nYou know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nNo that was real she did that I mean essentially saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanting to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is who became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was as out there as anybody could be\nBut that much um [noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never\nDiscuss it [noise] you know so I I Want to play a different ... of St hassle but not to slip away part that you refer to sure but the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so cold just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great raining [noise]\nUm so this is the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle trying to say anything about this this part [noise] yeah I'm\nLewis drawing on the story of a guy who used to be around the factory he was found\nDead uh industry has been thought to be kind of thought he was hit by a car\nThat mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that the died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they got dragged out onto the street or just left\nHim by the docks I'm as if he had you know I had an accident of some kind of a blue turns that male character into a female character and then you know describes the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his guts to get\nThis girl's body out of his apartment [noise] let's hear it this is Lou Reed [noise]\nYou know I'm Glad that we're going in and it really was nice talking to that really missed it was more tends to be in\nThe bird would you know it can be had tried to explain to deplete jokes that I was there all the guys that are
