I had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and you know and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people uh you know it's it's a ludicrous idea um but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement and and now\nWhite genocide I Would say is probably at the top of the paradigm of white nationalist ideas\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In store front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nIs some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people\nThis probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the\nPeople who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and are Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um and I think that he's heartbroken uh and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens\nHe feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism plays into incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think that in the movement to then have somebody\nGoing to a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a ... I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked fast slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Jared black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nMy name is ... McLean with medical problems for us real proud supporter of Alabama radio reading\nWe have a social responsibility to support nonprofit public and private organizations to Alabama radio reading service to or touched a chord with us and makes is probably the one that we're helping to make a difference here in the community for more\nInformation about the Alabama radio reading service visit WBAI gems on board\nThis is fresh air to social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement we're going to hear an excerpt from the interview\nMovement before we now in seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers Derek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to you it's like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when we found that storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that wasn't what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it\nSay racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the what the Clintons to word um\nRacial s racial out all over\nThe years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and\nWhite supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear

around the world joining [noise]\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI I think it's important to note also that you know the entire ideology the ... point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what ... percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nEr and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nPeople in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're

air let's get back to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader who announced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli sass low the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you have been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise] let people know a before you were outed\nAnd the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black so after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found that he really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf it or not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nI said this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nAddition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves and try and\nDistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of ... out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he had four and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew ...\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWould sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and uh\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and so ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews that was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in Bergen dose and and that was the\nDefinitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a by by an been incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\nMoshe ... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek it also learned German because of his very divergent family history and the fact that the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learned because of\nBecause of these incredibly diversion family histories\nCan you explain to me how it's possible to believe and
