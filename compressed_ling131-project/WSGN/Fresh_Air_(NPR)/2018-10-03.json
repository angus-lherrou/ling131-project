guest journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce an agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair\nShort answer is is the risk that you failed to imagine it's while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what am I asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the ... now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of like a fire under me is when I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course of that every been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to do receive these briefings or and nobody showed up nobody to bring in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprise it's managing all these risks that eat imagines that we as a society to spend much time thinking about\nUm it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big portfolio of risk like the federal government runs and ... would you what happens is you\nYou amplify the wrists you increase the probability of of these risk actually causing problems\nIs fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project and all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it\nSidey of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a trip we had a prize the biggest ... ... ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of abuse and score and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nAnd is is having at it and nobody's paying much ... nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect to the fifth risk is the ... a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow\nWay but they require a long term approach and\nOn top of this enterprise has been has been for us this very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed weren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the sense that we ask the comments by includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah\nFirst of all what did you find in the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and it's unclear do National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was services the biggest part of no ... and how do they get there\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department as an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department a and it does it eats most of the resources\nAnd it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them an image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nThe uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free to companies like accuweather so they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is organized essentially a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer should use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option learn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from ...

I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk\nThat he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back this is uh\nThat's at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why would if you're curious about the national crisis well because\nThe dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for over a risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like ... predict\nWhat might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ...\nWhen they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it ah I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should've seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the this risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air [noise]\nToday China I mean the power in the walls and China we win with them or article\nChina have plans to build a brand new city from scratch on my walk of life for the district and politics and in a way\nNot deal if you actually see from coal fired stash falling off before\nThe next MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nThat's tomorrow morning from five to nine right here on Ninety point three WB H him\n[noise]\nAnd the boy comes from our members thank you and Birmingham children's theater presenting and in this corner caches clay Saturday and Sunday [noise] tickets and information at B.

government as a often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything supposed down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and\nI'm so lazy stupid people is it has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy change through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department of Commerce Department\nAnd I turned to having exactly the same experience the political people have when they're appointed these jobs running these places and have these some preconception with vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like\nUm this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have cut up contempt veg contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be brief can be you know it'd be kind of informed by these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes is is a mission driven person they're not paid well\nUh they're they're because they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids that people in the department of energy scientists about a passion for that particular science since they were little kids\n... essentially it's essentially what they are all these people are firefighters are in spirit and\nThere's something really moving about groups of people who were doing what they're doing not for money but from mission uh they they have a purpose in life and it just jumped off the page I mean it jumped is jumped into my mind to dealing with them and so I came away from it thinking [noise]\nSo these kinds of people

and Catherine my [laughter] and kept on in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair\nA kind of um you know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was
