shortly before his death called you want a darker\nAnd him as a singer and songwriter who's album like a man when gold in Canada and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal in Nineteen Seventy two Adam is going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\nLeonard Cohen lyrics have adept few songwriters have achieved reflecting reverence and despair and the traction to beauty and his knowledge of broken the lyrics informed by his Judaism his practice of Zen Buddhism and has dealt with\nSome of his many well known songs include Suzanne so long Marianne famously raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power of song I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and perform\nOh there's music I left his writing and I feel privileged and I've had the chance to hear them in concert anti attacking him on or shall I Know grateful for the chance to chat with you today and thank you for being here when I interviewed a father and she's having sex after the publication of a book of his homes and sons\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the flame I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our teeth ethnic interview\nI used to be your favorite drunk good for one more laugh then we both ran out of luck luck was all we had\nYou put on a uniform to fight the civil war I tried to join but no one like the side I'm fighting for so let's drink too when it's over and let's bring\nTo when we meet all be waiting on this corner where they're used to be a street it wasn't all that easy when you up and walk away\n\nBut all the way that little story for another rainy day I Know your burdens happy as you we'll it through the night the guru says it's empty but that doesn't mean it's light\nSo that strength to when it's over unless strength to when we meet all be standing on this corner where they used to be a street\nYou left me with the dishes and a baby in the bath\nAnd you're tied with the militias I knew where their their camera flash with I guess that makes us equal but I Want to march with you or just an extra in the sequel to the old red white and blue\nSo let's bring to when it's over unless drank too when we meet all be waiting on this corner where they used to be a street\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspelled tracks during the subjects because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate him things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and Adam Cohen wrote the introduction to it when they take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air [noise] mid term elections are coming up\nIt's all things considered fuses on it and then we help you

point three W. B. H M public radio for the heart of Alabama\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nI'm Wondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which you talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nAppreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work\nIt's so they haven't met the have his work has a life outside of his mouth and ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems\nSo I go and then when you get on record as say oh I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men\nOr that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book in absorbing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that your father I'm going to say I'm not being kicked kicked cantankerous or in transit you\nKnow it's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing\nBut I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his from the interview that we recorded in two thousand six\nAnd this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely carrier June\nFor many years I was known as a month I shaved my head in war robes and got up very early I hated everyone but I acted generously and no one found me out\nMy reputation as a ladies' man was a joke it caused me to laugh bitterly\nThe story window above the park

the intellect nor the silent voice with you that's also castles\nAnd now gentle reader in what name in whose name do you come to Idaho with me in these luxurious and twin ... realms of aimless privacy\nI think that home Adam gets you a little but we were talking about the connection of your father writing in solitude and the reader ... reading alone and as entering his [laughter] yeah entering his solitude yeah\nAs you noted also a kind of a of humor you know half of the river a loved one who's lines where he says a few so good not to love you like I did it's like the tour away my blindfolded and said we're going to let this prisoner live [laughter] that does hilarious\nMy guest is Adam Cohen he's written a forward to a new collection of previously unpublished writings and

Suzanne selling Marion here that's nowhere to say goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire\nWhen you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing at ... um but but you are you at your father was a song writer scene must have had an awareness that sign writing was a craft that something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them and you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I I I was a five year old or on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking at it into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see how remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scrapped it and I asked my father for council is a dead you know maybe maybe I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and I\nWas expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped\nContinue refining but instead he turned to me and said and you scrap your record that's an amateur move sit amateur move he says yeah it's not about\nHow you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton\nThat he had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise]\nWere you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember so how much did you get\nTo see a father after that\nTwo people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father\nWas able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives you'd always he always maintained a\nRole um in in our life despite my parents' separation so a caravan has like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nOkay yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived\nIn his along dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh\nYou know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of and\nHow long should I Do that for\nWhat he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for\nUm he's reconnection to people um I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing saw to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[laughter]\nHilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with a song and poetry um in incredible that [laughter]\nThat with the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected in\nFestive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works uh studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden in

life during treatment more at Cancer Center dot com\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict in social media was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nAre interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way you hide both sides using\nThe exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where uh they were enlisting\nThe online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who's\nIn a baseball ticket that then you got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of law is it something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's a narrative\nBe buried underneath this you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we can ...\nSo for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian actors go on to what ... very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook that was a sexual term\nAnd during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is ...\nTask of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um and that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nWonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war\nA certain way to challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to AI battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo some of these neural networks ... could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane\nStations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave\nOr there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an examples Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich oh by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and meld together to allow you to a innocence create a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's going to be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
