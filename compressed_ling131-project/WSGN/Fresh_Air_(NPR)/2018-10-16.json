Kim Fields and be like\nOh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman you write about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight do than for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so\nHow have you tried to overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place than you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that soft outcome and so I think\nWhat I have done is I have\nChosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in a house\nI make it is not about a number\nIf you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans\nI feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ... I Know that but there there'll be like oh yeah we have a size four and it's like that is unacceptable to me\nTo only have a size four is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people\nI'm a ten twelve\nJust what it is and there'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you truly it's like how\nYeah I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need to have\nThis sort of oh well we only have a zero to four so you either ... or you're you're screwed is not how you should treat anybody I Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into and every time I didn't fit in something I'd be like I'm Sorry\nAnd the Apollo time I would apologize after every single ...

person who you're with no what have you learned about yourself from the periods where you you were single and lived alone\n[noise] um before I met British bake off that's what we call him a before I met him I really just was I really love romantic comedies and I I really was like\nWanted to have that moment in my life where I'm like dating this guy and then he just as like gives his\nVerbal approval or whatever about me and is like your your amazing and then that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we will have this happy life together\nAnd so that was like one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort of define me\nOr make me realize that I'm lovable\nI just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK if I don't date someone

by herself\nAnd nobody they're all like focused on their ... they are not thinking about you you know and it was just was so sort of like self absorbed from Mike everyone's judge me for being single

also a lights\nHe turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nTo

just a boy in ...\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from th elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to later exhibits\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science is the great equalizer watch says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington

she spoke with fresh air producer Sam brother ... welcome to fresh air [noise] Hi I'm really pleased to be here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm not a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers or you know everywhere expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe are the conditions in circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash\nAnd he's a field worker on the plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by touch there's a lot of nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes wash his life forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man to catch 'em and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in this and this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever Hans wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as being helpful to his experiment\nThat's a which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him with his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man it's just completely [noise] you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under touch\nBought some you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a ... character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his a philosophy or adult life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so\nThere's that dichotomy in his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how for your the people complicit in ... the slave economy\nYeah exactly I think that son teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in light ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and [noise]\nAnd he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite\nIt's this is being funded by slavery and he's kind of turned a blind eye to that and so he's profoundly affected by it because he wouldn't be able to do what he does a without that a dark commerce going on [noise]\nEvery other
