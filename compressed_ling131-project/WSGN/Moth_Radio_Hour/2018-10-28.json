I saw this because you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was in a casino and uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was concerned about my own\nGambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning at the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nSince I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me as adults a

thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to count cards for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of friends and mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it a new stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your

three or more first names [laughter] presents a piece of ID to a person in a casino he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases

couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the ...\nEverything my mother did was interesting to me I I'm a door to her but mostly what I adore the vouchers that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry in speaking in this language which I had no

that's not what the law says you're really doing is telling a story\nTo understand something more deeply [noise]\nThis story that you're about to hear increase in the ... war and it's not the perfect man told and mosques night called high rent stories from the front lines here\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one\nI grew up in a wealthy suburb I spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand dollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war is are able to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not this point\nBut it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people die and wars are civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war it was the girls that sucks\nIn um taken by served paramilitary forces are and ... they took her up to a field above a town called ... and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summer it was hot and the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails\nAnd that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to die to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop\nAnd we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the bullet comes\nOut of you know one point a guy ... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen\nMinutes well all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was a turning inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going more wars I felt like there was something\nI needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking\nCombat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd it's\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan a postcard\nRestrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them\nSandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you\nSo much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at it gives the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt what's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what's the mass on\nThat angle you don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking ended everything I was paralyzed by some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap and he grabs Sufi throws my camera to\nMe it throws my bullet proof Bessie grabs his stuff is throwing a mode of soldiers 'cause the soldiers are\nPinned down to and it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I started shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared any more Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nDid you ... where young men are free to love each other on reserve Italy without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rich in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my feelings on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of heal up So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that same broke his leg he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well is broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by daughter were going to get\nHammered here's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down off the mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment and um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well it started it started with this scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came\nUm scene where I'm riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\n\nHe went off under the engine block do instead of under us", "year":
