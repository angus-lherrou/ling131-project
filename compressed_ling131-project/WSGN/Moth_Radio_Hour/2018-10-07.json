new in the details ... each day most of them are in consequential but sometimes our eyes wide and we'd be early on on the detail that changes everything\nHappened to our first story teller our our Thomas when he pulled focused on a small sign in a library Eric originally\nTold this story for his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland [noise] here he is alive and [noise]\nThe first time I went viral was in two thousand and two um do you know what that means going viral yeah it's that thing where everyone's path through on the same name or the same article ah we're all talking to each other on the Internet at the same time\nAnd that happened to me in two thousand and two not two thousand two as you remember what the wild west days of the Internet or there was no Twitter there was no YouTube very few people were on Facebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then uh and I say that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nSo and do you have to do I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um it was a really hard time in my life I was sad\nAll the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join in the activities I just occasionally were right um movie reviews for the college newspaper and I did that mostly\nAnd and for work I worked at the local the Baltimore Sun the local paper um in their subscription complaints department\nI'm living [noise]\nAnd so we would call me if they didn't get their paper delivered in the morning I'm sometimes he would call me if they had a complaint about a an editorial I couldn't really do much about that and sometimes people just call me because they were lonely and so I Would go in and five and talk on the phone until noon and then I Would go to campus\nUm and then I Would go back home and that was my life\nSo I went viral in February um I was in the campus bookstore one afternoon I'm In February courses black history month and so they had a

PR acts I'm Jennifer Hicks in our next story if I have special ed teacher we first met any Han ...\nNot far from her home in Chinatown here than any live at the [noise]\nBought in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of gotten negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down learn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\n[noise] and\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents\nAnd if the U.S versus China and I asked my dad who are re rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought\nI couldn't ask that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause ...\nBut I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was so excited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nPeople that\nSeen three people who ever looked at like\nMe Jackie Chan treaty that yellow power ranger [noise]\nA cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch the last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding ... signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen\nClick on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who was being said that\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral instead the next week\nThe two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine next people are now saying if this happens to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us\nAnd so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before and Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching this documentary\nAnd I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says that's your family\nWhat\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related to ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him\nNo I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face\nAnd there's just pain and\nAnguish in her eyes she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions\nI ask about a murder man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her so I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid\nLook at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother little each in ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured\nAt her house in the suburbs of the choice feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes China set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nSome moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because the woman looks so much\nAnd sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family or someone who spoke up\nTo be a ... again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit\nAnd I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to see even sanctions grave\nWe she drives us and we find Vincent ... name on a tombstone lowly chains name on the tombstone and little each and husband's name on a tombstone\nThey're no longer goals they are right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why this means so much to me\nI go the next states in my relatives house we're eating swells dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad\nOh says can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's\nLine my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on this list is Long Beach and so now I Know the legion is my grandmother's sister lowly chin is my mother's first aunts and Vincent Chin is my mother's first cousin\nSo I asked my eighth grade ... who\nWhat happens to lowly after Vincent Chin died she tells me well when Vince inside lowly was all alone in Detroit\nSo your grandmother and I ... sisters flew to America from China to support her your mom and dad had married in China so your dad came soon after they all found work in New York and that's how your family ended up in Manhattan's Chinatown\nI thought about this for a while\nMy name is Elaine ...
