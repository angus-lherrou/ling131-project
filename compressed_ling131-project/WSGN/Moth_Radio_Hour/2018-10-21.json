people and situations you might not come across your daily life\nIn this hour we'll hear something that might sound familiar and close to home\nA wedding a divorce and others that might sound less typical a trans man who wants to get pregnant or a Muslim at a barbecue joints called hog wild that scene takes place in our first story it's from Omar ... he's currently a law student at Stanford for moonlight as a comic\nOr is he a comic who won lights as a law student he\nSeems equally devoted to both\nHe told the story in Anchorage, Alaska where we partner with a local story telling the Arctic entries here's Omar ...\nI'm a Pakistani Muslim and or in two thousand three I moved to rural Missouri [noise]\nNot great timing [noise]\nRemember when I first moved to Missouri I was in my first class my teachers would roll call and she was like a Omar query rushing marquee Russian I was like yo lady coolest I'm new here\nAnd there was a kid in front of a class his name was breath I turn around and looked me said she just say Osama bin Laden\nWas like no she didn't say Osama bin Laden was like All right very ...\nDo you think oh boy [laughter] or they say\nAre you an al ...\nI was like no I'm not not ... because like All right thank God we can be friends that [noise]\nBut you just kind of an idiot that's all it took [noise]\nI can go to the essay like that [noise]\nSo you start to Missouri was a very very difficult but not everyone is bad actually made a best friend the first day his name is Brenda Brenda was great he had moved to my town from buffalo Missouri and he moved there because his dad was a preacher and he was going to take over the local church\nAnd Britain was gray you would later become the captain of all the sports teams at high school and he loved the town he said Omar you're going to love it here everyone is so nice and friendly like for example I just thought my hair cut at this guy named Troy and Troy is the best okay he talked to me about sports about church you got to go see\nSo then that day when my dad picked me up I was like dad\nLet's go to choice for haircut so we went to Troy and Troy is\nIs a mobile home with\nWith like a barber chair in there and so we walk in and there's a Confederate flag hanging up and my dad like yeah I think you'd better leave [laughter] and I was like no down we're going to stay Troy is the best [noise]\n... like we're not taking any new clientele and you better get home before it gets dark and I was like this business model is flawed\nNo one in here [noise]\nAnd my dad like work out how we got back in the car and on the way home my dad didn't say anything\nAbout it and didn't need to we still haven't said anything about it to this day because he must have realized that he had taken us to a place where we didn't even feel safe getting her hair cut and it must have been especially taxing for him because he's a strong pocket funny man he cared about family more than everything\nAnd it weighed heavily on him but over time we really started to feel like we were a part of Missouri people there are super friendly and kind even though they're pretty racist [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to the mall radio hour on Ninety point three WBAI gym\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is a moth radio hour from the Iraq I'm Jennifer Hicks in our next story was told in Sioux Falls where we partner with South Dakota public broadcasting\nThe theme with big night at the theater and our next story teller shared a story about her big night fears carry Adam live in South Dakota [noise]\nSo when I got married\nI became obsessed with the details of the wedding\nI thought it was an opportunity to show everybody who we were as a couple and not that we were just perfect for each other but that we had perfect case to side dived into research I was looking up cakes and photo booth backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason ... was invented [noise]\nAnd after all of my deep dives that was ready to go I started the invitations\nI hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation\nAnd I'm nailed them in on the lips with vintage stamps I had picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad\nGot a salute to the military stamp than I had just scour ... for a vintage WC Fields for a funny friend or I may have some Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but\nAfter those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache so I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my wedding bouquet like created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's a wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the ... vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little ... for the twelfth cakes we were going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nThere were things he cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed didn't orchestrated it and send it off to the bans and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise]\nThat's what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which was my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years when the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung olive the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made\nFailed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season\n[noise]\nI was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shapes of swans when the tornado siren\nWent off and then came the rain and then hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the tables over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night\nAnd they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nNo luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter] that's the only time that's lucky by the way\nWe had invited all of these ... people\nSo we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so up with the big top and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm are ready to begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get in the little card I made so we just proceed without her\n[noise] um [noise] I was looking forward to the song you know I hadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack\n[noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nMy favorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um\nSo throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me was that my dad\nDecided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there and I have a stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and\nI didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called them and he said well I sent a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nAnd and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter danced by myself\n\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we swayed beneath the big top\nHe looked at me and said your dad should have been here and he should have been and then maybe\nHe would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburgers fighters just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm it finally passed\nI mean a star friends singing a song from ... to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\n\nAnd\nSo after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and the specialty cocktail I have made [laughter] which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nIn fact it was our friends and the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day and they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that\nWe shouldn't have gotten married there's some things even take can't fix maybe\nIf I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increase corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did he missed a part of my life and he also missed our friend I'm a meat\nLoaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends danced in the pedals\nSo we missed a lot\nYou would think that with all\nI Love the details and stuff and I just became a wedding planner [laughter]\nI've married about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them they've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days I've added more and more pins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head and so if I ever get married again\nWe're totally going to a low [noise]\n\nCarry at him [noise] in addition to being a wedding planner Kerry also runs an online store called the plumb fields shop\nHer dream to be a magicians assistant I'm just putting that out there for you carry all it takes is one big breaking to see some pictures from Kerry sweating all the empty details visit the moth dot org I keep meaning to ask\nCarrie if she includes karaoke led by pot roast as part of her standard wedding package that would be a big seller I think\n[noise]\nMm [noise] Mm [noise] Mm [noise]\nThe malls radio hour is produced by landed in public media in Woods Hole Massachusetts and presented by the public radio exchange pure

radio our frumpy Iraq's I'm Jennifer ... next up our final story it's another from our show in Albuquerque with our partners K n Debbie here's Tristan reef live in New Mexico\nIt's a bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trailer with my partner Beth he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nAnd he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had no I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley and Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby\nOr this isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender\nAh for me that means that I was born female\nI'm I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling the feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um\nI could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did um [noise]\n\nI I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nUh and it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nKnow what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby a and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible\nIn the world as a pregnant man I'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns a and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer [noise]\nUm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nAh [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know I Love everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse and he's a pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it\nAnd there were two lines and it was like ... and it was going to be a baby you know but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things that get ready for baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHaley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly I'm\nAn all of those ah markers of femininity in everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like they have sort of my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nAhead and made around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes there is hardship and and being transgender a specially for trance\nSo the joy and love and and Brazilians and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um CNN a Washington\nPost people magazine pregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I just a really ugly\nHarry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster and then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby\nBecause that maybe would be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you I was six months pregnant when I read that message now I have been trans for a long time Fifteen Years\nI'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today um I think that I'm resilient and ...\nHope for our country and and for trans people that we would ever be loved in the way we deserve and all of those stories started to seep in one night I had a really horrible nightmare where I was giving birth not not to a baby but to a monster", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "21"}
