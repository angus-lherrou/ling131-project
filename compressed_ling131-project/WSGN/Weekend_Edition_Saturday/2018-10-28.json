streets predominantly Jewish but there are a lot of different synagogues or the tree of life where this massacre happened at three different congregations that met there\nAnd it's fun everyone assumes that they're going to be knowing someone who was directly affected by this\nRight what are they saying about what happened\nI mean there are a lot of views and everyone I think it's still pretty numb and shocked but somehow in a way not surprised that I'd Jews have a historical context for this that I got from a rabbi David Friedman from neighboring congregation\nFor plague of anti Semitism goes back a four thousand years so uh we would have hoped that would come to an end finally but unfortunately still with us\nFrom Seventy years after the Holocaust or the world was a very little\nAnd there

inside and have sort of direct first hand knowledge of this ah they're waiting I'm just like we are to find out who was inside now\nUh we understand that there were no children killed inside or some of the wounded include included a a police officers and a and to a seniors\nBut when these names come out and people are going to find out and and even if there were no children everyone there was someone's child and there were someone's mother or father siblings and friends in the community is expecting to be to be hit very hard when when these names are released and then the funerals will

me says Carrie Kahn NPR News San Pedro Sula Honduras\nWell now going to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her she says she sees a direct line between a politician's words\nAnd bombs in the mail we want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidents\nAct certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters\nActually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election now we came back from that precipice turning the presidential campaign but now here we're at that precipice\nAgain and it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans in was enraged about the geo piece position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it\nWas a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act so we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\nI mean I Want to turn to you now I'm the care about of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know\nUm you have actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration\nSo you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect on how\nAnd in one recent study with Renee floors he's a sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality\nAnd of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorbed this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized that we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chambers whoever consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that uh liberals versus conservatives held and yet\nThis criminality stereotyped as it seems to have of overwhelmed people's kind of political divide 'em and has invaded invaded our mind\nSeven forty happy Sunday\nI'm we're around with these headlines a forty six year old man is in custody facing twenty nine charges after a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday eleven people were killed and six others were wounded including for police officers the suspect reportedly had no criminal record but had posted anti Semitic posts on line\nPresident Trump has ordered flags that federal buildings throughout the country

that's according to a new poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nNow one county in western Washington is taking a unique approach to tackle the problem and a boy ... why rock of finding fixes podcast reports how that works back\nWhen ... was the police chief of stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in their community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible standard than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population does not in\nRural America for decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jail and saw that is\nVery very sick very very sick people because detox from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people around out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [laughter] the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster in the county\nDeadliest landslides in American history forty three people died Sherri ... is the sheriff's director of communications she took

coordination with each other all the same objective which is like sixty\nCoordination life safety what if they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nCounty leaders took the idea and ran with it now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representative from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump the technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group it comes straight out of FEMA's emergency response flavor six\nTerm is completed they talk to your PowerPoint slides\nI think family fires kind of\nThe numbers refer to items on there to do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nThis to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades I or ten is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo she set an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in either in any of our lifetime [noise] um by breaking it down like he didn't an elephant you just can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers to help

dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected diamond Robert ...\nAnd since I live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning Hi Lou uh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told and none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a it as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifle we're told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us\nThere have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how\nHow does this fit into this awful pattern rate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism\nOn the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think a point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding [noise]\nYeah well I think mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened at a house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help Stanley's a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and the people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nIt depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy\nAs a normal part of American Life I'm as something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty what helped the tour such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years think of Texas that actively carry out death sentences but unless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this is a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to read reduced this kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it uh ... what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I I think\nThese situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is is there is a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce it\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community and in this case\nTo make an anti immigrant uh motives that tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and also we like to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in a are Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning It's MORNING\nSo I set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference now I'm willing to go there live here we go\nTo offer our most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's senseless acts of hatred and violence to the families and friends and to Pittsburgh Jewish community and to the larger community of Pittsburgh\nJewish community of Pittsburgh is one that we as Pittsburgh this treasure it's an important part of the cultural and social identity of Pittsburgh and so this was an attack upon our neighbors and upon our friends and one that we felt very deeply\nThe fact that this attack took place during a worship service makes it even more heinous a place of worship is a sacred place it's a place of peace in the place of grace it's a place where community comes together to celebrate that that they hold most dear and most sacred\nReiterate what everybody said so far which is weak\nIn my office extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families I met with them last night during the process of identification and there's no words to express a uh the the um the sympathy that they did it yesterday evening at the uh I'm\nA synagogue we've of a synagogue and ... all eleven victims ah before they were removed and brought from the synagogue last night to my office uh\nUh we've

saying that I've seen this room a lot of times on TV and I never thought I'd be at the podium um\nThis is an awful awful period for a Jewish community and uh and especially for the families who have been affected and it's real when once you hear the names were going to do everything we can to help the families how we're in the process of doing that now\nAnd will be there for them and be there to

communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we work together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal to the state to the county to the local was something that we should all be proud of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics we're at the scene\nOr medics deciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from surrounding counties the federal agents in this state troopers and the county\nOfficers all working together in order to be able to make sure an episode\nThat will forever go down in the history of this city is one of the worst moments that we have experienced\nWas able to be less and because of that coordination\nInto those that are standing behind me who spoke early earlier\nThe professionalism that was exemplified through their leadership\nOne officer who's been discharged the thanks for the entire city go to them\nThey're sacrificing their knowing of the danger that they put themselves in in order to be able to protect others there's something when they put on that uniformed that we should understand\nThe sacrifice that they make to their family members the city will be behind in there to support you in anything that you may need\nAnd finally to those that are not familiar with Pittsburgh to those who have given a their words of not only confidence that support shoot Pittsburgh from around the world around this nation in around the state\nThank you we know\nThat we as a society are better than this we know that hatred will never win out\nThat those that tried to divide us because of the way that we pray or where our families are from around the world will lose\nIn in Pittsburgh where pragmatic and we find solutions to problems we will not tried to rationalize the rational behavior we will not try to figure out ways in order to lessen the degree of crimes such as this we will work to eradicate it\nWe will work to eradicate it from our city\nFrom our nation in our world\nHatred will not have a place\nAnywhere in we won't work\nLocally to make those changes happen and we will work with partners around this country and around this world to make sure that it once\nWhen I think again all of those in this room the elected officials who are gathered those that have worked on the front line of public safety those that worked within public works in other parts of government in order to be able to assure the safety of our people\nAnd will open it up to questions at this time\nI was married built into a you're listening to special coverage from NPR News and that was a press conference

Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters ... but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that is\nWere feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color where you had legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how\nDid those two things than sit when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very glaring clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally what voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it\nIt's it's economic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair\n\n\nAre

scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of\nHow this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans in was enraged about the geo peas position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a ...\nOr to CARE Act so we've now seen three instances in which all elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over people ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later\nThe national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\nI ... I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know um you have actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions\nAre in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely\nYeah so in in one reason study with Renee floors he's a sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about\nThe many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving this stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is that people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized we would find\nAnd media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that are liberals versus conservatives held and yet this criminality stereotyped as it seems to have of overwhelmed people's kind of political divide 'em and has invaded invaded our mind\nIt's nine forty I'm nowhere around with these headlines\nRanged in age from fifty four to Ninety seven and included a married couple and two brothers a forty six year old man is in custody facing federal charges officials say the suspect had no criminal record but as posted anti Semitic posts on line\nPresident Trump has ordered flying said federal buildings throughout the country flown at half staff to show respect for the dead he condemned what he called an evil anti Semitic act\nAnd in baseball the Boston Red Sox beat the Los Angeles Dodgers nine to sex in the fourth game of the world series last night Boston leads the best of seven series three games to one I'm ...
