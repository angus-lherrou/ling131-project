Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about\nOr the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nClimbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those\nAre members of civil society\n[laughter] you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally to far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they look like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated Dutch\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange they need to invest in it they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided\nBy other allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now countries with which would liquidity\nHow do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses the ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very nicely blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been had and and this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version the Mexican government said that the army and if it at least they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends be seized official start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official there shouldn't be satellite is not to its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked these students and why they were attacked [noise] what\nI discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not these about why the west ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the ... not just is\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up well he's white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that [noise] so\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that two bosses where they were dressed spurt dating insight to the city\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to ... station\nThey do do that you both us and when the students were trying to escape ... be spy buses from the ... when the army the police\nThen when you see but police and the staple east it starts to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all ... of that back way to process\nIt from these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on those buses disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling in fi buff is quite that bad a good was just too\nI'm not so nice to versus what exactly they are two bosses that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems Steve ... before I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside in secret parts of the of the bus secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students and the the no ... for the army and if it that belief they knew it\nSo the students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers\nThey didn't know how do you know that heroin was hitting on that bus\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to conduct with one person that works for him and west these uh informant and inside the cartels that explain made this ... [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean there's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen\nAccording would my investigation that there's a responsible these crime wise that twenty seven battalion anyone\nIn particular the coat on their dad received a phone call from the law\nOr their ... you have to rescue my drugs I pay you for these you have I don't know I Know what you have to do I want my drugs back\nHave they faced any consequences what if they said to to your findings [noise] even now the Mexican government is an nagging you know they waste both peoples that day I mean they were press and the real person that we're in both\nSeven forty happy Sunday\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines President Trump says he will be talking soon was Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman speaking last night after a campaign rally in Nevada\nTrump said he needs to learn more about the killing of Saudi journalist ...

schedule\nGeneral trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave at what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just gonna maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole and if this\nGeneration will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that didn't as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how the Democratic tax increases have changed a lot of uh Connecticut residents away\nThat's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nIs something pivotal at stake here though um other than these little\nAnd the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representative for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday

of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz when after Hispanic nickname his rival over his long used\nLiberal thing they\nThe cruise himself hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nThe other way and just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for cleaning native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized we reached him earlier this week and ask him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why people are different from each other so that the idea that you\nFix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still methods in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get kids\nHealth care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talked about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly\nGasoline I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down the terrible road because once you've created\nAs a racial divisions it takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know we'll through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings in the very\nOf one of my identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order to go around the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a real noticed concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nYou know I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is\nYou know countries today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies so that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion and there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing losing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYes now the question is whether you can do that with our board your cold rightly weaponize identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise\nAnd turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind me thinking identity thank you very much thank you very much\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a

and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a state of loyalty at many issuing statements supporting a boat or Saudi Arabia and the acting and of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot a\nLot of fear a lot of worry that got people who are activists journalists dissidents\nAnd goes maybe sticking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those sent letters of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here\nThe leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated the terms of how they're released information really to extract that much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated Dutch\nUh they need they need hard currency they need foreign exchange than eating less meant they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by other allies or what we're allies and so\nIt doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was ... many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from the

disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is why they're good watch just to\nI'm not so nice to versus what exactly did to process that the army and they said that police start to monitor a\nScene Steve ... before I mean these two bosses would that do both is what the students were traveling from school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nOr a inside in secret parts of
