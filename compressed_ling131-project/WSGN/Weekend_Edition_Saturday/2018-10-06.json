vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it that is expected just a mentor conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we can both named conservative justices Souter Stevens black men Kennedy who he issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but ah this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations could\nYes we assume the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named Bush now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members are alumni of the federalist society who has been which has been a growing force in the court for years and swelling presence on the federal bench at lower levels and with the Trump Administration in ...\nYou need to know about the federalist society especially as they are going to be um more prominent than ever and us life or the group\nGot started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Google's legal scholars\nAre people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society have indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations asking\nThe question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscored there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get up to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished there could be\nBoth a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut Mitt terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms\nI'm now it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in in the surveys you mentioned unemployment is at a three point seven percent are

confirmed for the Supreme Court but the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post\nThanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bullshit forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] I'm wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then I had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this other not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the ...\nIt's her testimony she had had other witnesses who contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot ... let me ask you\nAbout the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian Bussey Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support for a judge\nNow the world hurt from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and as an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this ... neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... ah until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you\n[noise] [noise] I'm\nTrump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations just jumble Brian he's author of Trump nation they are\nHe was he's got is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily their head or of this one I I don't think that to news though I think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is\nThe extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald Trump ... over the years I've built what I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches I think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really late ... and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\n[noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower\nIn addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company it was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate\nHow much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their armada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think\nReally will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nTim O'Brien of Bloomberg opinion thanks so much think he's got\nThis week a report by Bloomberg said the Chinese government operative spotted microchips especially Mike Rowe microchips into service created by an American company called super
