step\nBut key members of Congress from both sides of the aisle questioned the Saudi account which is at odds with a Turkish explanation that says\nThere was a Saudi hit team with a bone saw and a plan to kill ... with us this morning as NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia for years ... thanks so much for being with us the money you have seen the Saudis statement\nWhat does it tell you about how the kingdom mishandling crushes\nWe see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal ... is dead the account places blame on senior advisors none of them\nOr to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary but the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership fail to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saudi defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mr ...\nIndeed so the Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for disposal\nTurkish authorities have been continuing this investigation and now it's in a forest near the you know the consulate so the official account doesn't explain

on Twitter Twitter is hugely popular in the kingdom and you have to read it to see what's going on internally\nA carton other question that has to be raised how could an operation on the scale take

the Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth to show gee we turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council on global affairs his new book\nRebecca thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that was promised to secretary of state or\nA pump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think\nOne of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation\nAh as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in ... in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies\nAre first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries\nOr at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the\nIndiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how uh\nAround elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues\nAnd one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments\nOf that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us read twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not\nHurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we named top two weeks is unacceptable even ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember Haitian mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that they were ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us like you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare\nAt the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects real change in the way a lot of wars conducted around the world\nThat's right but military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and uh\nGauging uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries I see no there's not many other names for them the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in eight and twenty fifty\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen to this llamas party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you use your guest in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\n[noise] I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal\nThat us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not ... a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're enjoying a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is against the law ... this is a buzzfeed story\nNot an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nIs this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend\nThere's other than the ones in rather Americans you'll leave you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons one is a there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we saw them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir argument is they're doing what the you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they they suggest you which patriotism yes his Arab ... investigative reporter for buzzfeed

Scott Simon we've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nAn aide who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day from it but she suffered from addiction singer was sixteen years old when production ... party\nA drug too cold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to think so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but\nWhat happened we've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many what made you sure all of this and you're a bridge or\nIt will do who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lift and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like math a donor buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son and her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate song she's just sitting in the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty\nThat we didn't know they've also shared stories about\nSupport and

makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what his focus\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about cabinet\nKevin off as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but

pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saudi\nUh in their custody he at the at the embassy and I stumbled the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWhile I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise]\nUm a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called ... death the unacceptable\nBut also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like bowling and General Dynamics and and as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said

officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable\nBut also right away scot pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and and as

ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that was promised to secretary of state or a pump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think\nOne of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nOr how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well\nOr to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries\nOr at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to\nAnd as moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president\nSeems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues\nAnd one would hope that a president the leader of the three world will be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments\nOf that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy\nAnd that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen coffee weeks is unacceptable uber gold or thank you thank you\nOf depressed 'cause we've got a new ad campaign to encourage
