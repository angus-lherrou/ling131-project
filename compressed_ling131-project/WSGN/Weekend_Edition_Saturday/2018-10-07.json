Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country\nLike a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart and that is really how it has felt at ...\nAn analogy I you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nUh and uh on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans who are on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] this close to an election it's it's hard to tell what is signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national\nSentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nA ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really

Garcia Navarro\nBrett Kavanaugh is now an associate justice of the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight is now over but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it ... it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time as senator\nTheir protest or stood up and yelled raw and visceral messages stir mansion [noise]\nCircles has been seen some of the cabinet confirmations a Senate taking on one of its most important and historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual assault\nBefore the vote majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded like they were in agreement road that\nLed us here has been bitter angry and partisan\nVote to confirm drug Scott ... is a vote to end those brave\nDark chapter in the center for\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged and agreed but for very different reasons Republicans saw character assassination old unproven allegations designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation Lindsey Graham's diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations some of the\nBest I Would never do to them what you've done this guy this is the most ethical sham since I've been in politics\nDemocrats like New York's Kirsten Gillibrand soft Ford's claim Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school at the combination of the year old me too movement a referendum on whether women or believe when they report harassment or assault\nWe allow women's experiences sexual trauma second to a man promotion it will not only diminish this watershed moment a societal change we are and it will bring shame on this body and on\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor Ford's sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked off a lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bells but while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage\nRepublican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing cabin on\nThe legislative branch we have an obligation a moral obligation\nSchumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election vote\nIf you believe Dr Ford and other brave women who came forward\nAnd you want to vindicate their sacrifice\nVote Republicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post the whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh for energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle\nThere's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu this\nHas been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up he'll suck it up they'll suck it up\nAnd they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court hears what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environments that we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nThe short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on\nSex covers gay and lesbian employees just as Kevin other places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote a when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment\nFor the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us so very much thank you\nNicole child was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because this story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us\nAs an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race I think it was\nSomething that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that the my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you are of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of\nSo to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know it shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges you faced because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents first\nOf all I wouldn't have occurred to me just say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white Americans I really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge\nAnd if I tell them they might not understand anyway because their weight\n[noise] so you started to think about this experience and eventually when you get older you decide to go in search of your birth family as an adult ... what what made you do that there are several\nSeven forty happy Sunday\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines President Trump is calling Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court a

from Istanbul now to sort through the story I'm good morning Hi Lulu\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know Jamal ... walked into the Saudi conflict Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to a pending marriage to his Turkish fiance a she waited for him outside holding his phone until well after the consulate closed a says he never came out\nA Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports the first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record button to advise you to president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate a aired on says he said that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far\nWe haven't seen any evidence to back up his claim that showed used did just a persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\nYeah what if the Saudis and saying\nThe Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that his Yogi did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon a the Saudi press agency quote official saying he left the consulate Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very ...\nLeave the consulate uh the consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of ... he said the consulate has multiple exits but why would the showgirl leave by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting a front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president air to one says he's convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in this stumble on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show the either inside or leaving the council\nAlright two questions and the first one is um why is this important what does this mean for Saudi relations with turkey and with other world powers\nWell it could be very important but a lot will depend on

S. where NPR's Jackie Northam reports Washington is pushing back\nUs is unquestionably the leader in advanced technology think artificial intelligence robotics sophisticated weapon me it's what's helped give the country and national security edge that something China has recognized in once and on\nHe's the Chinese figured out the technology is key to ... an hour and the source of technology is still the west for China so how do they get their hands on the western technology\nThree years ago Beijing unveiled it's made in China twenty twenty five strategy which calls for the country to become a world leader in advanced technologies including artificial intelligence AI\nAs part of that China is forming global partnerships pumping massive resources into tech firms at home in Europe and here in the U.S\nLet's say they're very systematic very long term in their approach and it's very well funded\nMichael Brown is with the Pentagon's defense innovation unit in Silicon valley he says they're serious concern in Washington that China is acquiring too much sensitive us technology and transferring it back home\nThey don't play by the same rules that we do so a cyber theft is on the table industrial espionage is on the table which can include recruiting key talent at networking events that are sponsored by the Chinese government working with us universities\nJust last week Bloomberg reported to us was investigating whether China allegedly infiltrated the Pentagon and major companies such as apple and Amazon by building spy chips into server mother boards and mother boards were manufactured in China that companies denied the allegations\nBut there are other ways China is making inroads to capture\nAmerican innovation [noise] there's a quiet leafy part a Silicon Valley called Sunnyvale and a lot of the tech giants have a presence here there's Amazon labs linked in Yahoo and coming up now to Google complex and I can actually see some of the workers\nCity a picnic tables and enjoying the fine weather just behind the Google complex is a Chinese company called ... and it's Google's arrival by do is China's largest Internet search provider at openness innovation center here in Silicon valley\nWith a focus on self driving vehicles and other Chinese tech powerhouses Ali Baba ten cent walk away\nAlso have their own research and development centers here instead of buying an existing us business the Chinese tech giants come in and build a new company from the ground up\nThese moves are called Greenfield investments and they hire away a lot of us workers says the CSI us is Louis\n... you'll get a lot of talent this is a way to acquire new oil\nThere's also been a surge of investments in tech startups to Chinese venture capital Adam ... a senior analyst at ... group an economic research firm says there were more than Thirteen hundred rounds of funding for us start ups with at least one Chinese investor over the past eight years\nIs very common for Chinese firms to have some sort of ties to the government that might just be because they have to answer to the government of party leaders back at home and the first state some level of control\nThey shouldn't go says this has become a concern and national security circles because the nature of emerging technology is inherently you'll use in other words the AI algorithms used to help speed up your smart phones could also be applied to weapons on the battlefield\n... says while he's not aware of any smoking gun case where a Chinese venture capital has plundered sensitive technology from the start up it's widely acknowledge at a risk exists that\nVenture capital and other minority investments provide Chinese investors access potentially sensitive technologies particularly ones that are in a sense an early stage where us governments haven't had a full chance to evaluate the implications of those technologies\nBut for many American tech startups Chinese investment can be critical\nI think we got lucky and got a beautiful shreds it used to be an architectural consulting for\nChris Nicholson is the c._e._o. of sky mind which makes cutting edge artificial intelligence software daylight pours through the large windows overlooking San Francisco's mission street\nMission between Ninety ten is a little rough which is not very when you're trying to preserve\nNicholson helped create sky mind about four years ago he says the company like many startups was very fragile in the beginning until it got its first investment of two hundred thousand dollars from Chinese consumer tech giant ten cent\nAnd nobody else fold that allowed us to survive and it's just like the whole trick who sort of says just by yourself enough time until you can realize your views and posted on the\nSky mind now has funding from some major American venture capitalists and a few smaller Chinese ones Nicholson disputes that venture capital investors automatically gain access to start ups research or know how [noise]\nLater stage investors putting in much larger amounts typically ask for things like for me\nFor confidential technical information\nRight now we're bored to people that it's me and microphones Americans\nFor decades funding for firms like Nicholson's was through the defense department it helped create technological breakthroughs that led to things like semi conductors in miniaturized GPS\nBut that funding over the years has become slow and cumbersome well technology has been moving much faster in the private sector [noise] the Pentagon recognize the problem and in twenty Fifteen set up the D I view the defense innovation unit\n[laughter] [noise]\nMilitary engineer maneuvers a tiny drone at the buses above a tarmac at the G I use in Silicon valley lieutenant colonel David Ross side says the Pentagon created\nThe unit and so we make it easier to get funding to start ups\nOr trying to grow the defense industry bays by in placing these companies that traditionally wouldn't work with us don't honestly need to work with us but have a great capability that we would all benefit from\nThis ultimate funding is one way Washington is trying to counter Chinese investment\nThe Trump Administration has also been aggressive in blocking several large mergers and acquisitions of us tech companies by Chinese firms\nAnd Congress is beefing up laws on the books end up protecting us technology from foreign governments it will allow closer scrutiny of all sorts of Chinese inroads in the tech sector says Mario ... a trade lawyer was Kirkland analysis\nI think some deals where there are Chinese investors will be a lot harder more deals will get a lot more scrutiny and some deals just\nAre not going to happen many us tech companies push back against tougher laws on foreign investment warning it could strangle innovation sky minds Nicholson again\nIn Washington DC people say innovation is an American that they think that people can go anywhere else British that's not

more about that elsewhere in the show but let's begin this hour with multiple she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent he Molly Hi\nUh so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrats as sort of a weapon ... me too movement for political gain\nAnd on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now Kavanaugh sitting Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country\nLike a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to be an analogy\nI you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already a quite exercised particularly ... particularly women uh\nAnd uh on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans who are on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said it big\nAlong with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's\nBack now and the Republicans do I think I have no idea frankly [laughter] disclosed to an election it's it's hard to tell what signal and what is noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national\nSentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nA ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to regain the upper hand and and do well in his life\nYeah that's the thing though right because um this is a great week for the president um but his poll numbers are still low\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from universal pictures presenting the new film first men

from NPR News I'm new to Garcia Navarro Brett Kavanaugh is now an associate justice of the Supreme Court like having a confirmation fight is however that as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time as senator stood\nAt their desks informally voted on cabin on vice president Mike Pence presided\nProtester after protesters stood up and yelled raw and visceral messages stir mentioned [noise]\nCircles has been seen some of the cabinet confirmations a Senate taking on one of its most important in historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual assault\nBefore the vote majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded like they were in agreement road\nThat led us here has been bitter angry and partisan\nVote to confirm drug Scott ... is a vote to end this brave\nDark chapter in the Senate history\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged and agreed but for very\nWell ... designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation Lindsey Graham's diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations sum this up\nBest I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most ethical sham since I've been in politics\nDemocrats like New York's Kirsten Gillibrand soft Ford's claim Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school at the combination of the year old me too movement a referendum on whether women are believe when they report harassment or assault\nWe allow women's experiences sexual trauma second to a man promotion it will not only diminish this watershed moment a societal change we are and it will bring shame and this body\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor forwards sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bells but while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage\nRepublican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh\nAs a legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation a moral obligation to do better than this\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford\nAn ogre brave women who came forward\nAnd you want to vindicate their sacrifice vote\nRepublicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post the whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh for energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle\nThere's about a month left to election day the big question now is which parties voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nWe're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice\nFor a fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up\nAnd they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do with the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work and let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court hears what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for example future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin other places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote a when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like I'm closely contested cases\nSeventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences\nWay beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power\nOr not NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thinking you know so very much thank you\nNicole ... who\nWas born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her\nParents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it was attributed to God or to faith you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be\nBecause this story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity\nGrowing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race I think it was something that my family\nDidn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know it shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what is it challenges you faced because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents first of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to\nSay this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white Americans I really remember feeling\nI tell them they might not understand anyway because their weight\n[noise] so you started to think about this experience and eventually when you get older you decide to go in search of your birth family as an adult ... what what made you do that there are several\nIt's nine forty on trial Snyder with these
