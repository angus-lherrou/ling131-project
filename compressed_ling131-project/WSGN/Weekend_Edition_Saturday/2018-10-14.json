Navarro the midterms are less than a month away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control\nTwenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down he Jessica Hi Lulu so Ken Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors they have a\nReally good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what states\nAre you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSo there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple estates\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and ... it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nPricing and notable for Republicans is how many of their income and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants in their jails for the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cats with member station WNYC reports\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned it into a political firestorm\nTo the issue was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement\nAgency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nBecause you'd night because you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get this thing down here in an alley we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five tense hours Hudson County voted to end the ice contract but not until twenty twenty that way the county would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nYou all democratic ... as the county legislators in New Jersey or known assured residents that action would be taken years Anthony Romano\nIs a strong possibility we will be phased out of this\nAcross the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice in Williamson county\nHave ordered stop accepting ice detainees but all of this is not happening without push back\nYour job is rather than it is a town\nYou've on balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences Ryan ... represents immigrants at the jail pro bono\nFamilies and lawyers and their community are here and the separation from those resources is critical to enabling detainees actually win their cases it remains permanently and the United states or have released on\nBond versus the detainees should be allowed to stay in New Jersey near their families and lawyers unlike in other parts of the country immigrants jailed in Hudson County or eligible for free legal representation\nThe free holders did agree to try to improve conditions for immigrants before the end of the contract the gel has been plagued by problems suicides poor medical care that food several former detainees testified at the hearing last week\nWith the

...\nElectrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground\nNow across the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott parents and at the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that are willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when

and an overhead ally\n... says in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure\nShe says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient one thing McNamara would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nSo we also need to be fishing restraint Cheney's of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population it keep the lights on even if the project powering down\nMcNamara was lead author of a twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change\nThat's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries\nDeadline for next month's election closed in Florida we know Florida has a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season mark a poodle covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nThanks for having me All right so first off you grew up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or a month just over a year ago you've seen a lot of storms come through what are you thinking about Michael in the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast and I remember the city of wave wind in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now they're just homes wiped\nClean from their slabs and then all of the associated\nDestructive miss that kind of turns a once can flush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of a Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likeliest scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRich got was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over well both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nIt was right and in this case it appears so far that Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee\nThere but it was hit pretty hard it was hit yeah a Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the\nThe county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss and coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the Centers for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn in one case actually changed showing trees away [laughter]\nAnd I'm moving debris really show he's changed trees [laughter] he's making\nSure Gillum is that he was not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone is trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen ah what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire pan handle it can be almost impossible ... right now because you can't get a hold of a half you know eating in a sense of the people\nThat political market Bhutto joining us from Florida this

Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nHaven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton\nDo you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really you have a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think a really close race still\nNext door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there were always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've ever really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nAdmit that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you [noise]\nIce has been a rallying cry for some on the left the coal gain traction due to President Trump's

immigration crackdown\nBecause you'd night because you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get this thing down here in ... county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five tense hours Hudson County voted to end the eyes contract but not until twenty twenty that way the county would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nYou all democratic board of ... as the county legislators in New Jersey or known assured residents that action would be taken years Anthony
