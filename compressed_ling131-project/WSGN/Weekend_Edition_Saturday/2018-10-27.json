the last three years to other crown princes have been pushed aside in part to make room for him there's a third option or that his powers a weekend that the king of points\nOthers in the royal family

about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem street and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us\nOther football players took her new you're not during the plane or the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this\nWas an issue that reached the top of\nThe food chain what did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation ...\nSo it it it wasn't director to achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most\nTo this debate I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in

pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political at these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority\nThis campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nAnd there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\n[noise] what are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so much of the season aren't you [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support\nThe tendency to swing voters and you can't be too vitriolic and those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boating college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and Tamara weekend edition Sunday literally looks at our

ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker ... we got a dealer dealers [laughter] if I was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save the Dodgers season ...\nWalker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance in their grave reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a

us great to be with you Scott and let's begin to the crown prince is it possible he would lose power over the cause of Jews fare\nWell there are four different options one is that he stays in power that the international furor eventually settled down and uh he managed to kind of orchestrate his ability to stay on the throne um he is a de facto leader in Saudi Arabia because his father is age to nailing\nThe second scenario is that he is replaces crown prince and there is precedent for that are over the last three years to other crown princes have been pushed aside in part to make room for

question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile and there had to be a lot of behind the scene maneuvering including a request

weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon\nLast week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described effort by the Russian backed\nInternet research agency to use Twitter bucked the influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew beaten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem extra beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this is a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald\nIt's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that reached the top of\nThe food chain what did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency\nWell what we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nMm So it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed correct\nYes so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with\nBetty White you know as a gift for twentieth anniversary is drier Lynch and we have a whole lot of it on our way to Peter Segal and his group because of the show that follows us in many markets\nAnd I don't mean Kroger are safe way wait wait don't tell me is celebrating his twentieth anniversary with a special episode will even include a few laughs\nPeter Sagal joins us now from the studios of Chicago public radio Peter thanks very much for Twenty years of sober thoughtful\nNews ... exactly we knew that people just didn't take NPR seriously enough with all your frivolously\nAnd high jinx so we decided that we needed to finally try to require a reputation for sober consideration at this network and I'm Glad to have done it thanks so much I'm\nSerious question yes um they're serious chilling events a school shooting range church bombings in this week although thankfully no one's harm bomb threats\nSo much harder than others to have fun with the news Oh yes but we know that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly\nYou've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of the United states uh two two presidents of the yeah we had the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to me since [laughter]\nAnd the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared host presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it but they might also have those opinions\nMr Carl Kasell we all you've had some great partners I have and I've been blessed and I have stood on the shoulders are next to do the shoulders of giants as everyone knows a not only was Carl Kasell original judge and scorekeeper he was our presiding spirit and he still is even though he's no longer with us\nAnd bill Kurdish has a voice that's on loan from the heavens and he also much like Carl has a really interesting sense of humor gosh yes yes and he runs a little so we say salacious I Believe is the public radio were will use\nAnd every now and then our audience gets a glimpse of that but my favorite thing is when off air he'll let loose with the profanity\nAnd it is stunning to hear that voice you that language oh my gosh you can it can boil the hair right off the what's quite fun before we go who richer the music the music of course was written by BJ Lederman what a coincidence coincidence ours do did you ask them\nWhat the heck that noise is at the beginning of our team almost as if he's starting to the music by like pushing a whole bunch of empty glasses off as being a we have no idea of you and ask him I've never known\nThe twentieth anniversary wait wait don't tell me spectacular airs this weekend to me at least protecting your Peter Sagal thanks so much for joining us think he's got an thanks for that more money [laughter]\n\nAlthough we end is near by the book the story about a violin [noise]",
