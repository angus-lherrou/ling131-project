seemed to close in over our heads as you come up to the house [noise]\nUm [noise]\nThis tiny little sort of to up to the workers college which looks like something as a Grimm's fairy tales\nThat was quite eerie [noise]\nSo I arrive at it and I made Gregory\nShane had learned that Gregory continuously sneaking off at night into the woods [noise]\nShe had reddish blond hair grayish blue eyes\nHe was maybe a little bit on the small side and he doesn't really want to talk to me as a everyone imagines when you work with kids that you know conversation flows immediately and it didn't it all the

felt that maybe she did understand an awful lot more than we assumed he did\nShane haven't really talked about the situation with anybody outside the family\nSo he can fight it in the school principal who is also a friend and could perhaps shed some light on this mysterious boy who lived in the woods\nHe kinda suggested that I had some has stepped in to kind of like a rural legend about a girl who had\nBecome pregnant by\nHer father father had brought her out into the woods to a cabinet\nBut he had captured there and made her have her child in the shock\nOn the story went that she gradually became crazier and lonely or an more strange that you took to wandering\nThe parts of the forest\nIt's um shame that got some newspaper clippings about this local\nLegend that did it back to the mid nineties eighties one mentioned that the woman's child had been ten years old\nWe were never given the name of the little boy however the name of the man who allegedly fathered this child was Thomas asserted article told her for suicide\nThis woman had taken herself as into the woods had hundreds of and there was a photograph of the living room of the house that this woman who\nLived in and it

the ... somebody related to this family but again I realized that was grasping at straws and I was now starting to think\nI really don't know what's going on anymore\nBut Shane kept poking at it\nAccording to one newspaper clipping there was a local priest befriended the woman\nAnd he was still alive but when chain went to the and the men didn't want to talk [noise] Shane was running out of lead to chase [noise]\nI got a call from or a law she was borderline hysterical\nGregory was gone at this time it was different or had been preparing breakfast in the kitchen when suddenly Gregory shop\nPastor and out the back door she called after him only to see him run into the woods [noise]\nAnd he wasn't alone [noise] there was another boy pulling Gregory by the hand [noise]\nDid call the police but there was that their reaction was looking at literally he's only gone and he's got an hour is run away before if he's not back by this evening give us a call again kind of thing they were growing weary of the case at that stage I colds George tailor the principle of the school who was my friend and who knew the words and\n[noise]\nWe could see two distinct\nSets of tracks or they were heading north eventually after a couple of hours we came across a kind of a hollow in the woods\nIn the ... there was an old shock an old stone ruins\nGregory was lying up against the wall of this shock sleep which I thought was very strange why he would have gone to sleep but he was I went down into the hollow to Gregory I remember I kneeled down beside a local [noise]\nAs I did that suddenly be heard the sound of a child's cry it seemed to be coming from all around and kind of in my head as well [noise] I said to Gregory you know where it's Thomas where is he [noise] he says he's over there\nI looked over there was a child standing a distance away in the trees could see that he was\nWearing the kind of like an on Iraq with the buttons and he had to hold on [noise]\nI remember I saw my eye off is to say something again to Gregory and when I look to us closer impossibly closer he took them to bridge to distance in the tide but until [noise] and I left again and he was closer again at the stage I could actually\nSee him quite well\nCan actually see a kind of grass stains or must stay on the needs of his jeans and the sounds of the crying\nMarried or [noise] it was\nSo like the first time [noise] I remember I picked up Gregory um gays and to George George with we got we have to get outta here you know we need to go\nBut there was still part of me the money to to help this case here he was he was standing right in front of me and he looked like a a boy I held up\nMy hand they said come on come with us you know we we can talk about whatever's going on [noise]\nAs I said I asked some thing across his face so I don't know whether it was the look\nOf beer or lack of Bangor or a lot of uncertainty but it was like a rope tied around his waist some needs to be pulled back through the trees [noise]\n\nWas gone ... just ...\nYou\nTook Gregory and we started walking back home and I remember him saying to me is is he gone though is Thomas gone [laughter] I didn't have an answer I didn't know what to say [noise]\nOne afternoon I'm In the office and suddenly I look up and father Malone standing in the doorway\nFather Malone is a local priest Shane had tried talking two days before\nAnd he's clearly very distressed and she tells me that he had to come clean\nHe didn't know more about the woman in the woods\nFather Malone had visited her often she told them that she had been having violent thoughts towards her son\nShe had been thinking about killing him\nHe said he hadn't really know what to do so he just offered listening ear than this one afternoon he arrived at the house you knocked on the door and there was no answer and he was about to leave when he saw the woman walking out of the trees there was blood on her clothes\nSmears of blood on her face she told him that she had murders or something\nWhen father Malone went to the police they didn't bother to investigate\n\nEverybody believed that the boy didn't exist that this was a figment of the woman's imagination\nMonths later the woman hunger south\nOh father told me sort of that law we were seeing was the on quiet go stir the spirit of the little boy who had been murdered [noise] well [noise]\nI kind of didn't really know what to say other than it added up it it I suppose kind of almost completed a circle in terms of\nEverything that I've been going on [noise]\n\nA couple of days later father Malone and Orlando and Gregory in myself went into the woods that'd be hard to come to light ceremony\nThey didn't go too far into the wet\nJust about twenty yards from the Senate and house and they sit in a looser I'm\nGregory held candles which during the ceremony father Malone lists them from\nAnd fundamental wanted to acknowledge what has happened to him and I know the closure is quite important but as to what the outcome was going to be I really had no idea and he said a few words just blessing Thomas and uh you know the\nReal wished for him to be accepted into into heaven\nShane had explained to grant green that they were saying goodbye to his friend [noise] I think he felt glad to tell us a gun somewhere where he was happy and safe at one point in the corner of my I assigned seat I might have seen a little figure among the trees bus [noise]\nHe told them that they were not going to pass and everyone was going to wait there and he didn't find themselves as Louis on the\n[noise]\nFirst off we thought well this must be a real agent just playing a joke it's a very sick joke and we don't like it we don't appreciate it but it's got to beat that [noise]\nAnd it was the group's themselves that it's that finally convinced is that this most definitely was nobody playing a trick all of them said we can see through him he's trans parent if blows across the train as he walks\nSo these encounters started stacking up and\nEventually destroyed just got out it was just happening too much and and this was one of those rare occasions where ghost stories and the paranormal was talked about out in the open at the station even by management and nobody was laugh and everyone's just shaking their head like\nI have no idea what's going on but this is legit and as time went by his operation was seen progressively moving toward the down but over time lakes\nAnd it was moving that way along one of the roots and we didn't know what to do with it or do about it [noise] the traffic even started to cease in that area after dark we got feedback but some of the smugglers were afraid to take their groups there some of the agents didn't even want to work area [noise]\nThey were scared in one case a group had gotten left behind by their guide and they had run out of water had no food and they were just about done for and\nThey were telling this to the eighties the next day that had caught them they said a a border patrol agent came up to his last night\nBut he didn't seem real but you started to talk to us and he told us if we follow this trail you'll find water at the bottom and we did exactly like he told us and he saved our lives and that kinda told us that\nSantiago was vendetta was against the guidelines\nAnd that's the only time he ever held to a group [noise]\nOne night I was assigned to the damn area and I sat for two or three hours next to the list were agents aren't jago fail and by that time I had heard you know ten or Fifteen of these different encounters in my head was just swimming trying to figure out what's going on with this and\nYou know why is this happening and\nAnd I actually high to down a rock climb down the cliff to the bottom were agents on Chicago had died\nAll the medical equipment was still there from when they had tried to treat him\nAs she was there the gloves and there's like a fresh taken the gut and begin to wonder how do I not been sick and then there would that change the equation would this not have happened and after a few minutes that I just climbed back to the topic or try to my mind on something else [noise]\nAnd then finally on a January twenty second Nineteen Ninety six there was a group detected coming up those cliffs agent or low responded to it and when he got there this group started screaming at border patrol agent shooting his weapon at chase\nThem toward that cliff six of them went off the cliff one of them was killed instantly but the man killed was to smoke or\nSo agent Carlo the agent that responded first came under suspicion of having done this and the FBI did a perfect test on his hand and his weapon and it came back that are low had not fired a gun and his weapon had not been fired either\nSo that kind of cleared him but he still they're suspect so they do a lineup and the people who survived that didn't go over the edge can't pick our lower out of the line up and they're actually very insistent that\nWas not are low than chase them over it was a different age and [noise] so they're kind of hitting a dead end here [noise] and then finally one of the agency that was helping the behind the investigation walked out went into the hallway\nTo good photo down and he didn't say anything to the FBI said why don't you show this to him and all of them immediately identify demanding the pitcher as the one who chased him toward the cliff shooting at them\nAnd so the FBI in you know call this guy in and let's get on and then that's when the border patrol agents told them said well you can't\nAnd that cliff last year [noise]\nThe theory that makes the most sense to me is that the smuggler that went over in the very last encounter was the one that pushed him over\nAnd he got his vengeance for his own death [noise]\nNo one ever claimed to see if I had the border patrol agent again after that\n\nBut the night of his memorial service I went home and went to bed and I was sleeping along pretty sound\nAnd in the middle of the night I was woken up by the very same distress signal that I had heard denied ... death and sure enough it was my radio going off again\nAnd and I looked over at the clock the clock and said well those too so I was just sitting there holding this time and shivers were going up and down my spine because now they had a whole new meaning and I had this overwhelming\nFeeling that somebody was on that radio and they wanted me to press that talk about it and say something\nAnd I couldn't do it because I was convinced I Would get an answer back idea I I don't know what I Would have said to him I guess I didn't\nKnow if he would say you know where were you why weren't you there if I didn't you come to work at night or if he was just going to say goodbye\nI didn't know I just didn't have the courage to press a button and find out\n[noise]\n\nThank you so much to rocky Elmore for sharing this story snap
