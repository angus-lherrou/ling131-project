Kurdistan to scale the famous yellow that\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year\nA destination yes the\nClimbers we're used to massive peaks and dangerous clear faces but still as their helicopter descended into the ... valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away\nProbably what impact of this none of us that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than mountains are then everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle and I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for\nA minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy\nAnd smiling from the area and he was patting me on the back and asking me if\nA soldier they looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the shoulder and they're like little dogs like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between\nTrying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I've tried to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they ... they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning\nDictator type figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nHe explained that John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was going to get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue\nTheir best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary [noise]\nUm I mentioned a job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself were pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to\nTake matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody an end in some ways we we we didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we had seen them murder\nSomebody I very much so I'm as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nJason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know\nStabbed their next with sticks damage out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in his voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throat so am I going to jump on this guy and just by just throw his teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others um\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of their captors ... split on\nNow is only two characters with guns to for climber in\nThe ... and walked for a whole night and invested for a day and then did again and\nThey did this for three days starving and I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies\nAnd then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we took gases and it turns out that had been five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy change completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard\nWe're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there is a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet is [noise]\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was saying and and obviously meant that he had bombed the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad in Denali [noise]\nYou know your shirt pleading with him not to go into dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him enough ago he he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew lets see up the mountain now it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere is just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun\nWith four other kids I completely changed everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\nUm\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this was going to happen and we all started\nKind of moving up the mountain together and I'm always trying to find a I'm trying to always\nKind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell they were there like this is the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this do you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything to do and will be morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy and just kind of came flying over the top\nOver behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all\nAnd but as I was reaching out to grab is God's job the sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and you just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down and so he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then best showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me and raptor arms around me\nAnd just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um [noise] and I remember saying like I don't know how you could love me after I've done this\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like ... cranks revolving for like one two one two something like that you gotta you know you had a sense of joy and you're just like wind down it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy do until\nOne day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with a male formation in his ...\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with grand mal formations\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... ... email formations had nothing to do with one another [noise] but ... didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would result [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when it's going to became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way out there it's like I say there's about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nUh just Knox started coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nCenter was scared his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise]\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story about playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all men are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure\nEven if they help you know\nThere was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regrets about my own surgeries because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day [noise]\nTime\nMinute to him that one of my biggest regrets surgeries and and my surgeries if not [noise] it's made me a ... somewhat better person at times [noise] um\nSo and I get a little fish philosophical with you there is a\nContract [laughter] okay um so\nIn like Julie ... story with Amy I'm been choice to question who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nI'm Wondering if that's ten term is by her brain or something less physical and I wonder what your thoughts are\nMy only problem in mind the intersection of all of those things somewhere there\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from hypothetical to their real\nWith having severe headaches again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to harbor medical center in Seattle when we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent so it was just talking butter Jeb Bush\nBut it's bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read\nAnd there for a few minutes as I watched and try to catch his breath I I thought we would lose and\n\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to ... hospital room in the ice you [noise] to see him [noise] in a coma in\nA condition than I Am who only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union\nOne\nWants to take a short

never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nCenter and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated he's family his mom and dad Steven as British do had to decide what to do and to me they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons name was Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now there was a one to five percent chance it's been two would have another strip\nAnd that chance would increase every year of his life but the surgery he was proposing with very risky when Dr came with explaining these very daunting odds any recorded him\nBecause you could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nSome risk associated with it and\nAbout five to ten percent chance of major complication from the surgery or mine or ... or anything in between um
