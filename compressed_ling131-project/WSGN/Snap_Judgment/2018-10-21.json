kind of poking around there were a lot of\nOld clothes holes dress busts a old\nVinyl records and\nAn entire rack on the back wall of life magazine dating back to [noise] you know God Knows when neatly catalogued so it really looked like this was somebody's whole life up here [noise]\nI [noise]\nNow like we were invading someone else's me [noise]\nI remember feeling like I was surrounded by

isn't yours don't touch it [noise]\n\nIt wasn't just old magazines records up there in the attic\nLooking around I remember distinctly seen a rope tied to one of the rafters and cut at the not

pat on the weekends and with their mom during the week when to catch up with their mom Fred was all alone and how\nI was\nGetting ready to go to work I had a a a daytime appointment book which was vital to me\nAnd I was in a rush\nAnd I had to\nPut this book on top of a better or post these were the stairs leading to the front door downstairs and I put it on a post to simply time my shoes now I Know I put it on the post is\nNo doubt I bend down time my shoe I get up and it's gone [noise]\nI went so far to go into the garage to see if I left it in my car I'm I have to find this one [noise] I'd come back and it's on the post flipped over upside down [noise]\nAnd I just grabbed it and ran out of the house\nAnd then there was a light in the attic\nAt least once or twice a week when I Would come home the addict like would be on so much so that I Would have to I Will be the only one really to access go upstairs shut it off of course it would creep me out you\nTried to rationalize I don't want to believe that something is here messing with me\nOn the weekends when cat and micro with him\nThe cat in my can help to pick up on the fact that something was off about the apartment\nOr you can see things that other corner of your eyes and as soon as it turns them nothing would be there\nI\nCould barely ever sleep so I'm lying in bed awake [noise]\nAh [noise]\nWith my door open hallway laid on\nTrying to ignore the uneasy feeling that was always president and [noise]\nI er here\nThink turn on in the kitchen [noise] ah everyone is in their separate bedrooms and I know nobody turned it on [noise]\n\nFred Mike and cat never told each other they thought something was going on they can barely believe it themselves still about six months after moving in del decided to should get a kitten we got the cat\nAs kind of a warm fuzzy presence in the house I think we're all feeling like\nTurmoil and darkness kind of going on in our personal lives that we just wanted something\nTo come home every day and I remember we were so excited\nTo bring the cat homes [noise]\nShe was just such a warm three kittens\nIt was really nice to have her around [noise]\nThe kittens seem to make the apartment a little brighter\nSide could sleep through the night when kids for gun kitten would snuggle up next to him\nBut then something happens [noise]\nMy bedroom was always dark dingy I remember we painted clouds all over my walls to try to break it up and make it feel a little more cheery and but I still had this feeling of dread every time I go into my bedroom [noise]\nCats are having really existed recurring nightmares [noise] there would be a man standing over my bad staring down at me watching these sleep and he would take his fingers and run them down the flash on my face\nAnd I began waking up with scratches [noise]\nAt first read that they can maybe scratching his doctors face [noise]\nBut she was in [noise] my dad decided that he was going to try something to see if this would help because I think he was worried that if\nIt's to tape mittens to me\nAt night to see if I could stop myself\nFrom scratching and still I Would wake up wet scratches on my face [noise]\nI almost feel like this thing was kind of feeding on our energy we were in a bad state we all were traumatized we had a lot of negative things going on in our lives it was a it was a bad transition for for all of us [noise]\nAnd I think that definitely awoke whatever was there and made things worse [noise]\nFred cat and make were close and he managed to find comfort in each other and thinks that the apartment got to be too much\nWeekends at the apartment my dad and I would go out all day we would spend the day\nOutside doing fun things just trying to get some fresh\nAir and lighten the mood a little bat\nA one day\nWe came home\nAnd we could hear\nThe cat and yelling [noise] but she didn't come running to us and usually the second we came home she kind of Trump's the kitchen and say hello and we thought it was odd that she's not anywhere to be found but we can hear her soft little meow\nSo making eye and dad we searched all over the house looking for the cat thinking like maybe she got stuck in a closet who knows what happened I'm and I found her\nIn my bedroom and\nWrapped around her neck and she was hanging off of my bed [noise]\nWas terrified [noise] that was\nJust a sickening terrifying feeling like something had gotten her [noise]", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "21"}
