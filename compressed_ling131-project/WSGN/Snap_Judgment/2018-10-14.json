thousand north bay sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow\n[noise]\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year\nAnd a destination yes [noise]\n[noise] the climbers we're used to massive peaks and dangerous clear faces but still as their helicopter descended into the ... valley and the yellow law came into view they were blown away\nProbably would impact of this and the most that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than mountains are then everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to\nGet up ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance and instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nAnd I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I'm very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for\nA minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he was patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the switch shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cars and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they pray and they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion and\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator type figure several large movements to install a Muslim state\nJohn that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was going to get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then we're all going to go home\nThey kept his plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue\nTheir best shot at living was to skate by any means necessary [noise]\nUm I mentioned the John that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember that than myself we're pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out\nJason a John wanted to take\nMatters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we we didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though he had seen them murder somebody I very much a\nThem as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it\nSound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and I'm going to jump on this guy and just by his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others Mm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain one of the characters are ... split on\nNow is only two characters with guns\nThey did this for three days starving and I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we took guesses and\nIt turns out it had been five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on ... we were starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guns Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of set in a weird way of ... we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously meant that he had bought the story that I spent a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to know [noise]\nHis shirt pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was had to tear himself away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to not go he he had this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one\nAll that excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and the anger named a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids as I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on this sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so\nJohn and I immediately\n\nCommunicated with each other that that was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up this\nMountain together and I'm always trying to find a\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you could tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside\nWas maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this do you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but\nAt this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing up the\nClass and it just sort of scrambled up\nOver behind him and she wasn't expecting\nIt at all um but as I was reaching out to grab his guns drop the sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me and we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he hit the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and his whole body let out of this really horrible uh cracking sound has really allowed and then he tumbled off of the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just started\nFalling um [noise] and then\nAnd wrap your arms around me\nAnd just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um and I remember saying like I don't know how you could love me after I've done this\nLiked it I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like ... cranks revolving just felt like one two one two something like that you gotta you know you had that sense of joy and you're just like wind down it\nWhen he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with a now formation in his brain\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain mouth formations\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... brain Mel formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but it's been through brain situation didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would result [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when it's going to became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery\nNo matter what I didn't\nEven bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the NATO rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone\nOr you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way I was like I say there's about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nAh just knocked started coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was real scared of [noise]\nA different person since I was scared his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise]\nSometimes people experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take your picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind and gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the brain you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all met her from it made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nSurgery innocent connection treasure\nI had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regrets about my own surgery is because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day [noise]\nTime\nMinute to him not one of my biggest regrets surgeries and and my surgeries if not [noise] it's made me a ... somewhat better person at times\nUm\nShow and I get a little fish philosophical with you there is a contract [laughter] okay um so in like Julie ... story with Amy I'm been choice to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that's ten term is by our brain or something less physical and I wonder your thoughts are\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from hypothetical because they're real expensive with having severe headache it again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to harbor medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent so it was just talking butter ... British and shortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at the foot of his bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I've eve\nAnd there for a few minutes as I watched him try to catch his breath I I I thought we would lose them\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to splinters hospital room in the u._s. you [noise] to see them [noise] in a coma in\nA condition that I Hope only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI wished I could have been union\n[noise]\nOh I\nWant to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should never have to make snap judgment override episode continues stay too [noise]\nIs it going this American Life\nOne month before Seventeen people died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida the school did this intense training everybody in the school board revamped new procedures what they were supposed to do in case someone showed up at school and started shooting\nAnd we wondered did it help Seventeen people does this save was did make things worse\nTeachers way and this week\nIs that if you knew from two to three point three WBAI Egypt [noise]\nGood afternoon this is Ninety point three WBAI Jan and went out for what five of them in Fort Paine public radio for the heart of Alabama great to have you with us [noise]\n[laughter]\n\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever podcasts are found\n[noise]\nWNYC Studios walking back to snap judgment override episode when it was in Washington and we left off young man Spencer you lay unconscious some hospital because of a Mel formation in his brain and all of his family knew was that no matter what\nHe never ever wanted to have brain surgery oh\nSpencer and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated his family his mom and dad Steven as British do had to decide what to do it differently they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons name was Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now they were the one to five percent chance it's been two would have another stroke and that chance would ...\nA risky ... without the came with explaining very daunting odds any recording him because she could go back and listen to when he said over and over\nAt some risk associated with it about five to ten percent chance of a major complications from surgery or mine or ... or anything in between um\nI Know that my heart surgery before this half [noise]\nI'd make that the situation in a dramatic change and knowing that we know now with all that you know what would you want us to do and I think that's the position of putting your guys in is to make that determination nobody in the world knows him better than the three of you know so [noise] um so it's not what you want or what I Want to read or what mom or dad on business\nWhat would you want and that's where I where I\nHave you ever performed another surgery with a typical ... area of the brand new naturally yes okay in that deep Kevin ... ds project that sort of done multiple how I Know that there's risk but it's not a theoretical risks are real risk if it happened all those particular surgeries\nThat you've done in that area what was the outcome will be able to pay ... percent of them five to ten percent of them will have a bad outcome\nThe one that they wish they hadn't done the operation\nAnd you'll go crazy tried to convince yourself that you can figure out if he's going to have a complication around and you can't you just keep going around in circles wondering like well we knew it\nYou know I think it's important that it's an intellectual decision but it's also an intuitive one I think the best decisions are like you have to feel good about it and not just in your rationalizing and so forth but also you're Scott\nAnd listen to your gut instinct Dr Kim Luft room any like Steve Chu and said [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "14"}
