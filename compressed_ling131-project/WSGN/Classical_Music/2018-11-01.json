arrive at a huge room that seems to be filled with some kind of cages\nAsked me start walking\nI'm hearing conversation [noise]\nThe hallway were all listening\nTo this people talking it's very muffled it's very distant [noise]\nThe officer decides OK tells us girls you stay here I'm going to go check out and see what's going on down the hallway so he goes down and he's got his hand on his gun [noise]\nHe gets down to the end of that whole way\nHe comes back he says there's nobody there and the conversation he's had stopped as soon as she got a certain point down the hallway you didn't hear anything anymore\nAnd we sit down on the ground we get our audio out\nMarcia starts asking a few questions to ... whoever might still be in that room with us and she's asking\nHow do you feel about not getting out how do you feel about being trapped in here and that's when all hell breaks loose [noise]\nThe wrong starts shaking and reverberating [noise]\nI feel this burning pain along my lower back\nI turn around and plus my shirt to see what's happened and I see this angry red marked across my lower back [noise]\n\nThe officer jumps\nAnd we go tearing off their shadows in cold breeze is running past\nMoving down the hallway it looks like we've landed in one of those ... paintings every single time you think you're going to escape you end up back where you started [noise]\n\nWe come up into this enormous room ...\nAnd I said ... holy crap and\nThis is the same room where we started\nThat's the door with a glass panel that's the one we came in like this is it we're getting out\nMm\nThe officer tries to the door and it's locked and I said no that's not possible it can't be locked because it was open when we came in so I go and I tried the door and I can't make it open officer mark tells us to stand back and he starts kicking\nThe door and he kicks it with all of force and he kicks it over and over and over again to the point where I start to get nervous and I think All right it's clearly locked almost instantaneously the hysteria level goes [noise]\nOfficer mark stopped taking it or we start walking we ended up in this room [noise] Marcia turns around us and says this is going to end [noise] now [noise]\nShe has a look on her face that I don't recognize [noise] she goes over to the corner and she accepted the continental looks like a crow bar but I don't know what it is she's start\nWailing on his window with all of the force and it's making a tremendous racket [noise]\nAnd at the same time mark is running around literally like going in circles pacing around in circles in his hand on his gun\nI don't know what's going on around anymore he's not listening to me and so I just wander up to this window looking over a courtyard and I hold on to the bars and I looked down there and I just realize [noise] I'm never leaving [noise]\nAnd this is where it gets difficult to talk about\nBecause\nI'm starting to feel like myself\nAnymore\nWas gone I Know there are patients behind me I Know that they're sitting there and they're watching TV I Know they're drugged in the corners I Know there are strapped in their beds\nAnd he was holding onto these bars looking down at a courtyard that I knew I was never ever ever going to see again\nAnd I remember telling myself this story about my life and I'm a professor at a college remember that remember that\nAnd I'm thinking about my kid I'm thinking about my husband and everything in my life how much I appreciated it at the same time somebody was trying to take it away from\nMe and it was the most hopeless the saddest thing I've ever felt my life\nFrom behind a tree I remember seeing this woman appear\nWho seemed almost more like a vision than an actual person because she's dressed completely and white and Marshall leans over and says hey hey up here\nWe're trapped we have to get out of here we got in and now we can't get out and can you please help us\nAnd she's responding to us it's okay it's okay don't panic so then\nWe grab our stuff as we're heading back we don't feel anything or no dark shadows are shapes we can still see the lady in\nWhite waved to her she waves back we keep moving down and eventually we find the original door we can see this didn't marks around the bottom where officer\nMark was kicking it with all of his spores and I know the doors locked and we see her coming down she literally looks to be\nGlowing they see her come up to the door lean down a little bit round the handle and she opens the door [noise]\n\n\nLike you so much cursing for sharing that
