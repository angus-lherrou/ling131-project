Hi I'm actually in room eleven thirty six can you hear me can you hear me [noise] [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except every now and then turn just last to herself\n[noise] that is\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds for forty four seconds and then when the recording you're here\n[laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tries to door handles again thinking she told me later you know this can really be true I just can't there's got to be with us going to work\nOne wall of the closet has the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car lock yourself in she hears people she hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall unfortunately\nShe actually has the skills for this very situation [noise]\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for a little bit\nAnd then they do nothing [noise]\n[laughter]\nOr has been as

see her and she was so nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI Know this is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that [laughter]\nI don't know I didn't think of it than\nNot turned remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about spectacle you know eighty people from the stage and horses in of vengeance and be grand\nFeeling the what's really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in space not much bigger than your body it is the symbolism pot imaginable
