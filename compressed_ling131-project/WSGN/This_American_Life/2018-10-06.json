face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us in the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's dean and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something they'd been living with for a long time and they're in ...\nThat is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is\nA more serious one anyway here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on the way I Hope it don't get jury duty [noise] but I was more curious than interested in like the the process and you know I liked watching stuff like law and order and other things like that\nSVU criminal intent spend like them all he was a software developer newly married and he and his wife just bought a new house his first\nI could have changed\nUm [noise]\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted Paul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should or given me and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are like ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nI did begin reply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like it really wrecked brings up\n\nA few months after ... men receive Maryland's email and execution date was set the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward\nIt seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not\nLike Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent\nStories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI\nI Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not trying [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or as even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain unnerved until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would reads and I hope I'm not being too forward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forwards originally email just fan\nOnce you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nExpecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son\nCartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent an email and the first place\n... ah you know I have like I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all since [noise]\nBy some uh some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in a hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering her food but she can't stop refusing you want to have a coffee or tea Maryland is tall and stately with\nThe end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life of the party I mean I was a jokester all makes you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the power to go on I was always kind of the ones that everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though\nIs how the people who remain the people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the rubble and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member were polished to cause the bottom of this and that was a very hurtful it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job no Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a hard thing\nMm Mm [noise] um\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to in Maryland right spends article and she saw him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nThey actually gay descendants the death penalty\nI thought I had literally died it didn't even register because I'm just like you know what just happened what have they done you know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read and okay what is it\nYou can only tell them what kind of person he is and I want people to know you know everybody's ... they assumed that if you involved in a heinous crime like that the truth monster but he went to the monster\n[noise]\nYou know OK so she is going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for us\nI think that probably than than sit in at the end it's been yeah yeah\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before he gets it [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spanned is at the door\n[noise] and then I Jonathan is very nice things and Maryland is here now how do you\nStand there was no okay\nI get a lot of trouble when lingers in the door the hotel room\nAnd a half a seat over there uh\nHe's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous and so there were there with a lifetime Maryland in ... and then in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMarilyn was seated behind the bar spent sat in the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] I read and re read it\nAnd I even began so her letters or never went anywhere and I were to say what do you say about\nThat I don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the vote was cast I have regrets I thought I'm doing wrong and\nAlthough it was great hearings or do you know forgive man couldn't forgive myself exactly and I can't even imagine how you most real\nFirst of all I Want to say I don't want you to feel shame because you know my son was involved in a in a in a a crime [noise] um he made a wrong choice", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018",
