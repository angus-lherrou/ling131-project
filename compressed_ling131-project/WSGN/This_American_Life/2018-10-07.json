there I was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but may I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it\nAnd I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same about income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst oh I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong that even watching it was emotional it was upsetting [noise] and then since that hearing we've had this week a waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelief that the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAnd incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean like they have to cast a vote in the United states\n... and our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nBoth those people having to make these huge decisions they are not comfortable with hall [noise] WB Z Chicago this American Life America stay with us [noise]\n[noise] but [noise] judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided didn't seem like a no on Kevin up there was a yes that was let's wait a week is if we can be the Senate wait for new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA producers though which is it's been a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet out here in watching what was going through and talking to him about how we made us choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't as clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview ... these can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nDashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was stuck you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nWhat they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declare that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that he was confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party\nGood morning when that elevator dorm close to where Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't and reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn online site support the heroes who convinced fleet read over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days [noise] lots of people loved his version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of\nThese last two weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and this morning that they have any mind also we talked about it\nWasn't the ... and there was a it\nWas the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that\nI've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault\nIt's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nOut easily Portland\nSupport when he was only one way and therefore we believe women when you think\nYou can't replace what do you have to say please [noise] about something you didn't say the winning right now in the survivor glad we're having this er into this\nAre you going to do the right to\nDoes it affect you and people like that [noise]\nBenefit severe shovel\nThe sleek making fun of himself talked about this before with lots of mend his age doesn't connect you well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nAnd I want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now I don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that and then we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this rain today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happened here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't this off putting to him as they thought it might be\nThe staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything a in a decision on a vote 'em it's been it's just\nIt's a debate with staff are discussions late\nLast night too and uh\nIt was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\nNext morning of course like finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the ... got to come back to\nSettle for something to the ...\nGoes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and he gets the news that flakes he yes he chokes up reportedly says\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason\nBegins the two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably checks Twitter 'cause usually does but he says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR bit says he wasn't thinking about that at all so he comes back\nAnd then Coons gives a speech at the committee meeting that he said was directed at one man Jeff Flake\nI'm really trying not to eat\nI like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said\nWhy did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied with the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joyous people [laughter] that stuff [noise] I uh [noise] chocolate chip are only about a party [laughter]\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no file to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\nEver [noise]\n[noise]\nVery chase ... program which turned out it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today a justice of potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through it well I like my own ... ah\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in a political way\nThe frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation or to recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court\nDo\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and uh the character\nI my self was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\n... southern southern southern so the Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asking bed a staple cases you've always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explain this job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um and discuss the case\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the least senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issues of public policy involved\nUm we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it and\nLet's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale\nThe principle of the reasons that you get and let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all as we realize one of us will have to write an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people uh an opinion that explains\nIt teaches the principles of war the principles of the constitution or the control of the result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular caves uh we draw down on a capital of trust we make a withdrawal and the trust in the public has been our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nOkay one more story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just\nKind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama and I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was at nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes so I said well do you have any questions and a one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well\nI'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and if they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the briefs the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have a separate playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera cases [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded\nKind of what intellectually pretentious or you know here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those briefs I said oh it is that about one sixth ... sixth back [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack\nWho's done where like beer [noise]\nThanks to reform club the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete amateur has to decide to death sentence so many previous experience in these manners\nWatching law and order that's in a minute ... radio when our program continues [noise]\nI'm Mary Scott hygiene WB H in if you for you because someone else took that first ad from being a listener to being an ... individual contributions and thousands of men bears give WB age and the money we need to pay for the programs you listen to every day that's why we're asking you to take that\nAnd then you mean by now when you get at ... dot org\n[noise]\nYou're hearing this American Life on your NPR station Ninety point three W. B. H M Birmingham or one oh four point five FM in Fort Paine public radio for the heart of Alabama\n[noise]\n\nJust American Life from Eric last today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that what about program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us in the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's teen and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with that wouldn't make right with another person usually it's something that had been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more serious one\nI mean here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on the way I Hope it don't get jury duty but I was more curious and interested in like the the process and you know I liked watching stuff like law and order and other things like that\nSVU criminal intent spend like them all he was a software developer newly married and he and his wife just bought a new house his first\nThat would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nCould let them live [noise]\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened\nSomething spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness which also weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nAs powerful as a a ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nI did begin to reply but I didn't\nDidn't help her courage to [noise] finishers under sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like a really rare things are\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was at the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward\nIt seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we\nDo not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nThey're not doing well should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not trying [noise]\nShame leads to inertia and is even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain and our until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with ... and I hope I'm not being too forward\nAsk Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much\nSo as well as my phone number with no reply she also forwards originally emailed us then once you send two years ago the one who can stop thinking about but I read it expecting\nA grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word\nInstead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\n... you know I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some [noise]\nSome uh some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meeting the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can stop her fusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea\nMaryland as a child and stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life on the party I mean I was a jokester all makes you you have Marilyn there 'cause she's going to keep the power to go on I was always kinda wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the mobile and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member what our policy is to cause the bottom of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFor him men working with her son\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality jobs she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I mean getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a hard thing\nMm Mm [noise] um\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland red spends article and she saw him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay descendants the death penalty\nI had that I I thought I had literally died they didn't even register because I'm just like you know what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read an okay what are they thinking what are they doing\n'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he is and I want people to know you know everybody's ... they assumed that if you involved in a heinous crime that the two monster but he wants a monster\n[noise]\nYou know if he's going to come up Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for us\nI think that probably than than sit in at the end it's been a fan\n[laughter]\nI Hope I get there before he gets it [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spend this at the door\n[noise] and then I found it and it's very nice things and you know and it's here now how do you\nThat then yeah okay [laughter]\nI get a lot of trouble then lingers in the door the hotel room\nAnd a house seat over there a\nHe's a spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous and so there were there with a lifetime Maryland in ... and then in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nAnd the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] a rather than I re read it\nAnd I even began so her letters or never went anywhere I Want to say what do you say about that\nI don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the vote was cast I have regrets I thought I'm doing wrong and\nAnd although it was great hearings are generally forgave man couldn't forgive myself exactly and I can't even imagine how you must feel\nOkay first of all I Want to say I don't want you to feel shame because you know my son was involved in a in a in a crime [noise] um he made a wrong choice", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "07"}
