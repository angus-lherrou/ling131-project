many years and back when he was working here at today's show is a rerun he made a decision to return to his childhood he went searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate and their parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan\nMe and her sitting in the back room telling about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up\nAnd they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it\nAnd on and on like that [noise] men Susan flipping through one of those time life books rock and roll through the decades sixties and she has long brown hair which incredibly skinny it's Nineteen Seventy

apparently doesn't want to be noticed especially by peculiar nine year old staring at him to the passenger window what are you looking at least near\nA turnaround vast and face the dashboard did he say something to you\nSusan asks what did he say to you nothing uh you didn't say anything it's fine look greenlight tell me what he said what did he say to you I stay silent and if I tell her what she said she got out of the car and try to kick his ass which scares me the comforts me too\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSusan Jordan was our babysitter she watch my sister and me every day after school for a couple of hours until our parents got home from work [noise] we didn't know any adults like her we loved her December before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen cashier at thrift way suits supermarket in Cincinnati\nWhere I Lived the place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and this isn't Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I check them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has made some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nAnd tell her to hold on I tried to get my break we can catch up she says great steps aside\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nFive ten Fifteen minutes bass I keep Glenn thing behind Susan making apologetic gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at me\nFinally test me in the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at thrift rape or two more years\nWhat drives me crazy that I never saw her again if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care somehow having her play with to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it'd be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten them all\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nMy mom likes or do you want to know I'm calling I Do I Do you remember she was in Jordan Wright\nIs George George\nYes it's bringing up out but I Can't place\nA she was our babysitter\nOh OK chicken legs and my pet\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced to her household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really had more of a relationship with you to that she did with us\nShe seemed to have a very meaningful relationship with you um are the kind of a relationship that you might have like another adult\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember you still find that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we still hope is that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we bonded and well\nHow desperately I guess I was looking for a family rarely that I mean it [laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean the people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\nI mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lotta times they it it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably thought what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it so you sort of\nTalk to us and said yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family\n...\nEvery time a subjective are hard times came up\nOn your settle hesitancy and to enjoy\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly\nIt wasn't until we've been talking for\nIm forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that had been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because uh there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but ah\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby sitter the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe proceeds in Jordan you're pro life that I remember\nIs he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like\nI didn't think of myself as we are at all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine I was anxious and bookish it was kind of uptight\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play when I went to your rooms\nI didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I got this right but it just seems like there were mostly folks and more educational things I mean I remember you had planned that send your room and a chemistry set\nAnd I didn't remember that cake had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had they not just in more serious in general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nYou know\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a deceived us about each other [noise] even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other day I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she mostly remembered a side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nBut we lived differently than the way I laughed and that's what I I did I wanted from I Know\n\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at ... or visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recordings\nOr you can find someone who knew you back then someone you haven't seen since they still carry within themselves the picture of you to send clouded by the years between\nThe remember you better than you remember yourself and you could do the same thing for them\n\nOut but he did that straight back when he was a producer here at our show now even had kept me company\nCalled ... media and he's the host pod cast without fail

mortgages dresses beautiful clothes clean cut\nBack in the Nineteen seventies in England where he grew up he was in a punk band called the automatic you'll never really big commercial success but they were respected known in the history of punk by people who care about that kind of thing\nThat a few years back there were not series of connections he ended up visiting his teenage years to the first time but going back on tour in a version of his band\nIn Japan here is that something that happened I mentioned it to a client\nAnd and I said well you know I I played in in in ... when I when I was a kitten and or you're not really interested in and then the next day he sent me a copy of over ... and so does this year\nAnd I sort of ... so it was and I watched this option I watched the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize\nWait a minute [laughter] time collectible\n[noise]\nSit down to brass tacks or how much ... I think that one actually when's that forty eight dollars I ...\nAnd um you know music business or offerings along punk lines\nAre but you know I don't want to live about an ounce of the time and it was good to see that uh [noise] you know that as their their ... value years later I mean it was it was one of\nThat history came out on the rights of it [noise] yes that ah there is a sort of Darwinism uh in in uh in record collecting [noise]\n\nWhatever that I went to conceive they keep the drama and I am Ricky collected everything and he very kindly lent me uh these two scrapbooks so I took pictures and and things out of that I just put it up on a had a friend put it up on the website\nAnd um\nThen I got an email from ... in um\nIn Japan's saying you know I play in Japanese punk

good thing to take my wife gets a oh you're you're approached by dozens of teenage girls I was getting stumped on the street so what happened the first that you went onstage well there was just you know the announcement\nUntil the moment planes\nIt was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] me [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThat the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared as way to lead his nation [noise]\nAnd\nThat our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\nGreatly me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude seconds me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and watch a little jittery here comes the Adam was on Capitol [laughter]\nWow [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] oh that's a that's the kind of thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nMean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven\nI memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that you're in your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably that's right the funds recite that at some point or there'll be a ball game or something\n[noise]\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\n\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know\nI mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ... ... ...\nI Wonder what the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old\nThis would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed and very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day ...\nOf motivation\nYou know just to have your petty little craft\nAnd you're putting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhat you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old does your thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah [noise] he would be very very disgusted to be heard this this

interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that she had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded when Michael be like a story from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music to here at the radio station to make it bully sound like story on our show\nIt destroyed that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nThat's university is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIf not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend got with the top\nIt was the
