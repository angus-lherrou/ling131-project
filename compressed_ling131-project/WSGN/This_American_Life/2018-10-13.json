them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into their building and a week and a half before school started after a bunch of training they're running their first\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around\nThe district in rural Ohio they let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air the day people on this team are we to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team this year was pollock watch them doing this\nWe used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations over the school I saw the run a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're gonna play tape of this is one of one listeners they're allowed gunshots from blanks\nThat he fired during these drills so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting\nInto the states you have to put your finger on the sensor is or do something\nAnd a little tricky\n\n[noise]\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shoe [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six to twelve he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun\nHe's ramble for best he's holding a walkie talkie very focused very aware of the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and one of these shootings another kid can kill nothing nothing in this way [noise]\nElementary awareness in the elementary when [noise]\nFeel elementary wearing the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school goes into lockdown\nThe he and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nNow does robbing he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go we go [noise] ...\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything it just tightening their side and that was great\nThat was the turning you compare to the first time yeah oh yeah it was it was here is the doors [noise]\n\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was\nThe right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and and so I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd one exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss there's a possibility if somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nI Can't let it be me who hurts us doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to be one of his students in a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed\nBut these\n[noise]\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nDid they interpret them we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks a pass to dispute the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can\nAnd it's still not enough to where people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nFrom WBEZ in Chicago it's this American Life America ...\n[noise] [noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhaul of the schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than workday I mean they knew what to me and even still even with that we still had\nCasualties have the people that are going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it was actually an open question what about producers Robin ... went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThey did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments multiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night\nAnd a good hard think and being proactive once she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for ... this is what a code black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with\nThe kid was you have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were ... silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors with paper and leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see and\nThat's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing are cool\nBut she did\nActually remembers being trained with other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nThe audio is of the I Believe if I remember correctly it's at the front office and one of the lady that called in with a shooter is outside the door and you can hear her like her voice drops and she's like he's right outside of genocide and you can hear the the dispatch officer telling her you know don't move and be quiet\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness\nLeave them leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what she'd been time\nYou can choose to follow the protocol\nFollow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\nHer classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency fall\nAnd the group is small enough to fitness applied causes some wants to told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet and it was hot and dark except students faces look by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was ... and her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from\nHer for a while in our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um has it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having the light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not because you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officer said this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooter saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up [noise]\nNice\nWas it told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to be\nEven did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the ...\nTo the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway they seized the teacher who's our most grazing she survived got Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open do he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both\nTold me that having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive\nBecause of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson research is what's effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfit safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best\nCheryl Johnson didn't want to get into this the civics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done but\nShe did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done it Douglas like tapering over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAt all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there's a gunman in the fall\n[noise] keeping classroom doors locked redound in yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talk to\nDang sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits and like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision and told her about actually curse how sheets dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student from a rose up right from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably and in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to pull those kids into her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school my daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide but when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one a classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school period\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nWhat my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricaded\nAnd I want her to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to reckon with\nAll want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe because it's the truth\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red I Want someone to say listen I there's a person with a gun in our school\nOf course I never want someone to say that at all\n\nIf you're at Douglas there are new Gates's new fences new cameras [noise] gym back searches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits in every room [noise]\nFifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one [noise]\nAnd they already did a code red trail only this time there was no confusion about one it would be [noise] school called parents told all the students and teachers in advance\nAnd starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nNoses before I was going on on the road [noise] taking drugs is ... because the strip orange or drugs or you're still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year develops those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks person can buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration in on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stepped in and broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting\nThis can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is warm parents about\nThey tell families to brace themselves\nOh Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting they got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado\nAbout a half hour after the movie started Jesse's prime called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone there was [noise]\n[noise] screaming just [noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable\nMaybe they were intruding\nThey weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband when we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nThat's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filter said there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from [noise]\nWell they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to\nParents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents have lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis was the moment that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child died in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on which they want you to get back to normal light mon brothers should they should know Seamus you were should you know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it [noise]\nThe Philips has and a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son in the shooting at Parkland Monica in that store at\nAnd let them at their house there's something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nThat said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nThe day of the shooting mentioned ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area\nFirst at a local hospital said she thought patient who mash next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents\nAnd waited every time the phone rings you jumped and think is Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like strange from these rooms\nThen their names were called out even walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... we couldn't even find your son you know and I hope that he was somewhere else and have to give them thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second ...\nMix body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries which did not\nOn a good says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again as Nicholas where it is a swimmer oh this summer's perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like ... it was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his chops destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him\nYes it was awful because your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an era Fifteen just so gross I'm so horrible horrible and I think to see him and to see on his body where his injuries were\nWere um\nMade me get it like he was so peaceful and he was not in pain and it made me have a better image of him than the one that was playing over and my mind", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "13"}
