I see like some things like I don't remember this kid he wrote this then came ... for me it's like you're pretty pretty as heroes and something like that but like I Can't remember\nTeachers really well like I used to do you feel sad about that it was said okay\nActually said about that because you know it it it's a part of me it's like you don't even remember what's happened it's kind of hard because it it was it's been a part of you [noise]\nWhen I ask ... which of her friends she wouldn't remember it all someday\nWasn't Hartford answer\nI'll probably for good um\nI think Lenny ... probably forget Diana and Maria offering it um [noise]\n...

never been there in the first place we forget most of everything and then sometimes we go back and try to remember that it really is no predicting which people and places moments we're going to be

back when he was working here at today's show is a rerun he made a decision to return to his childhood he went searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate and their parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan me and her sitting in the background and telling her about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and\nOn like that [noise] means Susan flipping through one of those time life books rock and roll through the decades sixties she has long brown hair which incredibly skinny\nIt's Nineteen Seventy five she's wearing bell bottom leave us a faded Jean jacket she points to a picture of a bloated man in the powder blue runs don't jumpsuit sitting cross legged on the stage before a crowd of crying women

things so when we put a stop light I start trying to notice the guy in the motorcycle next to us he apparently doesn't want to be noticed especially by peculiar nine year old staring at them to the passenger window what are you looking at least near\nA turnaround fast and face the dashboard did he say something to you Susan asks what did he say to you nothing or he didn't say anything it's fine look greenlight tell me what he said what did he say to you I stay silent\nMe too [noise]\n[noise]\nSusan Jordan was our babysitter [noise] she watched my sister and me every day after school for a couple of hours until her parents got home from work we didn't know any adults like her we loved her December before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\nLast time I saw was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived\nThe place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and this isn't Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I checked them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has made some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy\n[noise] meanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nTell her to hold on I'll Try to get my break we can catch up she says great steps aside\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nFive ten Fifteen minutes bass I keep granting behind Susan making apologized gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at me\nFinally test me in the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at two or three for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\n\nWhat drives me crazy that I never saw her again if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play with him he seemed like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it'd be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nMy mom\nJordan Wright is Jordan Jordan yes it's bringing up out but I Can't place a she was our babysitter\nOh OK chicken like in my past\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really had more of a relationship with you to that she did with us\nShe seemed to have a very meaningful relationship with you um are the kind of a relationship that you might have like another dollar\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember you so fondly those because I think it works both ways I think that we still have that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we bonded and\nWell I was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean they're people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\nI mean I\nI just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it so you sort of\nTalk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family\nOh\nEvery time the subject of are hard times came up\nOn your settled into what\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that occur in room or\nIt wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized when it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that I've been knowing it or our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAre and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\nParts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe person who's in Jordan Europe for life that I remember\nIs he or she just as soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like but\nI didn't think of myself as where at all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine I was anxious and bookish it was kind of uptight\nNot the same as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play when I went to your room\nI didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like there were mostly folks and more educational things I mean I remember you had planned it send your room a chemistry set\nAnd I didn't remember that case had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had they not just in more serious than general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship [noise] she said she mostly remembered the side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house but there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that ... people lived differently than the way I live and that's what I decided I wanted from I Know\n\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at ... or visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recording\nMore you can find someone who knew back then someone you haven't seen since [noise] there's still carry with them themselves picture of you to some clouded by the years between\nThe remember you better than you remember yourself and you could do the same thing for them\nOut\nBut he did that story back when he was the producer here at our show no pod casting company called ... media and he's the host pod cast without\nGod\nTo hunting a gray flannel suit [noise] for a long time David filled with the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in Beverly Hills as you might imagine in Beverly Hills they handle rather large mortgages dresses beautiful clothes clean cut\nBack in the Nineteen seventies in England where he grew up he was in a punk band called the automatic who never really big commercial success but they were respected known in the history of punk by people who care about that kind of thing\n... years back there not series of connections he ended up revisiting his teenage years for the first time but going back on tour in a version of his band in Japan\nHere is that something that happened I mentioned it to a client\nAnd and I said well you know I I played in um in the ... when I when I was a kitten and or you're not really interested in and then the next day he sent me a copy of over ... inside is is you\nAnd I said before so it was not watch this option I watched the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize\nWait a minute [laughter] time collectible [noise]\n\nSit down to brass tacks here how much ... I think that one actually when's it\nForty eight dollars I particularly like looking as you know all those sort of uh other groups that were going and twenty five cents [noise] um you know music video business\nOr offerings along punk lines are but you know I don't want to live out not to set the time and it was good\nTo see that uh [noise] you know ... values years later I mean it was it was wow that history came out on the rights of it [noise] yes\nThat ah there is a sort of Darwinism uh in in uh in record collecting [noise]\nWhatever that I went to conceive they keep the drama and Ricky collected everything and he very kindly\nLent me uh these two scrapbooks so I took pictures and and things out of that I just\nNow from ... in um\nIn Japan's saying you know I play in Japanese punk rock ... band and a ... a ... percent yes mhm\nAnd uh your record changed my life wow ... ... and he found out through the website that you know there was an on release down from somebody else you know if you could put me in touch with\nA ... of a base Michael Woods which we struck up a deal and then they said well would you come over here and play some gigs to uh you know from us [noise]\n\nSo so you go to ... how old are you at that point a forty five forty five years old or a little bit of gray hair coming in little plastic Rihanna come in and uh and and now we're really wasn't sure whether I'm you know I'd still be able to do it\nBecause I haven't played those songs in twenty two years\nYou know in my shower no to any one uh I mean\nPrior to being married I mean I remember dating women\nFor you know a year who never knew that I played as it has had ever played\n... you know they wouldn't even come up\nWouldn't come out really I may not have a guitar hanging around but you know lots of other guys did to would you ever pick of the guitar and play it for yourself yes I read lots of songs my dog during this period [laughter] some of the titles would be we going to the park was a big favorites\n[laughter] to be followed by that here too is a good boy [laughter] oh what a good boy is actually a it is [noise] what a lot of good boy [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nSo ah we whenever they want the type of the six I took my wife which\nPossibly was a ... was a miscalculation but [laughter] now is a good thing to take my wife because uh you you're approached by dozens of teenage girls I was getting stumped on the street\nSo what happened the first that you went onstage well there was just you know the announcement\nAnd it's sort of moment of silence\nThis was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] I mean [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThe deep thoughts of young Zionists as he prepared as way to lead his nation [noise]\nAnd\nThat our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army\nLet's see\nUm there's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes out of them was on Capitol [laughter]\nWow [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] oh that's a\nThat's a kind of thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that here I understand your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to fund recite that at some point or the baseball game or something just end up seeing it right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would predict would immediately become as scientists [noise]\n\nSixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fan\nYou know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean\nMaybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation may may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being\nThe future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions\nWon't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation\nYou know just to have your petty little craft and you're putting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself what you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah [noise] he would be very very disgusted to see her this this rating appease it would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nWhen we were angels [noise]\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get on to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you've gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like a story from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio for this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music to here at the radio station to make it bully sound like story on our show\nIs history that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top\n[noise] it was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\nUm [noise]\nTo board one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] I guess basically got up on a on the back and they started yelling and screaming about how giant he was back in the U.S [noise] and uh [noise]\nI think actually right after that I might have gotten us fought back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter] and uh\nI guess that really struck a chord had heard that was\nPretty amazing\n\nThey bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good uh you know start me thinking along [laughter] killer pat\n\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over campus and that set in both pretty high end nine feet tall the giant in eight pm Klein\nScott had no idea who put them up\nIt's added he would go to the cloud to specify time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in costumes for the giant\nHe gave giant man a booming boy\nPardon me no exactly with something like oh I'm trying to ... you know loud but just kind of weird [noise] you know sort of suggesting enough [laughter] you know I don't know\n\nGot asked his tall his friend hold on to access giant men's legs\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln to wrap around the middle of the high Toto\nAnd a black really way like the guys can't\nWe picked up a point in the bushes put on at I um [noise]\nWe really couldn't see what was going on out of the ... and so that hot day but I got on the shoulder of by the way up to their bike around my waist and we walked out and I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people for people try and I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was\nThe other is like\nA handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all coming to work for it right like you know what the what the hell am I doing here",
