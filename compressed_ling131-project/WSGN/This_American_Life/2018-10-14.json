{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WSGN", "content": "It's a school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into their building and a week and a half before school started after a bunch of training they're running their first drill and the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes\n[noise] [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district in rural Ohio they let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe date people on this team only two teachers volunteered for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team ... pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw the ride a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're gonna play tape of this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire\nTrouble getting into the sea so you had to put your finger on the sensor or do something\nAnd a little tricky\n\n[noise]\n[noise] there's a sheriff's deputy he's playing to shoot [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's the principal for grade six to twelve he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one of\nThese shootings another kid getting killed not enough of this way [noise]\nI'll marry witnessing the elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's locked this happens automatically when the school goes into locked down\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nNow driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nI sure do [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just timing the response\nWasn't great that was the turning in their first yeah oh yeah it was it was on the doors [noise]\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to though\nI I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even though he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThen he came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force mhm so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and start learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd one exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise] because they're finding is there's a possibility of somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nI Can't let it be me who hurts a student at my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed\nBut these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\n\nThese shootings do just continue to happen [noise]\nDid they not presently have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks a pass to display the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can\nAnd it's still not enough\nTo we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nFrom WBEZ in Chicago it's this American Life America last\nLike one ... will never be\nPrinting school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example whether that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than the work day and I mean they knew what to do with me what to do and and even still even with that and we still had\nCats are the people that aren't going to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what about producers Robin ... went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for every this is what occurred black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kids might have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were ... silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy\nTheir on an alternating schedule [noise]\nAnd the school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors of paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nIn that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing are cool but she did\nActually remembers being trained with other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nThe audio is of the I Believe if I remember correctly it's at the front office and one of the ladies that called in with the shooter is outside the door and you can hear her like her voice drops and she's like he's right outside he's right outside and you can hear the the dispatch officer telling her you know don't move and be quiet\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing\nThere were terrified people reading and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that ...\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught\nYou can choose to follow the protocol follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency\nFolder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students into from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group is small enough to fitness applied cause that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones\nMelissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from\nA while in our one by we heard noises\nAnd so that we could kind of like eliminate the cause it without having the light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers said this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police's anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons\nDrawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooter saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up [noise]\nNo\nOne said told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong\nAnd my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs\nThe handle with two hands and pulls it closed 'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grazing she survived ... legal in the room next to Stacy used at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having\nA playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but\nOne of trauma kits with guys in every classroom\nAnd training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has said lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson research is what's effective and these drills at Xavier University and as a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best\nCheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like tapering over windows\nCheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAt all I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat bad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually occurs how she'd stood in the doorway grabbing of dozens of your students [noise] remember it was a break\nFrom her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with\nThis and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly\nHappened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training of Douglas was barricaded on your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against the classrooms\nI've done it and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull those kids in her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first [noise]\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school my daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school squatting hide but when I asked her what the journalists for she said\nI don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting hide because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nWhere I come down on us\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about Barrett heating\nAnd I want her to know about running and fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to reckon with\nAll want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOh one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about don't say codes ... like it is\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I was a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n\nIf you're at Douglas there are new Gates's new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits in every room [noise]\nFifteen campus monitors compared to five last year\nThree school resource officers instead of one and they already did a code red trail only this time there was no confusion about one it would be school called parents told all the students and teachers in advance\nAnd starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know and the violence is going on in this world goes away it's not going to change that because they're strictly drugs drugs doors are still able to do\nYou plan to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach\nTheir primary goal is to support\nChris ... believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake and he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face at a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shoving match was about to start until Sandy stepped in and broke it up I reached out to Joan through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous\nAfter the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about\nThey tell families to brace themselves\nOh Mm Mm Mm [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's prime called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just [noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire so my first thought was\nAnd he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went why isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that\nNight another Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked if they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown\nSandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces and he said that's what we looked like five months ago\nThat looked like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filled suicide there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from [noise]\nWhile they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to\nParents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents had lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moments that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child died and the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to them\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on which they want you to get back to normal light moment brothers should they should dream of shame as you were shouldn't you know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person on there will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes us informal support group even more crucial\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland on a kitten that store at\nAnd let them at their house their son's name was neck he was the captain the Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nThat said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting Mitch an ...\nPhone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set a police officer was giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital said she saw patient who match next description [noise]\nBy that evening the door it's still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to an area that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents\nAnd waited every time the phone rings you jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning you see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time\nAnd he hears screams from these rooms then their names were called out even walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we couldn't even find your son and you know and that whole thought that she was somewhere else\nOur house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at his injuries which did not\nOn a good says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas where I teach a swimmer swimmers perfect [noise] I think it meant that there was nothing on his face or has had like ... it was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his toss destroyed his heart and lungs are here to see him\nYes he left before because your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an air Fifteen just so gross I'm so horrible horrible and I think to see him and to see on his body where his injuries were were um\nMade me get it like he was so peaceful and he was not in pain and it made me have a better
