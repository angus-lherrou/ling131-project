Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do we see killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire Mira Jason Harris than devote Jon ... author and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble and processing that like the number one\nIs there a\nIs a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know\nWe have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police for an itself in the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right\nTo ban in his editors thought let's\nDo something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented both\nBurst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... ... men sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years\nOr so paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now for this involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing\nThen put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of the show that\nYou think you have sitting on this stuff and it's probably five thousand pages\nI have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\nSo a or B bay county book or a thon boys and beach uh all the way through the alphabet\nAnd you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents a eight hundred and thirty one shootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen\nSo he did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect wizard chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons and some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case huh we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that\nAbout a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nOff their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found us\nThe mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they\nWant the police to think as a weapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs\nThat you see once or twice a week but it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to Ben central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are\nBlack and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that is right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police\nThan if you're white southern tells much right now but the breakdown between the ...\nFor the same demographics and its without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far in present six ... he says one percent or more here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know\nBack to where we were in why we want to start this ask them they'll just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know they're all written in this ah employment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as the Cato Darryl police ... Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife at apartment to five five at all\nMore often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nSo we have on this table the the ... deaths\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people\nTo [noise]\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\n... guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics\nYou heard and today we're gonna bring you one of those stories\nAnd if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you about today but I'm not I guess we'll just turn it over to you now you're okay a sole they won yeah where was this place in\nI think there'll be by doing anything\n[noise] so after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale gotten their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this after every every event or for no just wanted to address the nose hairs and has been telling everyone about\nThis being a joke to her son Andrew died in ... fourteen\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning part of just coping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is a crystal gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the larger staged a certain point because it was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says the stage comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then I then went from the gym shop over to Christel House just [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the land and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal entered cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n[noise]\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together and [noise]\nDifferent summer's wildfire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing\nWe see each other bad on the couch you know um air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over in versus a foreigner sleeper up talking you know getting to know each other a ... or the vice over his shoulder thoughts like therapy for\nVicki is let me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add um sex Marlon Brando to and it was when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlin was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nWe usually the video that just came down to ...\nMiles\nMy house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nAnd then when\nWe came in he came right here\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden 'cause the guardian wants the investigators were from\nGoing in there I Am saying 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back here it's all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in your time to end his brings you right back here mhm yep\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nBecause sometimes we started ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find the best model what about let me\nA couple of women had their phones for\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who\nThree two one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back to put the cars\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing that with us because I Know\nYeah I Know yeah we haven't been I had\nIt was a set of grace I we used to go there once a week and I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's where it was about Fifteen minutes talk about this\nAt home I have to go there all the time of course yeah of course how could you not\nAnd you know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like it's a it's a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm and it's great you know about yeah like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man you share\nEverything like that are like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nI Will be I don't know if you're in the way I like going on and all of that it's a little what got us all wasted not\nHe take his chair holding my holidays I don't know\n[noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nYou are to me to repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nAnyone could imagine\nWas on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother I watched as mind\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount
