I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not believe a show that is about bleeping so we must that we've done is it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to mess it went on it yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon at so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [noise]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie\nMiller and what what are you calling the\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this they want to Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\n\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small peaceful protest turned out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot was triggered hordes knows when what would become a loud but we'll rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEO bart today playing defense and now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of those\nViolence against roe kingdom what we can say in what we can't save\nBy just like ... to ... we can see and what we can ... Mueller white kids in front of me\nOn the Internet [noise]\n\nIt prioritize or sensors speech that\nCongresswoman we don't think about what we're doing a censoring speech but there are ...\nWhat what what really grabbed me was [noise] was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documents it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and diet\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like what are these rules\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so ah let's start back or on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue\nStarted it all [noise]\nBecause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to just\nSo I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employee is one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early\nTo thousands seismic change this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice face now than a website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screen flag day to Facebook and\nLake meaning like I use their saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of\nAnd she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is user would flag a piece of\nContent and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard or what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler and um if it makes me feel bad take it down and so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture\nPop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[noise] rise up fight for the lights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically\nEnough through Facebook so to coincide with alive protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one day\nChanged their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nThe title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a scene and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for its policy on photos of women threatened leading their children in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in\nMiami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nSo the Internet is an interesting\nDr phil it was a media storm and eventually perhaps as a result of our group and our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules\nSo for example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team the twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define nudity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female genitalia and then visible female breast and then the question is well okay how much of a breast needs to be showing before it's Newt and the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially the nipple and Ariel law than that's nudity\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting infamy happening\nAnd not certain about the good work and [laughter] you know I I started by these you know she worked in but\nI mean like you just came out of there [noise]\nI Know you're lying in fact\nMost people wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's\nTotally fine you know I just go I ... I got\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike ... are headed we'll talk about what a lot of racialized\nWind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ... Danny\nKaye I just I just like a forty five ... every day it was just as much as ... which fight\nFive thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case yeah\nHe he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWhere they um it's too I think the ... X rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nThat we had to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people will cages injure our cherry like\n[noise]\n... year old girl I was having sex with an eight year old boy it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night or he\nCatch themselves thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were never specific like I said I couldn't watch those ... cases Clinton ... ... S C I was like okay I get I I had to wear exploding that was like no no I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had to I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that I it's it's a classic it's yes to\nA different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around\nPlaying cleanup yeah what a job well yes and and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorists propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that but yeah the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nOh but a\nMoving onto our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of well there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be jokes ... hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back and I think we should [noise] Hi\nThis is Jenny calling from Lima new radio lab and supported by transfer wise and online

oh why dive in mind that [noise]\nMy dad [laughter]\nAnyhow so about a year into this running bit a martial law drawn to Facebook but a ... instead of seeing her normal loose feed a there was this message that pops up\nIt says you posted something that discriminated along the lines of race gender or ethnicity group\nAnd so we removed that post\nAnd so I'm like what can I possibly opposed it I

remind you guys are they're just you're just tuning in this episode desk contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you you you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing and it gives me the kids in the room might wanna sit it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty ...\nHey Rhonda Maryland but by the break we had some breaking news uh otherwise they wouldn't cut you off so abruptly\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb [noise]\nRipped through the crowd near the finish line Boston there [noise]\nYou have sort of the dust begins to settle\nYour picks them up throws them in a wheelchair\nIn as they're pushing him through the sort of ash cloud says there's a photographer there any snaps a son\nAnd the photo shows that the runner in the cowboy hat in these two other people pushing this man who uh is faces Ashton from all of the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ... meanwhile\nSoon as it is still on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise] Facebook employees\nAre clustering around several desks staring at the computer screens watching the news ...\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage\nShelling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the\nPhoto published on line and it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise] motives going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together and sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which the media the receipts push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvement we made the guidelines for moments like this do which the other side shoots\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let them have common sense here like humans we know that this\nLike if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy how how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nIn other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally clear they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWords start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so um yeah that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher were but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap book for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now and news organizations friends' parents\nThere let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs and this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology in response for your conscience which made exactly of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamentally at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically soccer burg and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization\nWhy what would be the downside of the\nFacebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media Oregon\nAll of this is if you're you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy no give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or\nThat having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years now and are beat\nIs covering the drug war in doing so years back she noticed this strange phenomena it\nFirst caught my attention and early two thousand ten should be checking social media you know you're scrolling through your feet and you know you'd", "year": "2018", "show_name":
