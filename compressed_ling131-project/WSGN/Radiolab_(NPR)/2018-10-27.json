I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and today we have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um like my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa learning I'm all up\nIs that I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten\nYeah it it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started sure Jim Tracey\nMy name's Jim Tracy I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home\nFor him um I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men and a woman go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two tenths and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nTo campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle and yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got the\nOther campers all four of them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of kill before and I'll kill again [noise] um I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees and he started marching the kids off into the woods took him into the woods near Brooke pairs of two with him behind them\nAre the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at 'em and then the last one he tied\nSo after we had the four people died he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um they heard vomiting\nSounds [noise] and then they heard filled with boys\nGet really high and they knew something was happening something bad was happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing them risky with his back and I used to have been five times in the chest and when this\nOh all ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that the other two campers the ones who have gotten\nAway had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt in state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies and state police standing by\nThere was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower and through a roving patrols men\nArmed with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID eight\nThirty seven year old Robert De Niro Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape here seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC\nSo by Tuesday night when the people got panicked when you're all are well one of the doors are locked people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast that I'm aware that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so as a manhunt dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police follow elite that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer that day a conservation officer\nScare started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there\nBut but you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nThe\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there grilling him the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing\nBut you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor Lisa ... is the conflict\nBetween what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation and we are recording\nSo the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named\nFrank our money frankly each arm Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go forwards standing up for the the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting to state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected had a good reputation but\nLife you're strong\nThis guy is dangerous\nA love of the things are going to have\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headless self to his child he was sued the school\nAnd I talk to him out of it and then he had an automobile accident I represent about that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then we kept ... for\nA must see some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped his court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from\nThen we went up to the back door [noise] took of\nDriving that lady friends car to try to lose any details\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis may be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren ... street and the town to provide their of Mariah Tom's cause a father so that them a road that goes to the miners are what is your to the minds it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just you're very likely that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly the there were no leaves and all the trees were black and I'm Claire skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are ... and this is the only way they came in here\nSo that so here we are in our Sunday suits and here we go trudging choose for is looking for the case\n[noise]\nBut none of them were just looking around [noise]\nAnd then\nWe found this was her friend well\nYou see the air shaft there they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's\nGot a flashlight that he takes out and then those you hope\nWhole I could see or sneak the blue shoe a blue sneaker\n[noise] and and a leg I said to myself this which does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of your money back up\n\nEventually algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery workout headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls ... yeah that's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids\nWere the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took you know to keep your confidences over ... under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is\nUnder the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if people are already dead than you do the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy\nYou hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for that client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the agent of plant or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a\nThere's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course yes soon I knew Mr hawk from bowling because his du da da da da da da da da da da and they knew him from church June\nOne if you have to be and then a moon a few ... the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what is coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] Hi this is already from

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right where they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what uh what what's their next move well\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nThat take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some case yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison host so right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take a little\nWell that's kind of gross oh yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from ... perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police\nDetective McCabe and the district attorney arm in his office and when they met army ... search the briefcase was up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies I Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly puts two and two together and immediately\nThought hole there you're\nAbout Susan ... like these are the two girls that we're most concerned about we think\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job a ... I was a good lawyer ...\nSo art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good\nBody is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if\nPeople say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand up\nI agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\nBe\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me\nBut eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone\nCalls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to\nGo on the record okay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and Dell gee found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality and swift\nLaw schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes\nMaybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um that that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policemen at the time that we with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli the\nLawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nAnd he won a law professors law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct\nIs to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping\nTo talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess ah\n\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know when you don't have to but\nWell [noise] [noise] what can I say she was she did receive her degree past few months later I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where was it difficult for us\nAnd um [noise] and Danny what's her boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship to her and he graduated just fear before and so to live [noise] and I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat futures I had a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\n[laughter] it's so horrible room to be in the position\n[noise] let me relieve whose daughter you know would would accuses the four to protecting the person to kill or no justification you couldn't just a mother and my\nOnly expects them except but we're\n\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's OK\n\n\nOkay can you hear the echoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up the up the hill kind of bounce around um water I think it's\nGoing to keep her down in there dripping I Can't tell where it's drifting everything up here it's frozen solid sub sure what that is um I think I'm going to turn back ground [laughter]\nI Wish I'd prefer flowers or something\n[noise]\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "27"}
