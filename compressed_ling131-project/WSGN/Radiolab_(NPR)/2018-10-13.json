Y.\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt's time now to practice some very useful phrase is I'll say the first year repeat I remembered and together let's but yeah\nThis is radio lab today translation it's time to begin we'll have five experiments in translation trench creation\nLesson number one the best poem was by my mother got got up to the people they might not know you try [noise]\nHello [noise]\nHi there Hi that Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which has a a hugely influential book in certain circles\nThe because of an obsession of his which predates sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one I was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem a tiny little pop\nIt kind of sat right in the middle of the pay\nLike a long stint sausage vertical a free syllables per line so it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that I still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was a poet in the early Fifteen hundred at the court of queen and then he wrote a poem for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and\nShe had gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first\nYeah okay it's called a union done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak it can be a sec young lady\nMommy none of us who doesn't who ... who ... ... ... to be to the mall calculating onto from all the\n... the on the top ... to ... to ... about it all on boom for you to dwell on the bone and\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks and you know it was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads a poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years publishes\nHis [noise]\nThey become very popular and the\nPublisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nPopped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to say well here's the thing he says you've got this problem mommy none of them doesn't look\nIf you just focus on the words of basically just the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you said being sick like president ... piece of Iceland\nThey don't look so pale and you lose your lumps shaped held a you know it's sort of like get better here's to your good health ... to ... I mean young but just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted and us and and this is key for dug it also known as the bones form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know a BBC CD and uh the first line ... young is identical to the last line I mean you just sort of has the feel of a ...\nIt has the poets name in the middle of the poems loan to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per lawyer didn't ya yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long so all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this problem you know along the way even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast the onto the top ... like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed I had a lot of\nPossibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead of spurting blood in bed instead of burping\nIn your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their can in the dead of squirming in in the head of slurping sloppy and instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I sent cheer all the best\nYou're forced rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you are a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise help being near my sweet dear\nSo clear laws now Douglas Glenn all became Douglas and I I like the ones that will just jammed became bread though the bread and butter butter bread\nYeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concepts and the costs\nOn oh her just some people like just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough feeling like he hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent them home to one of the guys at translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough\nBob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob can you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank whoa in soft still regain health dress and fully off with Clement who calls very different in tone and really quite marvelous\nHe got the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is\nMuch more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient Rome but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number so that's just the lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a\nA than a message that is the message was get well which is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was the form that's what made that things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nailed it for him he ended up sending the palm out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard ... who's colleagues friends chicken D. I. decree a fine day even got his wife to do one daughter away from your cage and engage in brave flight\nSo you might flee the group that was all bird themed hope you scoop into ham apple jam and French ... running around from town to town saying hey I got a point where everybody want either related and I am a person of binges this began a been showing myself [laughter]\nAnd then ended up becoming a seven hundred page book filled with translations of this pump\nAhead and read out of the best one now this is that right right no that's not the best one it is that one on the opposite effect here we are OK okay this is also one of his but like the twenties when he did ...\n... ... ... from some dumb bug drag you down that friends feel the urge bugs for ...\nSmashed ... come you come you who lived to sheets as sweet let's to pop tart make your heart competing claims mandate sure hope God cures your body had defeat got serious [laughter]\nIt's humor yeah\nAlthough not the best he says oh I I I Do want to get to my mother's translate ads here where's my mother's was\nSomehow I'm going to have to look it up here where it was it just for a long complicated and see if we do\nThis one from his mommy says came along years after he started here it is and he thinks that might be the winner\n[noise] high to get well hospitals prison in prison ... well ... years though Columbus orders in a nutshell go pick out votes wide your mouth so sweet me going south\nBe threatening you to be a who is withdrawing a year with strong support and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about we have\nPreviously calls for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and that's a serious policy thank you all very very much\nAnd it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry no or this or this or\nOh yeah no I followed him out afterwards hey man [noise] um [noise] can you pronounce your name for me\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in his twenties he's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you listen what happened there and stuff like that some kind of cultural a guide me\nIs that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space is serious and I'm using a generally they say no are you going to not just speak are you\nGoing to do yeah this is as us exactly my point are you going to take sanctions maybe going the youngest son's yeah do you feel that that question for you at risk maybe who knows is that does the job description doing good journalism in Ethiopia\n[noise] makes so much thank you thank you for me from my numbers on there\nSo that conversation was about five months ago did you do know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether did he suffered for this question in any way no but I have his phone number so I can give them a call in and find out\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] and I and many exits Gregory Gregory Warner oh legally\nStrange calls to his home in some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nThat I started learning not to use a gun on together them and start itching and that uh\nThey said you should line up with the government's priority yeah these messages were from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism taskforce will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf you\nPut ... he's in the ...\nOut of the ones that are saying this kind of makes it\nAnd were they threatening yeah some\nOf them where you know some skiing gained a doctor I Would be punished according to the point is that our incomes and the lights come ...\nNewspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to lead in Nairobi to see a cute little nice HP leave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother and I ... in your your it's Washington\nOkay Washington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that ... what is your mom say she said please don't do that smoked gouda\nIt might be you know try to get can you do things like that you know my mom's side like that too yeah not like that yeah\n\n... or ...\nOr or you know\n...\nA ...\nEasy on a\nRadio lab will continue minimum ...

B. A. Jim dot org [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThank you for joining radio lab this afternoon on your NPR station\nId point three WBAI Jeb Birmingham am one oh four point five FM in Fort Paine\nRepublic radio for the heart of Alabama a public service of UAB and were supported by our members\nDamn ... this is radio lab today [noise] five experiments in translation\nLet's from number three recalled its shell shocked move out of the ... not discovered a sure would choke now you're try\nThis one or Robert Krulwich and our producers Owen we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin was George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedians are from the community [noise]\nAnd it's like saying is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time\nOh this is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions and all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he thought from schooling and one of\nNext favorite curling Russian I really like this one is about how Carlin hated [noise]\nIn English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality and\nCarlin was wonderful about things like that was about both\nAs he called and we I've known\nPeople in this country no morals people we shift them all away and we brought in these senior\nCitizen\nAnd he was the reason we use the if\nIt's just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in\nIntensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught we just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely ill means he's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it it does our\nReactions to it that actually have like I have a negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked\nSimple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked\nAnd then it became battle for the battle fatigue for syllables now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhausted [noise]\nHey we're up to age syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as the\nPost traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you bland it out the words so if you stop saying no yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some\nFor some interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying is that like now that his PATS Steve we're not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nShell shocked I'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at that time\n[noise]\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI hardly ever notice other people walking around me I feel like\nI can always hear the topic and it's on the topic but not as if he for\nWhich he says when she put the device on and put those sensor undertone [noise] the sidewalk\nCame alive at night it was amazing like I did\nWell there again\nWhich you describe them in a way it sounded\nAlmost like a pain to\nReally soft last chance it everything that I saw I saw flashes\nBelieving that can move\nThere is walking and I can see their last living and I can see them again but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see their teachers or whether they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt\nAddress or pass a just like see their shot at this and every now and and I see the light counted on really yeah\n\nI imagine some L like underwater creatures\nUh-huh squishy jelly fish like yeah\nYeah like lady yeah\nYeah like that [noise]\nIn that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue New York city becomes is a cheesy sea of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting while using the brain work and you can check that out by going to radio abduct

point five FM\nAnd Ford pay a public service of UAB and supported by our members stay with us this afternoon coming up next we have on the media and later on this evening on all things considered\nWeekend edition and jet up I'm Ron I'm Robert ... radio lab and today experiments in translation [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLesson number five how does it make the riders old without a ride ... motivate should your ... or ... ... ... ... you know you try\nYou guys mind if in the remaining few minutes we're going on an army fishing expedition sure sure it's the here's here's the here's our quandary girl okay religious enjoys you were doing Sean ... okay so recently we sat down with uh\nAre in a game of the end because here's why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter] got his I got a little insistence liberal and just in a cause you were like are innate we've got to learn it yes I said that are and I'm like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do our name and I was like but is there a story and you know\nNo I didn't say that I just said that that uh that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as\nOften happens you or me down as I find let's just try it and they'll say you know so when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town and I think your your son was getting married yes he was and ah her I was doing like tech team work for me [laughter]\nOkay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence\nIn DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins ... mhm [noise] right and the discovery of this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure\nReally yeah it was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's the quick story so what happened was\nOkay so just to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when you're born you get half\nYour DNA from your mom half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T. C. N. G. that's it but he's the problems we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy team piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from proteins yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of proteins so the question was like how how does all that get generated like\nHow did this for simple base has become the Indian assets to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us\nUs how do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ...\n[noise] this is a code problem\nThought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases\nThink of a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Gigi ... if you if you take one and then out comes the protein what what's simple code could I Do to do that\nAnd just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out to side I think\nThat ourselves read our genes three bases at a time [noise]\nLike instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe it's a TA CJ DCA AC a G ...\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triples not pairs [noise] 'cause if you have a sense of three or rather than to game I figured well that'll give mathematically would give me more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins yep\nNow this is just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick\nAnd a group of other scientists worked at all out\nThey they figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into proteins\nHere's how it works and sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting there\n... set of molecules come along and ... and ... copy of\nThis copies now made of our energy which is like DNA very similar and still in the basic sort of four letter format but it's now in the move 'cause pedals over to this big old factory in the cell called the ... so [noise]", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "13"}
