a bold and faced an excruciating decision she was thirty three she wasn't married and had no children which was considering a hysterectomy because of decades of health issues that decision in the subsequent surgery became a theme for her latest collection of poems called\nHouse is an enigma she spoke to me and explained how the idea of a house developed my doctors kept\nThis language of house they kept saying things like we're not sure that your body would be able to house a fetus we're not sure that you can you'll be able to have a child because we don't know if if your body would be a good house for it you know I'm facing the biggest the most difficult decision of my life and\nNot only did I feel like I couldn't publicly talk about it I started realizing you know my doctors aren't even using the right kind of language they're not even speaking about this directly they're using a metaphor and it really made me angry\nAnd as I was driving between doctors' offices in my house I kept noticing this one house that just looked really really angry itself\nAnd it started thinking about how houses themselves must be pretty angry that we use them as metaphors for everything started to realize that houses me that's my body and all of this is about how angry I felt about the fact that I was going through something that was so intense\nAnd not only could I not talk about it publicly but my doctors who are the people who were supposed to be their guide\nA house is the word my doctor used my body would you mind reading it now for all\nMy doctors couldn't make themselves tell me that I couldn't have children until they made me into a metaphor into a house happy and the kind of story they tell their own children\nAnd then the story I became the house I was cried I was the house who felt her facade hot and nodded and wet\nHouse had forgotten her Kleenex and house and I stay the space that didn't become a place house is not a synonym for nest house is not an end to them for full\nHouse is a part without speech house is nobody's property\nHouses the emptiness that can't be addressed in any way that feels like a home house does not want to talk about it I'm as big as a house houses pregnant friends says\nHouses mouth makes itself smile makes itself into the door that I Will never open I Will never close\nWith a different plane around with those words on a page versus the conversations have with family members or friends around these issues\nOh absolutely like as you can probably tell it's even difficult now or five years later to talk about it openly 'cause I think what drove me to the page and particularly to this form because it gave me a kind of code some of my best friends didn't even know about it\nActually now that you've asked me that very good question I realize that their family members of mine who don't know about it it was that quiet to me so I was able to be allowed about it on the page but I was completely silent and secretive about it in real life\nOne of the words that shows up in several titles of other problems in the collections melancholy which makes sense given the sort of issues you're dealing with 'em but only changes to your body but the idea of for go in the chance to have children um how did you explore the idea of loss\nYeah and it's a weird last right because it's a ... as a loss It's MORNING something that never existed I think that the way that we deal with loss particularly in this culture\nThere's kind of this idea that you'll you'll come to a point where you're accept this and you'll get over it you'll be able to to move on there's a kind of a repetition and the book and in a way that was means cycling through\nMy loss and my feelings of sadness and thinking okay well when I get to the end of the series I'm going to finally accepted\nThen that would get to the end of the series or the end of a certain time after I had surgery and be like yeah no stone [laughter]\nStill not over it um so I think that one of the things that happened in the book\nIs it gave me permission to keep\nMorning and to accept the fact that being this is something that even though it's something that never really existed it's still something\nThat won't go away was collections now together it's now out there how do you imagine people reading those what are you willing to take away from it given that it is so intense and so personal I think that I wanted to give them language to\nThe kinds of experiences that women rarely talk about\nAnd the kind of introspection that I think is necessary\nTo I suppose find a life that you really want rather than the life that other people tell you you should want\nMaybe there's somebody out here that's experiencing what I experienced and if they pick up\nThis book

was thirty three she wasn't married and had no children but she was considering a hysterectomy because of decades of health issues that decision and the subsequent surgery became a theme for her latest collection of poems called house is an enigma\nShe spoke with me and explained how the idea of a house developed my doctors kept\nThis language of house they kept saying things that we're not sure that your body would be able to house a fetus we're not sure that you can you'll be able to have a child because we don't know if it's your body would\nIf and not only did I feel like I couldn't publicly talk about it I started realizing you know my doctors aren't even using the right kind of language they're not even speaking about this directly they're using a metaphor and it really made me angry\nAnd as I was driving between doctors' offices in my house I kept noticing this one house that just looked really really angry itself\nHas started thinking about how houses themselves must be\nPretty angry that we use them as metaphors for everything started to realize that houses me that's my body and all of this is about how angry I felt about the fact that I was going through something that was so intense\nAnd not only could I not talk about it publicly but my doctors who are the people who were supposed to be their guiding me through this decision they wouldn't even talk about it straight\nOr one of the poems it's in this collection is a house is the word my doctor used my body would you my ...\nMy doctors couldn't make themselves tell me that I couldn't have children until they made me into a metaphor into a house happy and the kind of story they tell their own children\nAnd then the story I became the house I was cried I was the house who felt her facade hot and nodded and wet\nHouse had forgotten her Kleenex and house and I stay the space that didn't become a place house is not a synonym for nest house is not an answer them for full\nHouse is a part without speech house is nobody's property\nHouses the emptiness that can't be addressed in any way that feels like a home how ... does not want to talk about it I'm as big as a house houses pregnant friends says\nHouses mouse makes itself smile makes itself into the door that I Will never open I Will never close\nWith a different playing around with those words on a page versus the conversations have

best friends didn't even know about it\nActually now that you've asked me not very good question I realize that their family members of mine who don't know about it it was that quiet and to me so I was able to be allowed about it on the page but I was completely silent and secretive about it in real life\nOne of the words that shows up a several titles of other problems in the collections melancholy which makes sense given the sort of issues you're dealing with 'em but only changes to your body but the idea of for go in the trip to have children um how did you explore the idea of loss\nYet and it's a weird last right because it's ... it's a loss It's MORNING something that never existed I think that the way that we deal with loss particularly in this culture\nIs strange and not applicable to my situation at all because there's kind of this idea that you'll you'll come to a point where you're except this and you'll get over it you'll be able to to move on there's a kind of a repetition and the book\nAnd in a way that was means cycling through my loss and my feelings of sadness and thinking okay well when I get to the end of the series I'm going to finally accepted\nThen that would get to the end of the series or the end of a certain time after I had surgery and be like yeah no stone [laughter]\nStill not over it um so I think that one of the things that happened in the book is it gave\nMe permission to keep\nMorning and to accept the fact that being this is something that even though it's something that never really existed it's still something\nThat won't go away was collections melt together it's now out there how do you measure people reading those when he wanted to take away from it given that it is so intense and so personally
