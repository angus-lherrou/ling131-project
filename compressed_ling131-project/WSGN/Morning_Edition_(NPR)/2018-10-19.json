officials dead including a top\nPolice chiefs Pamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend one of the original plan what's at stake and most of the\nCampaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have um a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors uh and philosophies\nAh there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry partly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true\nAwe and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud so you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of of worry a and and and anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province really large important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different a week\nRight and we don't know that obviously this is a a measure of taken on an emergency basis um just to to sort of calm things down and I'm In kind of hard to very large province with this stuff last\nIt's the least have its intelligence chase and at the governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would think and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots and lots of voters um but let's let's see what happens tomorrow um let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking or they're going to be taking famous

you you're unemployed rate low uh-huh\nAnd um\nStock market in Brooklyn in Greece and so the economy is important to you yeah\nAnd this is this is um I open it [laughter] [laughter]\nI didn't realize how he he thought of trying to see how they talked about that is the first time yeah\nCivil society we grow up knowing how on democratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe would be in a situation where we have a president that basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMenu of all I like all go call your dad do you all about you know there are\nSome time for us to talk about what the ... but they don't care about it through the you're just has to CNN events drum riff off to both him\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it and I don't know if you're does\nHave an el ... defend a law I think it'll apple I'm Trump boxes like trying to you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think do you think the media is too negative about Trump\nIt's not fair to say that Russia interfered in through the election this country mhm but when they know that\nWas it or I shouldn't before the election [noise] the way until drum both elected and the money issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with yeah the Russians where that would that bother you yeah you don't mind you don't believe that yeah [laughter]\nThey're doomed proven that don't need to believe them\nYou know through the bottom ie the FBI ... no ... job no no all he believes that\nThe Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah to some of your ground yeah there are a lot of families who've been divided over their views of from what you hear like dinner conversations that yeah the go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one percent\nAnd ... I mean I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here say that we can have the freedom to have different views to have this kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular ratio that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody\nGot to go to vote yes you would fall choice and for future with thinking stupid everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention any he ... after the war he was\nA political prisoner for a ... a two year three years he was held in a political concentration camp I Know they\nThey do a re education to get him\nYeah we're the communist tries to you know basically get him to change his thinking\nIt is powerful to hear you say that people should\nVote coming from mhm\nThe history that you have yeah I just think we need to protect our democracy\nDo water bowl we would drummer right because if we were wrong\nAnd that time we make it dry how we have another ... ...\nThat was ... and her father couch trend there to voters here in orange County California and we're going to take it to other corners of this district elsewhere on the program this morning this is NPR News this is your NPR station\nNow do you point three WBAI gym for me I'm On the radio for the heart of Alabama [noise]\nMorning I'm Andrew Yeager it's friday October Nineteen [noise]\nFrom NPR News It's MORNING edition [noise]\nComing up Mexican riot police regarding the southern border with what a ... to prevent HUD during the migrants from crossing the border into Mexico [noise]\nThe latest part of a caravan of Central Americans trying to make their way to the United states details on that about Fifteen minutes on WBAL gym [noise]\nCost them is twenty two years old and a recent graduate of the University of Florida\nShe landed in Israel at the beginning of the month for a master's program and human rights at an Israeli university but authorities at the airport denied her entry under twenty Seventeen law banning activists affiliated with the pro Palestinian campaign to boycott Israel\nAll costs them used to have a small chapter of a pro boycott student group but\nNow she says she no longer supports the boycott she was\nEngine following several other cases of Israel detaining left wing critics at the airport and border and it caused some embarrassment in Israel\nAnd I asked him about what you're saying that\nDeputy foreign minister cp ... belly told Israeli radio last week that Israel's ban on all costs him was not very successful she said Israel should reconsider how it applies at century ban when it turns into an international issue we lose more than we when she said\nBut Israeli strategic affairs minister ... who led Israel's campaign to ban all costs them defended them of bringing to the little guy and\nHe said don't just look at articles in the New York times and the media is critical of Israel he argued there are thousands of pro Israel students in the U.S who contend with pro Palestinian activists on campus who will support our move without cost them\nProponents of the boycott divest meant and sanctions movement say there peacefully protesting Israel's treatment the Palestinians but Israeli leaders have called it a campaign to undermine Israel's legitimacy as a country\nLaura customs case reached Israel Supreme Court which ruled that costs them had not been involved in boycott activities for more than a year and had demonstrated an academic curiosity about Israel she was released from the airport yesterday ... before is her lawyer\nIt's a victory for free speech academic freedom and there were a large case troops that thought policing had absolutely no place in a democracy\nA right wing Israeli activist group said it would be closely monitoring all costs him during her time in Israel to ensure she did not promote a boycott the Hebrew University of Jerusalem which is supported al ... case in court said it looked forward to having her on campus next week Daniel Estrin NPR News Jerusalem\nThis is NPR News\n[noise]\nThanks to listening to your NPR station Ninety point three WBAI Jim Birmingham public radio for the heart of Alabama what I mean up the Nineteen Seventy Halloween movie was directed by John Carpenter who also composed it's creepy middle was score story about\nThat one about ten minutes on that would you be Asia [noise]\nWhat's\nAnd this community if all workplace issues on line at butler dot com [noise] ooh\n\nMostly sunny today was highs of Seventy eight degrees\nMostly coffee tonight there's a chance of rain loads of sixty six ... chance of rain to the morning eyes around sixty eight\nFifty nine at U.
