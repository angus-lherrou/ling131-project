the truck with us and he's just screaming screaming I don't understand what you're saying so that's when I realized oh here we go into something big happening\nFor the next year after the explosion he was in and out of trouble small infractions which he chalked up to the amount of medication prescribe for his head injuries and the TST then while on leave he was caught with a small amount of cocaine

like owning struggle with service related trauma it's a group with a high suicide rate\nTo address that the VA last summer's started a new program this group of veterans can come into the VA and be treated for mental health issues at least for Ninety Days\nWe asked the VA how many people use the program and the first year the agency gave us speak you're showing that nationally one hundred and Fifteen veterans did a fraction of the veterans who would now qualify for mental health care twenty five of those patients were in San Diego Dr Neal ... is with the San Diego VA\nThey came in and saying that they had an urgent need and and they were evaluated and received care for for that urgent need whether it was a substance use disorder or and suicidal thoughts\nVeterans advocates are disappointed that just one hundred and Fifteen people took advantage of the program when the VA says there at least five hundred thousand veterans with other than honorable discharges Christopher Goldsmith is an Iraq vet who works with the Vietnam veterans of America\nNot possible that that the number of people who need no it's a failure to contact them to fully on them\nOther than honorable discharges executive director Rick weidman says the da just simply didn't promote the program\nIt's a program that most people who are eligible for it don't know about and the reason for that is that be a refused to do any outreach\nDr Quito Franklin heads the VA suicide prevention programs she said the VA tried to get the word out through veterans' organizations\nWe rode out rather quickly and

Murphy of Connecticut was able to push through legislation that will require the VA to treat vets with other than honorable discharges Murphy says as long as their mental health issues are related to their service\nIf you have the TST man because of the patriots day you act couch you should not lose eligibility for your veterans' benefits or that's what's been happening\nThe new law also ends the Ninety day cap which some veterans advocates say made the program even harder to navigate and it requires the da to seek out people who qualify\nThat means service members leaving now but also hundreds of thousands who left with less than an honorable discharges in the past finding those veterans will be tough\nI felt shot I still feel Sean\nAfter years of being rejected Josh owned and is now getting his pie TST treatment paid for by the VA he says it's been a lifesaver but he fears other veterans have already given up\nI wouldn't be surprised that most of them aren't alive and the reason why I say that is without treatment without proper care even loved ones like I don't think I could do without God and my family I tell her to have done with that I don't want to do anymore\nMurphy's legislation gave the VA one hundred and eighty days to set up its outreach program that deadline has already passed in a written statement the VA says it is quote writing

he's the writer who disappeared after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish officials say the Saudi Government murdered him but President Trump says the U.S needs more evidence before holding the Saudis responsible\nWe've asked for if it exists for his own little notes on not sure yet that it exists probably does possibly the\nTurkish media reported the existence of a recording yesterday it allegedly captured the last moments of ... life\nFor Saudi Arabia to be held accountable Senator Chris Murphy is one of him he's a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Foreign Relations committee to morning senator morning do you feel certain that you know what happened to ...\nI I don't know that without the evidence that the Turks reportedly have I can say\nThat I feel ... and um but uh I have seen no evidence and I've seen the classified information available to members of Congress to suggest the show is alive or everything that I have seen 'em that's both publicly available and privately available\nThat leads me to believe that the Saudis did ah unfortunately murder to show inside that conflict\nSo then how does the U.S hold Saudi Arabia accountable at this point specific place\nOr the first thing we've asked is for the president\nA under a piece of legislation called the Magnitsky Act or to do its own investigation and who's responsible and a sanction individuals with it believed order a this execution and so that process is under way the president is required by law to report to us on\nHis mind and ah but Congress can't act on its own and I I Would argue that we should take the step of removing the United states from a military coalition with the salaries\nOf that is currently bombing of the country of Yemen resulting in thousands of civilian deaths inside that country and the reason that I think that these two should be linked is because\nThe United states is partnering with Saudi Arabia because we believe the salaries when they tell us that they are not intentionally killing civilians\nYeah and you're ready for it you want more ah I hear it all the time people saying you know people love a pod

story for NPR's Planet money podcast\nA big part of ... job at the consumer financial Protection Bureau was looking into borrower complaints and in the spring of twenty Seventeen he and his team noticed this weird pattern\nWe see cops firefighters teachers nurses who are entitled to public service loan forgiveness and they are repeatedly denied\nThe public service loan forgiveness program began in two thousand seven was a pretty simple pitch spent ten years in one of those public service jobs paying down your student loans and the government would forgive whatever's left as a thank you\nBut last year from an was hearing from lots of public servants who said they made it years into the program\nAnd found out their plan for financial freedom essentially just wiped out in the blink of an eye because of the mistakes of their student loan company\nHere's what was happening from and says the federal government pays a bunch of companies to manage more than forty million student borrowers\nThese companies are called servicers and they handle the paperwork and answer the phones when borrowers call and ask for help and they're doing a terrible job Massachusetts attorney general more ... is actually suing one of these servicers fed loan I spoke with her\nEarlier this year their failure to do their job has resulted in hundreds of thousands of students having their financial future sabotage\nAnd several other states are suing the different service or ... claiming it's made mistakes too and broken the law\nWhen when the rules set out for them by Congress and the education department and that they're doing their best they say to resolve bar were complaints neither company wanted to talk for this story you know who did the students who thought they were going to get their loans forgiven\nBut aren't I made life decisions based on wrong information\nSarah crane says her service or told her she qualified for a loan forgiveness she's teaching now has been in public service for six years and thought she had just four to go\nBut recently she called the ed department and someone told her oh I'm Sorry but you don't qualify not until you consolidate your loans\nBut she was told if she does that her count down to forgiveness would reset back to ten years\nI can kind of let my guard down and said he had this kind of sucks and she said yeah it really sucks [laughter] twenty\nNine thousand applications for public service loan forgiveness have been process so far and other those Ninety nine percent have been denied in other words syrup ... story is not unusual\nOh well see that's actually a huge relief because I Walk around with an enormous amount of feeling silly [laughter]\nIn its defense the education department says everybody who is eligible is being approved and they say they're working on improving the process\nBut ... a former student loan watchdog says the department under President Trump isn't only walking away from the fight\nTo help student loan borrowers they're actually arming the other side in response to all those state law suits against it servicers the Trump Administration is now arguing these companies they're protected from state laws because they work for the federal government\nIn this fight is now being waged in the courts\nMeanwhile Seth fraud men may have left government but he continues to wage his fight for
