EDITION from NPR News good morning I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Noel King until recently the head of Interpol the international police organization based in France was a man named among Hong way he's from China but in a stunning move China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol\nI talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about a month or month\nAway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he\nBecame the first Chinese had of Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt would a scape China\nAs it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\n[noise] what China's government has been released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife grace among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nights suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported him missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own France where in trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nWe had to go in and you know when I'm speaking on behalf of might have and when my children on them for my mother and all the wives\nAnd children's husbands and fathers so that they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's a crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police\nWell when she talks about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government's anti corruption campaign was launched by paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and its neared hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julia ... conga highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rule China he was trying to secure\nThe of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol\nWell even before this happened China's use of it or fall under amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted to issue a red notice that's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists readers are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money as that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead to face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff Jeff standard likes that system he's in Lewis ten in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on some of their stuff we're going to be half of war or taking and their belts are going to be chained together so you're walking on the line it's kind of like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nNow we can take them right in the back put it in front of a video camera the judge has access to the video camera on the conversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning when I first\nFrom ... to see you\nSir no sir you know you couldn't ... Davidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh sure there's plenty to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\nWhere Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate even before\nThe proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase spell amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News this is your NPR station study point three ...
