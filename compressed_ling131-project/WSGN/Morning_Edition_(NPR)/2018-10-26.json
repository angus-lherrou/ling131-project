Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nThere was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and who doesn't want to and she wants to look like Diane around for one day I I don't know how like that got races on hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David\n... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to\nTell us about her history of making racialized comments\n[noise] well these aren't uh the only examples or are there are number I remember back in twenty or the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period are focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal or strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously\nOr one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the ... a former LA up a homicide detective markets farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about uh the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as as discredited thinks she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she thought was the acceptability a black\nYeah NBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nThe only African American anchor yeah uh uh of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuser foul balls at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular colleagues and that her reading some cells were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there uh because uh\nShe needed to get out of that show now the show is gone and she's a

hard to escape the suspicion that the critics you say he\nShot every I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where a Jewish finance is a portrayed as the shadowy if it goes through manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition\n[noise] well what do people in his native hungry thinkers Soros\nHe was a hero early on in the transition away
