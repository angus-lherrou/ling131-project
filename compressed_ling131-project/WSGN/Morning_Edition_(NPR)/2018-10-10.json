welcome senator\nThank you David good morning so you are one of only four senators to oppose Nikki Haley's um confirmation yesterday you said that she has helped move U.S interests forward at the United nations what does change your mind about her well I voted against\n'em then governor Nikki Haley because she had very little virtually no foreign policy experience\nAh and she did not impress me and her confirmation hearing is having the relevant experience to be our lead spokes person at the United nations I after watching her performance and engaging with her regularly over several months\nI actually called her and said I'd made an I'd made a mistake that I thought on human rights and an standing up to Russia She was a bright spot in the Trump administration's foreign policy team\nOf course I disagree with a number of the things that Trump Administration has done in foreign policy and she did carry forward a number of the president's America First initiatives at the un ah but she ended up being a much more forceful voice on American values in particular human rights than I initially had expected\nAcknowledging that you made a mistake does that cause you to approach the

retired minister who lives with his mother in east Nashville, Tennessee he says his medical saga began a decade ago\nIn two thousand eight hours when in because I was playing tennis with the un ab fab euro and uh he\nBeat mob but and so I wanted fresh nice to help me sleep\nBut after that routine knee surgery Lankford developed a learning\nIt's called blood poisoning and all he remembers from his delirious weeks in the hospital was near death experience and I saw green grass or somehow on the other side of a river\nIt looks like there was no lodge a larger profit who's miracles included resurrection of the dead his mother leader says at one point hospital staff were so sure he would die overnight they didn't even bother to pass on his medical chart to the day shift\nThe thing that's amazing is his talking to us and his like being aware of what we were saying and yet then not knowing and not remembering any of that for I Would say it ... we were at the rehab are bad for weeks\nNow a decade later Richard Langford says he's still struggling to work its way out of a ticket that's physical emotional and cognitive though he's still reached the New Yorker and remains active in

able to have a good conversation they can't balance a checkbook they can't find the names of people\nThis form of dementia is\nIt per minute it's permanent\nIn some we've been following people for over ten years now from the brain ICU study which we didn't hear at Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out still have elements of the dementia\nOverall he estimates that a third improve a third stay the same and the third end up on a slow decline for many the mental damages akin to a traumatic brain injury ... or even sometimes are farmers itself\nThese problems are linked to the degree of leery um people experience well in the ICU ... says\nEvery day you're delirious you have about thirty five percent increased risk of this dimension so if you do the math on that three days of ... you got a almost a sure thing that you're going to have some elements of the dementia\nHe can't say exactly why delivery of leads to dementia but ... has develop strategies to sharply reduce delivery him in his

foundation at ISI ... foundation dot org\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin in the Nineteen thirties a New York prosecutor brought down lucky she on now than it tore as head of the New York mafia\nIt made the prosecutor Thomas Dewey a household name and set him up for a career and politics less remembered as the staff lawyer who made it possible an African American woman named Eunice Carter\nAnd her story is the subject of a new book that is called invisible the forgotten story of the black woman lawyer who took down America's most powerful mobster it's by her grandson the law professor and prolific writer Stephen Carter who told Steve Inskeep that he knew his grandmother growing up it was never told about her accomplishments she did all these\nThings she was a prosecutor for years she was a big power in the public in politics for a long time and yes I grew up without knowing any of that but knowing it now I think the story is quite a remarkable and\nI Want to underline that named Thomas Stewart people know it because of the famous false headlined Dewey defeats Truman he was a presidential candidate who was supposed to win in Nineteen forty eight and last\nBut before that was a noted prosecutor in New York City what was the task was set to in the Nineteen thirties\nSo Nineteen forty five New York experienced what the press called the runaway grand jury when a local grand jury refused to work anymore the corrupt the district attorney's office would just make no effort to break up organized crime\nSo the governor of New York for the New York has to be attorney to choose a special prosecutor ended up being Thomas Dewey and his job was to clean up organized crime in New York\nBy hiring people who've never been prosecutors who'd never been involved with the prosecutor's office which is seen as entirely corrupt so we hired ... what he called the twenty against the underworld Nineteen white men plus one black woman Eunice quarter\nNo matter how many pages of your book I read it still seems somehow a little surprising to be in a time\nThat that she got hired by this white prosecutor how'd that happen\nWe don't know exactly why you're hired her but higher her he did the downside was that after do we hired her he set about again trying to investigate ... but do we wanted to investigate it for murder\nOr some ... what he considered a serious crime but at the same time the only woman and only black person on his staff my grandmother Eunice or do we assigned to look into prostitution even though he made clear that he had no intention\nOf prosecuting Louisiana for prostitution because do he said he was not going to be a moral crusader\nWhile and Eunice Carter faces the task along with these other lawyers have tried to find some way to work her way up to the top man to lucky Louisiana where did she began\nSo after Eunice was hired\nA she was banished in a sense to the furthest cubicle in this special office do we had a set up and when do we asked citizens of New York to come in and talked about organized crime in their neighborhoods turned out that most of the letters and complaints were about prostitution\nAll these mice are coming in they had to be dumped on somebody's desk and they're all dumped on union says there's a sense in which she was sidelined during the investigation\nBut she didn't want to hold her back in fact from the beginning she went over to the attack she actually put together the first evidence anyone had ever had that the mob was involved in prostitution because there was an article of faith among the police\nThat prostitution was run by small time operators and certainly the mafia was not involved Eunice set herself the task of proven otherwise and against considerable opposition including in her own office she succeeded in improving it\nI guess the method here as you start at the bottom work your way up\nLike that once she began together the evidence she persuaded do we go to a range of police raids which ... was in charge of\nOn eighty a bravo one night they brought in the prostitutes the women who worked in these ... was there was a reason they arrested only the women because the women were accustomed being bailed out by these men called the fixers but the rest of the fixtures too there was no one to bail them out", "show_name":
