investigators trying to determine that the states\nWill surely the key is trying to ... obviously ... by the perpetrator or the the individuals who are responsible for male and the devices\nAnd they're really looking at it from a two perspectives one is the forensics that is involved in each of the devices and the fact that there are multiple devices is actually very helpful to the investigators\nBecause they can compare and contrast and and just get a a richer picture if you will of that forensic data set\nAnd so that includes things like is there are their fingerprints is their DNA or the hair and fiber just different things that the\nThe experts will look at the other aspect is the intelligence part of it and that really has two parts also when the was there prior intelligence meaning prior reports about people threatening any of these individuals\nAnd of course the secret service has a lead on that as a way to protect these a former presidents and such\nAnd

I'm David Greene\nAnd I'm Noel King markets in Asia where mostly down over night after a bad day on Wall street yesterday the Dow fell more than six hundred points\nToday Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang saying index in Hong Kong flipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYour morning while I was thirty percent drop for China's stock markets sounds pretty darn bad what's going on\n[noise] we'll try this kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U. S. much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nBut what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a child doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump has imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the ...\nDeep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy in my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all\nOf their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes\nBlocks chain that technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he can help mitigate climate change in all sorts\nOf land use agriculture\nPurpose oils frustration\nOur sometime in coaches the climate change coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about ... [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references or larger ecosystem of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like ... ... is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems\nLove this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment now the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that fix climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute because I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company has planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine rock and a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the stations that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something is solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from

Republicans\nHave taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten this far more votes overall the redistricting proposal would

proposal show it's been gaining popularity over the last few weeks but it's still a difficult subject to get people excited about Chiquita Hannah of Detroit plans to vote in November and she's leaning

for college basketball the whole what happened yesterday\nYou know I'm not sure it means anything for college basketball I'm a ... in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on\nIn a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money from a one source um to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years\nIs that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nTo Nike or those those uh operations have gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money\nSo the the surprise here is that it has been criminal lives\nOr by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years and it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from\nThe NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow actually go ... which is which is a step\n... now you could possibly

you see the same way that she does I\nI don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the euro universes were being the fraud it um by this system ah because by\nFunneling this money um two players are are players families\nUm these people knew that they were making these players in eligible under NC double a rules and therefore that at some point it would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the university has given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud at the universities of um

S.

...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment now the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that fix climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute because I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where

college basketball's a whole what happened yesterday\nI'm not sure it means anything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money from a one source um to the families of talent\nUm to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nUm to help transfer that money so that the surprise here is that in his men criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from\nThe NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling money

and all of this do you see at the same way that she does I\nI don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by this system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible\nUnder ... double A. rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd
