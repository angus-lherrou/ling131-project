Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand

hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw him on a grand embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it the for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to a ... there\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so is ...\nCustomary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars

display the ten commandments same issue that led to the removal of former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore from the bench in two thousand three the other ... deals with abortion\nApproval of these measures could potentially set the stage for future legal challenges Steven Brown teaches constitutional law at Auburn University I spoke with him about those amendments and we begin with the ten commandments\nAh it does authorize in contrast to Supreme Court opinion that you can go ahead and and put ten can sway maybe an state Capitol Grounds maybe in a public park or maybe inside schools all all those have been the source of legal challenges in the past\nAnd so this would just say you can do this\nBut it's got to be within existing rules well it does and I guess the ... the Alabama Legislature was aware of is that the court has it been completely consistent with is do we have any guidance on\nWhat are acceptable displays of the ten commandments we do and it comes from the Supreme Court but even from a local angle a judge Myra Thompson or just minor and Thompson was a\nFederal judge that had told a chief justice Roy Moore that them wash washing machine sized Ten Commandments monument that had been a place in the state judicial building is not appropriate for the court has said basically it all has to do with the intent\nIf there is a religious intent behind it then you're going to be on unquestionable constitutional grounds a if it's a historic display about law\nAnd this simply have to be one of the slaves in that historic display about law I think the footing as a little bit more solid but if it's if it's religion and you're going to just separate with all these things around it to make it look like it's a law display if the intent behind it all all along was a religious content that I think it will be suspect\nOr there's another part of this amendment that says it prohibits the expenditure of public funds in defense of the constitutionality of this and then what do you make of that that's a ... a curious line to put in there because if you're going to pass a law you would presume it's constitutional and if it's not you're going to defend outlawed [noise]\nOne of the ways to look at this also is that there are groups out there that finance challenges a legal challenges for conservative reasons and for a you know liberal reasons as well and that may be what a legislators who approved this were banking on us at a conservative group would pick this up with finance of legal challenge and take it all with the Supreme Court\nWell turning to amendment to this deals with abortion or a right to live on how you want to term it and it it says that it is the public policy of the state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn\nThe funding of abortion does this do anything different legally are practically\nWell again it's kind of a curious amendment because the Supreme Court has spoken both in ... and and more recently in this case you decision in Nineteen Ninety two about abortion about the constitutionality of abortion\nAnd so in my opinion this amendment right now on his face is actually unconstitutional it seems to be banking on future changes in terms of Supreme Court precedent [noise]\nBut to pass this now and to assume it's constitutional I I think his presumptions I I I think a space right now it is not constitutional and uh it will be challenged and as long as those previous presidents stand I think it will fail\nWe have recently seen justice Brett Kavanaugh come out of the Supreme Court that turns the court and the more conservative direction and it has been assuming there are changes to how abortion law is interpreted what might that mean is this and then that were to pass well so that's a great\nA great question just on the on the justice Kevin appoint a again will be weighed a Nineteen Seventy three uh that's been superseded by the case the decision of Nineteen Ninety two in a sorority weighed in at its heart is still good law but a lot of the parameters no longer are [noise]\nBut the plurality opinion in the case of decision was written by Sandra Day O'Connor Republican appointee Justice Souter of called an appointee and Kennedy a Republican appointee so I'm not sure people can count on either a Gorsuch or a cabin are someone else really in a

huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey ... for the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival of dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again and promised to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters\nThe need for the future presidents who respects to judge had to remind him and and people that people Brazil about the constitution\nSee it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as home Andrea\n... rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force than they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I

said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say\nUh and and that is that they have a lack of faith and her government um and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nWell I feel like you and I have talked um countless times of America on some of the challenges and calling her times embattled I mean she and her government have been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back in\nTwenty Fifteen rights away the wise why we arrived at this moment now what's different well\nThere's been a steady chipping away at her support uh basically on a national level but also\nEspecially uh the the most recent ones we can talk about last night's election or or yesterday's election I should say and ...\nWhich is where Frankfurt is the big financial center and also two weeks the form of area some serious losses where in last night's or a the count basically her party barely is hanging on to power with the coalition of greens are and in Bavaria they I mean it's\nIt's also really shaken up the the the very end allies of of Mrs ... which are uh the the Christian social union members have been Marian ... conservatives if you will\nSo I mean she's been so central to European politics it's hard to imagine European ... without her I mean what what is the reaction so far this this is\nWell the ah the stocks have gone down I mean this is something that's definitely going to send a a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or are they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try and integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the breakfast situation does negotiate in that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus\nAnd she's an incredibly weaken position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek re election until ... in twenty Twenty one and that she's basically going to remain in power until\nUh until then a but it and she's a lame duck at this point and any\nTalk of who are likely successor might be\nWell even though she hasn't really said who she wants on what what political insiders have told various media a is a hurt the city you general secretary unemployed come ... she's a fifty six year old\nWho's who's someone who many would like to see take her place but there are also other people like the health minister who is much more conservative and actually a good friend of the U.S ambassador to Berlin\nA and also a an an a political opponent of her as the least Matt who has not been in the politics for a while now um so yeah so there it's it's a big open question mark as to who's next\nIn Paris or as a hundred and also on this big announcement

lasted four months\nIt was itchy and like read the like poison oak\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was

left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock\nI didn't have any needle stalking me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges

company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charge for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw him on a grand embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it the ... the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin\nTest [noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test out of sophisticated level that you could do\nSomething advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live well\nNo the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look

ballot have already generated debate among legal scholars would involve the public display the ten commandments same issue that led to the removal of former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore from the bench in two thousand three\nThe other amendment deals with abortion approval of these measures could potentially set the stage for future legal challenges\nSeason Browne teaches constitutional law at Auburn University I spoke with him about those amendments and begins with the ten commandments\nAh it does authorize in contrast to Supreme Court opinion that you go ahead and and put ten can sway maybe on state Capitol Grounds maybe in a public park or maybe inside schools all all those have been the source of legal challenges in the past\nAnd so this would just say you can do this\nBut it's got to be within existing rules well it does and I guess the ... the Alabama Legislature was aware of is that the court has it been completely consistent with is do we have any guidance on what are acceptable displays of the ten commandments we do and it comes from the Supreme Court but even from\nA local angle a judge Myra Thompson or just wondering Thompson was a federal judge that had told a chief justice Roy Moore that the marsh washing machine sized Ten Commandments monument that had been a place in the state judicial building was not appropriate for the court has said basically it all has to do with the intent\nIf there's a religious intent behind it then you're going to be on unquestionable constitutional grounds or if it's a historic display about law\nAnd this simply have to be one of the slaves in that historic display about law I think the footing as a little bit more solid but if it's if it's religion and you're going to just separate with all these things around it to make it look like it's a law display if the intent behind it all all along was a religious intent that I think it will be suspect\nWell there's another part of this amendment that says it prohibits the expenditure of public\nFurious line to put in there because if you're going to pass a law you would presume it's constitutional and if it's not you're going to defend outlawed [noise]\nOne of the ways to look at this also is that there are groups out there that finance challenges a legal challenges for conservative reasons and for a you know liberal reasons as well\nAnd that may be what a legislators who approved this were banking on us at a conservative group would pick this up with finance of legal challenge and take it all with the Supreme Court well\nTurning to ... to this deals with abortion or a right to live streamed on how you want to term it and it it says that it is the public policy of the state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life\nAnd the rights of unborn children and it goes on to say the constitution of the state does not protect the right to abortion or require the funding of abortion does this\nDo anything different legally are practically\nWell again it's kind of a curious amendment because the Supreme Court has spoken both in ... and and more recently in this case he decision in Nineteen Ninety two about abortion about the constitutionality of abortion\nAnd so in my opinion this amendment right now on his face is actually unconstitutional it seems to be banking on future changes in terms of Supreme Court precedent [noise]\nBut to pass this now and to assume it's constitutional I I think his presumptions I I I think a space right now it is not constitutional and uh it will be challenged and as long as those previous precedents stand I think it will fail\nWe have recently seeing justice Brett Kavanaugh come on to the Supreme Court that turns the court in a more conservative direction that has been assuming there are changes to how abortion law is interpreted what might that mean if this and then that were to pass\nWell so that's a great a great question just on the on the justice Kevin appoint a again will be weighed a Nineteen Seventy three uh that's been superseded by the case the decision of Nineteen Ninety two in a sorority weighed in at its heart is still good law but a lot of the parameters no longer are [noise]\nBut the plurality opinion in that case the decision was written by Sandra Day O'Connor Republican appointee Justice Souter or of called them pointy and Kennedy a Republican appointee so I'm not sure people can count on either a Gorsuch or a cabin are someone else ruling in a particular way\nThese are hot button issues do you see these amendments motivating
