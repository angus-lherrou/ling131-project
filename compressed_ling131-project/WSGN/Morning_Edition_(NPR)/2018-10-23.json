accusations on the record today\nIs addressing a meeting of his ruling party he's been talking of the death of Jamal could show she walked into a Saudi consulate in Turkey on October second and never emerged\nEveryone says this death was a premeditated killing by Saudi Arabia ... native nation which his writings criticized the Saudi Government first said it knew nothing of his disappearance and then said show she died in a fight and that it is still investigating\nNPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul Hi there Peter ... so what evidence is there to one put on the table well\n... says the evidence that they have so far I strongly suggest that this was a planned operation basically dismissing the Saudis story that it was an accident a one new thing that he said uh is that\nPart of the evidence that they have is that the Saudi team that showed up in advance of the killing scout it out some areas possibly for disposal of a body\nHenri odd or to allow the Eighteen people they've arrested in connection with the show ... death to be prosecuted in Turkey they have all gone back to Riyadh or Saudi Arabia so they would have to be extradited\nUm the Turkish president also says uh this evidence they've got so far raises big questions including on whose orders was this killing carried out why there's such a delay and allowing the consulate another properties to be searched\nAnd why has the Saudi explanation of what happened changed so many times so it at all points to the fundamental question was it a rogue operation is Riyad suggests or what the leadership and\nOkay so some new information they're affirming on the record that the Turks believe this Saudi team scout at places to dispose of a body did aired on confirming any of the other various news reports about bits of damning information well\nProbably the biggest thing that has come out so far in anonymous ah reports from investigators is the\nClaim of a audio possibly even video evidence to back up the the

this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that you're trying to address\nBut we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering ah we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nNot only don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that\nWe'll effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing it\nWe've raised I guess about a little over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting and he'd earls or who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court seats\nAre you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way ah I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitutions as a as they have been written\nThat we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally\nAnd I think ... or a or a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made which you lift off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWhen they go low [noise] they go low\nWe can what did you mean but what I meant ... ... ... ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think through votes through protests um I I can say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump inauguration and it was very powerful\nOf measures those are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves attorney general holder thanks so much\nAnd I think you [noise]\n\nAll right Steve the mega millions lottery is up to one point six billion dollar billion billion with a B they're doing is set for tonight and yes it's a very exciting but your chances our chances of that one in three hundred million\nNow some people come up with plans to improve their odds in a big one is getting a bunch of coworkers together and forming in office pool what about that\nOne in three hundred million is the famous twenty three hundred million um they're both astronomical so the odds are basically the same\nJason Kirkland is a lawyer who represents jackpot winners and he says if your office pool does somehow when that is not necessarily good\nThere could be a lot of problems with office pools\nYeah sometimes not everybody knows who's in the group or out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nI've been to Bob where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I understand why people do it because\nYou know you'll feel terrible if you're going\nAnd you didn't contribute just because you didn't like that so I Would never say not to and I understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one person left out so I'm not going to say not to\nBut he will say this that\nThe last thing you need are twenty people at twenty lawyers or going to court and fighting over this and find the money up for years or or God Knows how much\nIf you do when and you need a lawyer he will

still investigating\nNPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul Hi there Peter ... so what evidence as one put on the table\nWell ... says the evidence that they have so far I strongly suggest that this was a planned operation basically dismissing the Saudis story that it was an accident\nA one new thing that he said uh is that part of the evidence that they have is that the Saudi team that showed up in advance of the killing scout it out some areas possibly for disposal of a body including a forest in North east ... uh and then he also or in his remarks called Henri odd\nOr to allow the Eighteen people they've arrested in connection with the show ... death\nTo be prosecuted in Turkey or they have all gone back to Riyadh or Saudi Arabia so they would have to be extradited\nUm the Turkish president also says ah this evidence they've got so far raises big questions including on whose orders was this killing carried out why there's such a delay and allowing the consulate know their properties to be searched\nAnd why has the Saudi explanation of what happened changed so many times so it at all points to the fundamental question was at a rogue operation is Riyad suggests or was the leadership and\nOkay so some new information they're affirming on the record that the Turks believe this Saudi team scout at places to dispose of a body did aired on confirm any of the other

but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they were elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty\nOne is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with the problem a partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that it's slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nYou in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans in conservative groups were spending\nSay the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a little over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter\nA state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting and eat or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court seats\nAre you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what you were ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWhen they go low\nYeah well what I meant ... in that remark was at a I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think votes through protests um I I Would say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the

on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question covers secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient that there have been inconsistencies in a row says testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question\nAnd the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence this is all preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the country\nAnd at this point it the Trump Administration could ask the Supreme Court to permanently block car secretary Wilbur Ross has deposition Oregon even asked the Supreme Court to hear this case so we're not quite sure right now what will happen to this trial if that is the case well\nWhat is the Supreme Court order mean for the states and cities that are suing over the citizenship question\nIt means that the
