a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is the stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nWill Steve rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious as the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops\nAnd they say there were more than five hundred homes that have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water\nSewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand\nBefore the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states the control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nCan sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area\nHis forces and where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nWriting that was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president\nCut that money they had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa\nSearches bomb removal and also education programs and that\nReally worried a lot of people it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates\nThat got these programs rolling again now President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve\nIf you don't provide people with the basic needs for a living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much time to your workers do [noise]\nIt's MORNING

copy of an FBI report this is the results of the agencies supplemental investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault when he was younger\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell said last night we should say before he read the report that the first vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation is going to take place tomorrow\nThere'll be plenty of time for members to review and being briefed on the supplemental material\nBefore friday cloture vote so I'm falling cloture on judge Kavanaugh's nomination this evening so the process can move forward\nI Want to bring in NPR's Ryan Lucas who has been following this story morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kavanaugh right I mean remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it\nThe answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on that Christine Blasey Ford's allegations\nA and a second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct or that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course uh classmates\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nDemocrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the legit incidents but the key thing to remember here is that\nUh the White House is the one in control of the background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House the president controls the parameters and the president has said\nWhile he's fine if the FBI talks to anybody out there or that he was providing direction to the FBI based off of what Senate Republicans wanted\nOkay well then I mean given all of that do we know what the scope was like who the FBI actually spoke to\nWe don't know specifically what the scope was but I've been able to confirm six people that the FBI I talked to was part of this or the bulk of the FBI's work appears to be focused on Ford's allegations are five of the people that the FBI I spoke to our high school friends have Kevin ... or forwards that's mark judge PJ Smith Tim God at Chris Garrett some of these names are familiar\nSeventy four UAB

did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity\nVery determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the mothers of angels\nOr this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't mince words

know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and not another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences

see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nRight and it was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut\nThat money they had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa such as bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet\nAnd here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for a living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq

DC\nAnd I'm David Greene in Culver City California this morning inside a secure room at the U.S Capitol senators are getting a chance to read a single copy of an FBI report this is the results of the agencies supplemental investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault when he was younger\nSet a majority leader Mitch McConnell said last night we should say before he read the report that the first vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation is going to take place tomorrow\nBe plenty of town for members review and being briefed on the supplemental material\nBefore friday close\nOh I can move forward I Want to bring in NPR's Ryan Lucas who has been following this story morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kavanaugh writing me remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it\nWell the answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on that Christine Blasey Ford's allegations\nAre and the second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct or that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's uh her story is that\nA cabinet exposed himself to her at a party when they were both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nDemocrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the legit incidents but the key thing to remember here is that\nUh the White House is the one in control of the background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House the president controls the parameters and the president has said\nWhile he's fine if the FBI talks to anybody out there or that he was providing direction to the FBI based off of what Senate Republicans wanted okay well\nThen I mean given all of that do we know what the scope was like who the FBI actually\nSpoke to we don't know specifically what the scope was but I've been able to confirm six people that the FBI I talked to was part of this uh the bulk of the FBI's work appears to be focused on Ford's allegations\nMost Republican voters support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite sexual assault allegations against him\nThat could make it difficult for red state Democrats up for reelection like West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin\nI'm hoping Mr Manchin will vote for Kevin home because we are conservative state even if we do put liberals in there\nThe view from West Virginia this afternoon on all

were born with microcephaly or abnormally small heads among other impediments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called Zeke a love stories among the people he met words you're ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nYou lost your emotional about this on our ... to get him out of ... gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was obvious cut remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened [noise]\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very to time and women some of them um were engaged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong\nBut the night shift mothers of angels or this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well\nI mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is they they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind the pay is it you know at the at that age\nBut then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that tell me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around\nIt's an incredibly mixed thing\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the story of twins a girl who was born with physical virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nIt was you had this franchise little ... minutes of its or as she was cooled or she really couldn't move very much so she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affects\nBut they now know that some people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that Zeke affected families are at a turning point why is this an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families are really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to know and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what they're going to about ... and\nSo we're able to join the um the actual ... she went around some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil and she was kind of giving talks to these women and giving the pep talks and just sort of saying you know you need to write to the magnates right to the health secretary telling to give you a bus to tell you a charter school you know this kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning took the issues that they really start to deal with now\n[noise] I Wonder because you have this personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from this Chet how did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way\nThe children were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially it was very similar to my little girl she reminded me so much with my ... year ago and holding how it was just like holding my little girl\nAnd her mom was at that point where I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing\nI did not Eighteen months Katie my daughter has done so much and I really wanted to say to ... she's gotta worry she'll come you know but you can't you know you just don't know where every child
