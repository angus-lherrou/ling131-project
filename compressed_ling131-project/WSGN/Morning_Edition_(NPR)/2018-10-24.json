is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't

fall state elections Democrats want to take some of that power away\nYou know the old the and the head a faith based approach to mid term elections they always say that the cat is when but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw the district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican who oversees his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense so when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there are several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even changed the chamber\nYou have a one seat majorities in a Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which no seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important uh for\nAnd Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat\nAnd you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and you had Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right [noise] well\nI Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representatives that people can count on carrying the interests of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical but\nWhat you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is to understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think\nThe drink to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties\nThe Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focus on sort of installing a a a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities That's Matt\nWalter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic flooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most shelf member station ... has more [noise]\nRushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate milk it's been so turned off by flooding around ... even when it goes Austin's treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter so on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they're going to use for drinking in food ... [noise] but you can probably guess what happened next and I'm calling in as I say\n... ... yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit how many\nBottles people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I start thinking about you know just ... that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are close to cafes aren't serving so you need a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio central water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure and its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years this has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nGreg ... is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf it loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as microorganisms sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there a says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nSays if conservation continues and the weather cooperates\nLast days beyond that for NPR News I'm mostly shell in Austin [noise]\nAnd this is NPR News and this is your NPR station id\nPoint when you ... gym\nRadio for the heart of Alabama\nMorning I'm Andrew Yeager It's Wednesday October twenty four\nYear news this morning edition [noise]\nHarris the lead to bike sharing system and became a huge success and appointed price in the city that's until this year when it changed operators almost collapse [noise] what happened in about Fifteen minutes [noise]\nWhat we've seen is not only a a a stretch of time when you have an executive branch that has been breaking norms but you have a Congress is set by without consequences allowed that to happen without significant accountability\nDemocrats would face pressure from their base to impeach President Trump House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says she's against it here she is last week at Harvard Institute of politics\nI changed their life is\nBelow sea says Democrats should go after Trump's tax returns he's refused to disclose them Democrats would have the authority to get some\nAt the house intelligence committee perspective chair Adam Schiff of California says he would probe allegations that Russia has financial leverage over Trump\nThe Trump Administration has ignored virtually all information requests from congressional Democrats but there is a workaround for that get the documents from friendly nonprofit groups that get them through the freedom of Information Act Austin Evers is director of American oversight a progressive group that snow filing for your request\nIs actually very difficult to enforce the congressional subpoena in court in contrast a freedom of Information Act request which we could file we can go to court very easily and force agencies to be transparent\nIt's worth noting this for your strategy was owned by conservative groups in the Obama era\nHouse Democrats plan to have all the committee's doing oversight investigating cabinet secretaries who broke the rules protecting Obamacare finding out what went wrong with hurricane relief and tackling other issues that Republicans have brushed off\nOne master of oversight is former congressman Henry Waxman during forty years in the house he investigated everything from the tobacco industry to the Iraq War\nWaxman listed three goals have good oversight stopped a waste of money hold people accountable and make government work the way it should his word of caution to House Democrats don't do oversight\nWhich is in credible amount of power and abused it for simply political\nPoints simply to advance their election interests Waxman said that's not what oversight should be about Peter Overby NPR News Washington [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nServing consider point this is your NPR station id point three W.
