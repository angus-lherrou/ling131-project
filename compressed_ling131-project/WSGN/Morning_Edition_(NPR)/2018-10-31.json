weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can't take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously all\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal you know so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana now George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest me [noise] you know what are they talking about they talking about the the elite you ever see the elite\nHer says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nDanger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent\nTrump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter\nAnd he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments of hatred of is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys at my school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's structured and accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an

math sword fighting with ...

generate nine billion dollars this year and pop shops are all about getting some of that retail dollar Cortland Hickey is general manager of Chicago costume\nAnd people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nSays in the past they've opened as many as eat pop up shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent\nIs that ... appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nThey're using that pop up model to sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed ... says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... to regret and we walked in the ... and we've seen a lot of celebrities you know like fingers homers function their own brand\nHe says record labels have even set a pop up centered around a specific artist oh washed as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're challenging traditional model for long term is then you're replacing it by a space which he's getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up under turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is absolutely no ducks right now the short term is and your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases friend PR News I'm Suzie on in Chicago\nIt's

believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nThink they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like\nTired of it so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican in the coming election [noise]\nHave you talk to your family about your about your evolution\nI has

motive\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her story of the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to first and only go so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is ...\nFear the theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest way for [noise] you know what are they talking about talking about the the leaf you ever see the elite\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection he wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to\nThe resentment that hatred of is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is

balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords used to ... short term leases but Steve shorts with commercial real estate service jail allows says that few appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a lamb or to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of

awash says as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model for long term is then you're reproducing made by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop a friend who turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution ... right now the short term is and your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more

first sentence begins\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states all persons born here are citizens\nPresident Trump says he can go around that days before an election that he wants to make about immigration the president talked of trying to eliminate citizenship for children born into us to immigrants who are here illegally he says he could use an executive order although the Republican speaker of the house Paul Ryan says that is not pass\nAnd ship and that particular case Mr Hands on walking back to the program Hi thank you for having\nI have to know the president raise this idea in his campaign years ago but hasn't tried that sense now raises it suddenly days before the election is this anything more than an election ploy\nWell I think so first of all he raised it in response to an asked questions so everyone who was looking for some kind of um you know deeply cynical motive here is wrong or he was asked the question apparently it's something he had been discussing with the staff for many weeks\nYeah he did say he'd been talking about a reporter\nGot wind of that and ask him about it and he gave an honest answer I I also have to take issue with what you said in your opening that the\nThe fourteenth amendment is clear and therefore requires this practice what you read the amendment right and I think you I I'm pretty certain I Know you're misinterpreting the central cause subject to the jurisdiction there up\nThat does not mean simply that you're subject to US law it's long been known in international law than any person who comes to another country for any reason whether there is there as a tourist whether there on business whether they're just transiting through as a matter of travel\nThey're subject to the law of that country while they're there so being physically present means you're subject to the law in a sentence defining citizenship therefore subject to the jurisdiction must have another meaning\nWell or else it's ... there's this subject\nTo the jurisdiction there are when I've done some reading on this it appears to me that that applies to people like

they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I so I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nI almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and yeah the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about you know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to\nVoice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity how did that take shape short it was after\nThe twenty sixteen\nAll these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before and my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more because I I had thought before that I'd been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been [noise] I\nUnderstand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics for the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so\nDon't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nMade me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting\nBut I think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't\nPersonally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just Anchorage\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite\nPresident Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and not coming election [noise]\nHave you talked to your family about your about your evolution\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to
