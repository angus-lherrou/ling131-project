S.\nAnd from Americans for the arts\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David dream and I'm Rachel Martin the founders of this country designed Congress to constrain presidential powers\nAnd when it came to war the draft or is that the constitution did not want that consequential decision in the hands of just one person among them was James Madison presidential historian Michael Beschloss says when Madison became president himself\nHe learned that war is can we political benefits Steve Inskeep spoke spoke to bash last about his new book is titled presidents of war\nMadison was the one who said men are not angels he was so worried of a president who had bad judgment or would try to get us involved in a war for political reasons he was trying to slam the door on that\nBut once he was president and Eighteen twelve he's the one who opened the door to a president go into Congress than saying I think there should be a war and if you hadn't had Madison do that it might have been a much longer time before presidents could make were almost single head what was the situation that the United states faced in Eighteen twelve\nThe United states had ships that were being harassed by the British are a lot of Americans want it to grab Canada so there was a ...\nAnd said well you know maybe there is a good rationale for having a war\nAnd Madison sort of like the idea of being a war president himself exactly the opposite of\nThe way he was in Seventy and eighty seven in Philadelphia I'm thinking of that old saying that where you stand is determined by where you sit when he was sitting in what we now call the White House he started seeing things differently than the horrific way of putting it in Madison also knew that\nIt would be politically useful to him and Eighteen twelve he was running for re election to have a war that he was the biggest advocate of\nSounds pretty modern doesn't it so James Madison is one of the presidents who gives the president a role in warm making although they're still asking Congress at that point festivals let's go ahead a few decades James Cape Polk is president of the United states in the Eighteen forties what did he do\nWell James ... was a liar and achieve and a boy and he wanted the United states to have a big war\nWith Mexico and his hidden agenda was he wanted to get New Mexico he wanted to get California which were owned by Mexico at that time a lot of other land and added to the United states\nEighteen forty six he sent American troops down to the Texas border to provoke the Mexicans the Mexicans fought back and poked says look there's been this terrible attack on us by Mexico we need a big war Congress gladly gave it\nTo I guess we should just explain this a little more he sent troops into disputed territory between the U.S and Mexico right\nHe did and the result was Polk had essentially fabricated an incident would allow him to go to Congress than say we need a big war with Mexico\nBut wait a minute here he's still like to ask Congress Congress still had to act how did senators respond when they were challenged by this guy was essentially taking their authority away\nMany senators sad that focus trying to cheat him they question the reason that we were going to war but they voted for this war overwhelmingly and set the pattern for the future why did they do that\nThey knew that the war would be popular they knew that many people would say the Mexicans attacked us why are we fighting back would be very hard for them to say no and that was a pattern that lasted into the future okay", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "11"}
