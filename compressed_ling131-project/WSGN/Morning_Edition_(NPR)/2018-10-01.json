depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as as many kids by finding the ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but\nYou see that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard why to improve those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available\nInteractive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen shed he and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\n... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte image of it\nIt's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years worked with people who live in poverty\nSo I saw what she saw was a segregated city were low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder Carmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at as to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have up here right now it's just kind of a ... a map of median income\nIn Charlotte said a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility\nIf it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is that\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school\nIt's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric ... says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we have forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte\nTo have a student body this largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now in education\nDo something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now\nBut we're in the coming years it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe such field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park\nBut the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park Ford says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us started making really smart and really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allow we could look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction Mecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the city of Charlotte has a fifty million dollar bond issue for affordable housing on November ballot\nRoss chatty says he hopes the opportunity at less well help

Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine jointly to James on this phone how school ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris going Richard good morning so who are these two winners\nWell the prices being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and also by to sue ... who's at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes just a complete surprise itself not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock of but what exactly did these two scientists\nDo well I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells and\nThey came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes may be the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may her now that we've talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning this word ... how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one and ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs one example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called key true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar\nTo attack and it certainly is there more effective target\nHuh fascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how how we think about cancer care\nWell before the scientist made their discoveries catch her treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and this whole world of immunotherapy is no really the driving force behind drug development\nThese days right I mean we hear a lot about immunotherapy how effective are these new therapies that's what one really wants to know it went and that's it and\nEvolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery ... remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of the story I\nOkay NPR science

options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat's Doug badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nWho think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what\nSick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage that's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met\nSo people have something called health insurance but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people
