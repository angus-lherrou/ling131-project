Kennedy had enormous crowds in Nineteen sixty he was constantly straining to fire codes\nOr the night before the election and he was at the Boston Garden were twenty two thousand people were estimated to be there I was actually there David and it was terrifying there were so many people while I'm but also keep in mind that in early history\nIt was considered unseemly for presidents or presidential candidates to campaign though they did it through surrogates a course which is pretty much what Trump is doing for Republican candidates this year\nWhere there was a time when candidates didn't want to campaign\nI Know isn't it doesn't sound restful in real but [laughter] but Andrew Johnson when he was president did go out on the campaign trail in Eighteen sixty six campaign against the Republicans in Congress that he thought were too radical\nIt was called his swing around the circle it backfired totally um it didn't help that he often appeared to be drunk and sometimes fell off the platform of growing up but it's also true that much of the public and press a thought it was just undignified for the president to engage in a campaign\nWell then the next question comes from someone who uses the Twitter name what you hear this give me a freaking break for the live free didn't break during was there ever a time when money wasn't an issue it sounds snarky but I'm hoping history has a positive example of where\nIt wasn't the question was money ever not so involved\nI hate to disappoint gimme African break but um basically money's been there since the beginning or we talked recently on one of these talks about how George Washington had wind and dined voters when he was running for the Virginia house of purchases right cause that body to pass the nation's first campaign finance law\nThe first few presidential campaigns were not particularly a dependent on money uh but that changed with Andrew Jackson and Eighteen twenty eight when he ran much more of a grassroots campaign\nAnd then an Eighteen thirty two he was re nominated at the national political convention and of course as you well know David political conventions costs money while you're there and that um and from there on out or it's basically been Katy bar the door\nFor the rest is history from yogurt\nOr email your questions to ask Cokie at NPR dot org [noise]\n\nI'm a ...\nKnowing what's happening in the midterm elections before you vote in November is important but what about what's going to happen in December or January when you give every month you help NPR cover the entire election what happened before what's going on now and especially what's coming now\nBe a part of what comes next become a sustained member today [noise]\nTo do that by calling eight hundred for for for nine two four six or go on line to WBAI Jim dot O.
