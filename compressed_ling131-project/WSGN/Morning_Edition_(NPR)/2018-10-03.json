be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate an athlete you know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic in trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and\nIncluding ... that's what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to the antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nMean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness\nBy using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight\nCancer we heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z or ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price to\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean France is Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years um the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know ... it's a little bit um

Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh\nAnd this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they're trying to do and I think we should probably also point out that

from NPR News I'm students get and I'm Rachel Martin is Nobel Prize week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nComing up it was called took her to be in order to build the top of the last you know from from good decision be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winters presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California\nAnd the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early nineties\nIn print enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and\nIncluding antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness and too important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z or ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price to\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean France is Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years um the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day

Korea was that neighboring communist China considered the Americans that threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially an intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army\nBut then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because he wanted to finish the job\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant

saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on
