ranging interview that aired on CBS last night with President Trump\nNPR's White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe joins us now going good morning so Turkish investigators say a democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outline what the severe punishment might be as Saudi has proven to have been behind us he did not uh\nIn ... that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia a and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take a strong action\nAnd he at least open the

industry said they need a drink bourbon\nWhiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is\nMade it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's great sources of the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lump sum shelf\nShell filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon is about a hundred and twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably your global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a napkin you agreement so what\nHave people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what is that looked like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWe don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five years\nWell you know have people that you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious this is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongress and bar has been very helpful to us\nIn the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he told us he understood exactly that this would this mean for us\nBerman is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right is a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make in Kentucky beginning a next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA a I think that's when you could start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and is from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for a generation\nEric Gregory Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable rather than non functional found made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster is\nA lot of trees down just on the outskirts of products\nHomeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor the situation like that we're relying on aerial shots and decided to look at it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas have lost a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and Scott industry is just\nDevastated Chris Chandler isn't adjuster without insurance in Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nCaught was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred mile per hour winds just blows it away but last April source of income us our livelihood\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything\nBack to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you're you're you're talking to people that houses have destroyed all their belongings showed her pictures no amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your parents that are passed away to your child first birthday\nWhile some things are lost forever he says communities are already working together to start to rebuild Neil Diamond asking NPR News [noise]\nThis is NPR News and this is your NPR station Ninety three WBAI Jim Birmingham\nPublic radio for the heart of Alabama morning I'm Andrew Yeager in his Monday October Fifteen [noise]\nThe argues It's MORNING edition [noise]\nMinutes means government is pass legislation that will allow officials to move the remains the country's former dictator\nOn the ph [noise]\nAnd there will be a bowling because if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it won't be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if you try to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party former\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blamed Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll save the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang onto power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nOoh ooh oh\nListening this morning to you or NPR station\nGiving up

are concerned enough about injuries that they're not allowing them at all when they enter\nThe sector of transportation that's also entering the sector public health so it becomes a different ball game and we need to make sure that we're doing it safely\nIn San Francisco Juilliard as part of the city's injury prevention collaborative which is collecting data on a split or injuries are they happening at particular intersections our people fracturing goals or sprinting ankles or are some types of scooters more dangerous than others\nSo you have to look at the patterns to see where the the

going to make time and do the shots really work anyway\nThis next story may change the way you think last year was one of the deadliest flu seasons in decades and estimated eighty thousand Americans died\nAnd thirty nine year old St Louis man was almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCharlie hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against it\nWhose health in their thirties Charlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association\nIn like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong wrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week in a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nAnd I got an anti gay or having from Shane running out and\nStill have a call but by and Larsen says improved tones there was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put into medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors are worried about brain damage he\nNeeded a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity\nBut Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but all the family members that came to visit got a two for you know they got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still\nAt him I was laying awake at nights I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year\nThis is why you should get a flu shot slowly\nLife is returning to normal for Charlie except for one
