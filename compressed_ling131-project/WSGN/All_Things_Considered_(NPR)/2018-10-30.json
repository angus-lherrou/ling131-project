CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire\nShould not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say that Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrants caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and that this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U.

the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women at our jars\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country how do we do to go around and hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nI think that the trust was by the women's march I had actually when I was calling\nFrom or this is Michelle nearly she works and communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly is underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... he's away from family we show what is\nWhat is it why why\nDon't we\nSeveral women

more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman properly right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that you know no longer\nWhen running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\nWhat are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis was a new

white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen Andrew ...\nThe CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition that there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour but again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally the third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check Mart from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nAnd want to play a piece of tape for you or NPR reporter Jasmine guards\nWould you expect us to do it like that you want us to just censor anybody that's a phrase I'm going in that what you're proposing here and here's the thing he answered the bad or each or you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTroll cereal harasser as people generally opt out not many people go on line to\nDefend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment company's apps stores they've all cut

sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down in individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nFrom the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting raining here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nAh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sixteen uh a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from other\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI\nYour story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you

crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived at first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just

CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check forest can the president do this most constitutional\nScholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and that children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they've got a president in an office who apparently as fixated on that\nWhich is and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrants caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and that this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to all our birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U.

senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women at our jobs\nYou know we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country and how do you go around and he hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first\nI think the trust was gone by the women's march I have not showing up is called [laughter]\nGod that from this is Michelle nearly she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nWhite women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turning away from family we show or what is\nWhat is the last wife well you\nKnow we only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to\nAffect their chances of being real known as black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually\nMissing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well like I get up relationships in the middle of it because I Lived in the legal and the other police officers say something live well\nHe fits the profile ...\nDaddy's sticks to my brother is these three Zero Dark skin\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman properly right now she's making her own ... to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\nWhat are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nBlack women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nI think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all that's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with Ayanna Pressley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC a directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment\nAnd when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for

before it was taken down how do people and gab react to the Senate God's shooting\nThere was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning\nThat's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present to clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention can you describe\nHow gab became a home and the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen Andrew ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour bus again went on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements I Want to\nPlay a piece of tape for you or NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed got CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours posts when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you expect it to do it like that you want to censor anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or a beach or you want to define that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be president on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTroll cereal harasser as people generally opt out not many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that get served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says\nStories they've all cut ties with gas and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend\nHow likely is that\nWell I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace their servers their domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find

Saturday Hi Brian IRA it tell us about what the president did during the visit\nOr the president to end the first lady and also Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump or right here at the synagogue gets quiet

I understand too if the police officers injured in that attack are still being treated there tell us about what happened to the hospital\nRight the president met with all of the six officers wounded while responding to this attack Daniel Mead was shot in the hand Timothy maps and suffered multiple gunshot wounds they're still being cared for their\nUm him that the president met with that and also

officers were there\nAnd during the visit he was accompanied by Israel's ambassador to the U. S. round during\nThis visit has been controversial uh Pittsburgh mayor was invited to meet with the president and declined what if people they're told you\nYeah this is a a really complicated time for people in the city um there has been a real debate here about whether the president has the right figure to be involved in this period of mourning\nI spoke earlier today with Angela feral who attended one of the funerals in the squirrel hill neighborhood uh and she said she thinks a male Mayor Bill ... should have met with the president\nI don't think it's a good thing that the mayor is suffering the president I think that the masses\nIt's filled with Nathan Siegel he was marching ah and and he says he grew up in the squirrel hill neighborhood attending the tree of life synagogue\nIt's my home and it's really terrifying and I'm thinking that Trump would have the audacity to appear here when he has a naval this island it's constantly fanning the flames of have he does not speak for me and I don't want him in my community\nSo you can hear Ari emotions are are really high I I Do want to say that protesters really made a show of thanking police and other first responders who helped after this attack so even if they were criticizing the president a lot of people here were calling for unity and healing\nAnd just briefly there were four funerals today seven more to come in the days ahead I Know you talk with some people attending those services what did you hear from them\nYou know it's interesting there's a lot of sadness a lot of anger and horror at what happened here but people are talking about the need for action going forward people talking about voting obviously the mid term elections are coming up they're talking about a need for new civility in American politics hoping

I'm Ari Shapiro and I said Chang let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\n... a spokesman for the office Peter ... says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller\nCart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's office was you know it's usually very tight lipped in but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent\nAt this point okay but do we know anything about this purported plots\nBut it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalist and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller so allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller\nYou use the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down in individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four\nTold me that it has no record of this individual working\nFrom the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nAh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember or around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sixteen uh a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims it's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole regular regular moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months\nMore than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's ... eyes and men explains why this outbreak has proven difficult to end\nMonth she found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd yet Rick yeah if you're young rocks that somehow to empty bottles idea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator at these safe\nBurial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola\nIs seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived at first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\n... long before the boy's father rushed in and said you changed his mind he didn't want his son take him to ...\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nAll great all credit to some Vermont to be you're going to be now you're just fear the worst read or you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing fear will provoke around you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nIdea and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's ... is a senior analyst with international crisis group\nLocal population is very distrustful of government\nEven though this part of the DR see has a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor may believe the ruling authorities only care about exploiting the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from this government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not of the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on when an authority figure be it from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even real you know whether they're true motives the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city have been staging street protests during which Ebola responders are forced to hunker down\nThat includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking the Ebola epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nEvery time he was harbinger teams don't go out they don't see the contracts and the disease\nInternational crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence Cindy RC so it's very unlikely that peacekeepers and the outbreak zone right now the UN's main focus on the deer see our elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fears at the un has to shift its pieces on the transport\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC is Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling book\nThe longer this goes on we may get to the point where they're putting a fact that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...
