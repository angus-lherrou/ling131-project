B. A. dot org and thank you [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro in this midterm election season many people are talking about the possibility of a blue wave there's also potential for a rainbow wave a record number of openly el GB to Q. people are on the ballot\nClear candidates today we're going to talk with three of them a\nMillion mark has is a Democrat in Montana she is running for the state legislature and the buildings area and she would be the first openly transgender person ever elected in Montana welcome Amelia Hi\nGina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you\nAnd Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate thanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nThis is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae beauty woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games\nAt the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed\nExperience yeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than interns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my eggs into a\n[laughter] and I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard to murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat two key writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is\nIt's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about I mean a million\nOur national political conversation which feels\nSo starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae T. Q. candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia disgust which is a you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community in our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having a young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of us [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR in ...\nIs that general manager Chuck homes that afternoon check I didn't say how are ya I'm pretty good I'd be even better you know if we can reach that goal of four hundred thousand dollars of course we're still inside of our fall finding Dr phil we're halfway there\nWe're halfway there and work [noise] we've set aside until uh the end of the day friday to get this thing done but we can get it done now are you listeners in Birmingham and across Alabama can help us in this Dr early or we would love to see our phones are lighting up or right now with calls\nFrom listeners who are giving their donations to WB H M maybe a first time to nation maybe you've listened to WB H him\nFor a while you enjoy the program and you've always meant to give you just haven't gotten around to it will now at the time to do it now's the time to step up and support factories journalism excellent storytelling context that you can use all those things come to you for free for free we don't ask\nAnyone to pay any kind of price tag we don't put any sort of\nSubscription fee on what it is we do what we do it\nSince Nineteen eighty I became a member of because I started listening to W.

B. H M dot org thanks [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro women in prison are far more likely than men to get punished for lesser violations of prisoner rules\nNPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's the sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors shots [noise]\nThese are the doors of the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a summer\nThis place cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don and helped us depending on what level there and that's the warden showed Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community as when I was fired for outside and our yard with ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the war and is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh\nBecause across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rolls they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women said men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain I have one um\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men of other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow dom tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform it was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just\nWant to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDom is putting in place a practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different paths\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules so especially about clothing and tone corrections officers\nTo listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nTell me that if that was like [laughter] that's okay I've heard\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runners in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise] it was just meant to be punished once\nShe was sick and stayed in her cell through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put it by her pillow size asleep when this crime happened [laughter] ... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item yeah that was pretty rough that\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then ... says she lost good conduct credits those are days taken off are sentenced for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder a serving time per second degree murder now she says the change in the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I said it's institution so I'm not so much shame [noise] you know and it has helped me with my own my own shame them I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about ... common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light\nThere are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in a basement sold his property victims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries men in prison that long\nBefore they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence so one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nWe always say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said is you know war and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six to not caused problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one of their place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above\nWhen women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night this is what prison cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack back to white giving off fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in a cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR

to separate being an algae petite woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou have the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics it's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh\nIn you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard to murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is\nIt's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nI'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we can evolve\nAnd tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what a million discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nOne of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are falling behind us I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and Amelia Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all your pleasure pleasure to speak with all your [noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm Audie Cornish and you're able to hear stories from across\nThe country because people open their homes to public radio reporters and hosts like me and in return we show our gratitude by getting the story right putting stories into proper context you can show your gratitude to public radio by becoming a sustaining member that door open for your community\nHere's how give us a call a one eight hundred for for for nine two four\nSix or you can give on line at W.\nB.

Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia or do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington and I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences and my relationship with Washington\nIf you take for example Philippine president ...\nUh who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as of drug dealers\nThere's a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to\nThat that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was ... in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this was happening more because President Trump is in office\nThey're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad the first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare\nBut the United states doesn't\nAnd they all do a day marsh together or the issue simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself and when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition it deters other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these dictators but it's undermining the international alliances that used to speak with one strong voice against the actions of those leaders\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from logged me in makers have go to meeting a collaborative meeting

this NPR station this is all things considered\nFrom NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro women in prison are far more likely than men to get punished for lesser violations of prisoner rules NPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week\nToday NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's the sound\nWe associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors finding shot [noise]\nThese are the doors of the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this place cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from John and helped us ... depending on what level there and that's the warning show Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community of right now are for outside and our yard within ... and I guess it's still\nA prison the Warren is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places\nIn some ways women's prisons are especially harsh because across the country women get disciplined that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR ... school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's in men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences women get time added to the prisons\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger this prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stay and I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow Don toes were corrections officers to give up fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signal a gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women\nWant to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nNominees putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different pass the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules so special about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nTell me about a battle [laughter] [noise]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise] it was just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and stayed in herself through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put a fire pillow so I was asleep when this crime happened [laughter] ... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item yeah that was pretty rough that\nBe a violation today but back then wonder says she wants good conduct credits those were days taken off are sentenced for good behavior\nSecond degree murder now she says the change in the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can sit institution so I'm not so much shame [noise]\nYou know and it has helped me with my own my own shame and my own regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a garden and lots of natural light\nThere are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that have been changed for months at a time in a basement sold his property or victims of satanic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nWe always say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe Warren has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said as you know word and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one of you to Ninety six women\nSo let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six to not cash problems dom wanted to show me\nThat wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above\nWhen women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night this is what prison cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack it's back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead to ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nLaura how women running prisons are making a difference in the way they are rough you're listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News [noise] re question of the great thing and that's a great question another great question that's a that's a great question [laughter] that's a great question that is a great question with great question and\nFresh air you'll hear unexpected questions and\nUnexpected engineering [noise] messy came from seven to eight or Ninety point three ... [noise] a\nServing mine I was this is your NPR station Ninety point three WB H in Birmingham and one of ... in Fort Paine and\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR in WBAI Chan did evening it six thirty\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings and person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously in both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first\nAh and cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he ...\nWhite House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Christian or\nA and that continued as president and so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared enough August there is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not\nHappy with questioners a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to a Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... showed gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him\nA and for foreign leaders to
