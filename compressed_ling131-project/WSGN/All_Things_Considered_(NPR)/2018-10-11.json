Ehrlich at the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful they used to sneak to identify individuals\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA from more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person and you start the base as a because that illuminates hundreds of these ... so it's enough to have your third cousin or your second cousin once removed in these databases to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS system uses multiple satellites to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do that the war but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to it\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police currency is using these techniques to find these really like you know married to\nUh I don't know in the political demonstration that lifted DNA behind a wheel K with foreign governments are going to exploited this technique to defy us citizens for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you could think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're horrific in murders of children things like that it's just [noise] [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd great tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused Rob Stein NPR News [noise]\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero was fascinated in El Salvador in Nineteen eighty Romero was a dedicated champion of the poor and marginalized tomorrow the Catholic Church will make him think you can hear that story tomorrow by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local station by name\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI'm Brenda Walker and I'm a WBAI Jim member\nProbably when I was in high school I really started to listen all the time\nThat was back in the transistor radio I listen all the time of the music because that's the only place I could hear it other than a actually purchasing it and planning [noise]\nFinally got a job I started to contribute because you listen to the races and you're the one they're talking about who listens all the time but don't contribute anything [noise]\nI continue to support the Asian because I really believe in what the station does\nAll of it and I really believe in in the station\nItself I Believe in the purpose of them [noise]\nCall one eight hundred for for for nine two four six or go to W.

Louise\nKelly at least six people have been killed since hurricane Michael blasted a short yesterday the category for storm left a huge trail of destruction along the Florida Panhandle\nIncluding in the coastal community of Mexico beach which is where we find NPR's Greg Allen and the phone lines in Mexico beach are understandably not great but we think we've got you hey there Greg\nHi Mary Louise how bad is it [noise] [noise] well\nIt's what you would expect to you know it was a category for storm nearly category five which came ashore right here the I passed right over this this area and Mexico beach which is a very small community you know a storm surge came in and you can see signs of every of every where there are still lots of standing water here\nMost of the water went out but there's still plenty of it around\nBut it was those wins in a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds just tore our hearts many buildings here lifted up entire buildings through them down and other ones you saw roofs off you know siding off sides off um luckily the most people who had left and weren't here to Seattle\nAnd are you able to drive around them into the streets relative it clear of water\n\nYes to hear that it's a very small community and the through the streets themselves and not too bad getting here is another matter you know we came over from Tallahassee today it should be a couple of hours my producer Becky Sullivan and I took us nine hours to get here because you just don't know what roads are open and the roads are open they're just barely open you have to drive around this round down trees\nYour power crews out and and in in ... and good Samaritans doing what they can\nAnd\nTwo hours right what about the impact on people I mean there's always with the storm some people stayed they rode out the storm I assume you've been out talking to them what are they saying\nYeah I mean it's it's a tough one I talked to a man here who stayed and he said he left in hurricane oval which was in Nineteen Ninety five and it's always regretted it is so hard to get back into the community later he always where he'd states we stayed\nAnd he said the strong as like anything he was prepared for it or at ever experienced before you know the the sound the noise the the windows the walls flexing and he had a little safer and built for himself and his pets at one point he said it became so he's something told him that this was no longer safe\nAnd they moved to an inter a bathroom and does that happen windows shattered glass blasted and he said they certainly would've been injured at that been the case and he kind of struggled to patch of his window and rode out the rest of the storm\nAnd ah today he's here repairing his house with a neighbor\nYou know I asked him if he was sorry that he stayed he says no he'd do it again because he says if I didn't stay there all my mature all my possessions everything we get ruined by the rain and the other stuff coming in\nAnd what about the people who did evacuate is there any kind of timeframe on when they might be able to come home [noise]\nUh no I don't I'm not not yet as far as I Know when you arrive engulf a county here\nYou get an alert on your cell phone telling you that only for sponsors are allowed in the county at this point that they don't that even private even people who live here residents are not allowed back and so there's road blocks that many all the the major intersections\nAnd many many people are being turned away um it to their frustration so it's they're worried about the safety because there are still wires down\nBut now is it time to stop taking public radio for granted because at any moment like any other media it could be gone it could be it could disappear just like that\nOne eight hundred for for for nine two four six\nYou know I heard somebody say the other day and I can't remember who it was but they said something to the effect of\n'em don't don't be sitting around wishing you had given when the service is no longer there you know that happens all the time you think I'm going to do the thing I'm going to do this thing and then when you when you go to do it then it's not there anymore and you are so guilty one eight hundred for for for nine two four six\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm outfit Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers on local leaders are trying to do\nIt different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a rough\nFew years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has followed some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the

turns out opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems like\nChicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump says the widespread\nStopping and ... and potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stops which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime worse and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in\nWe really haven't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that

out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously you guys even in the stories\nAcknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like a ... little mice chasing every time Donald Trump's or something it doesn't have any value\nTrips opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the abyss rations brief is not likely to stop its approval in court
