shit as a big flight deck and the U.S Marines were actually launching heavy trucks on huge Hubbard craft and wish it was really striking Henri\nIt was in the middle of a fjord snow capped mountains

Britain and Norway oil and lots of other countries all coordinating a mock assault on the shoreline here\nMany years is is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be re focusing more on its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they're staging right now has a NATO forces defend the country that's been attacked by an unnamed invader\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume this fictitious invader is Russia and earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the eastern and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength that I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James logo he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and he said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic with it so we may be challenged and so ah if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nSo what ... saying is you know if anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been from about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground what\nWe see is stunts or they're not just states

with someone from a different identity group\nThat that's something we see here ah you know in the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions\nThe way to prevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have in in their own lives is really taking the first

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nAre the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president's so nice to meet you drink graduations on your economy but\nIt's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen the yuan fault it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they ... and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand\nMeanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't stay well\nPartly counteracted\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the falling you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find it cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below project\nHas promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currents\nThese New York China's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like\nWhat you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist Stacey Vanek

consumption which means that you can take a speed train you can fly\nChina started to block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust in banking and financial system and part of this was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town you discovered another aspect of being on

whenever he went out whenever he'd see the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew for\nA lot of money there with all of our own stores and we used to be working in a semi industry as I did on now they're\nLoud one started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist\nYou started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to she started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around there were about what don't\nBecause actually friday the widespread attitude towards us is very resistant\nPeople will take to why are you cure been happy why do you still have time to be happy or why do you not go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loud one says you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about one point two million to go but\nEven when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked lawyers and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment\nLoud one says she will keep paying off its debt has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey

Seventy seven percent of Republicans believe their common but most Democrats disagree\nThose talking points are being used to discredit women and to weaponize this issue just simply for partisan gang attorney Deborah Katz\nSays she ran straight into it when she represented Kavanaugh's accuser Dr Christie blessing for we have the president deliberately muddying the facts to confuse people in that way giving people pass for engaging in the behavior and it's dangerous\nUltimately Katz says the backlash will fade with time the NPR Ipsos poll does show much more consensus among young people\nFewer of those under thirty five believe that too has gone too far fewer say they would ever consider voting for a political candidate accused of sexual misconduct and more young people said they're clear

ignore the context NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be refocusing more and its roots back here in Europe\nThe war games that they are staging right now has a NATO force\nThey are of NATO which is if one country is attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume this fictitious invader is Russia or an earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the eastern and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not

command in Naples, Italy and he said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic with a few hundred so we may be challenged and so uh if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nSo whatever all feel go saying is you know anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been from about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade limb to limb and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nYou're on falls it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right\nFor one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't stay well partly contracted\nTrump is so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find it cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below project\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China's system also considers information like when you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of lack list\nStacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast bring us this story about life on China's list of ... trustworthy\nPeople loved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China in one day he went online to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nThere you go out of it on our on our news says and this person is on the uh untrustworthy list from the court\nLoved one was confused why couldn't he broke the strength to get you started looking into the situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loud one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDream of one thing that comes along with the blacklist on customers they live for that uh you're fired from\nHigh end consumption which means that you can't take a speeding train you can fly\nChina started the block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans you couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud long went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face\nLike up on a big billboard\nOr not like you're more than be electric ... by the side of the\nPlaza there are like huge screens and they're very eye catching you can really see them from afar visit and I saw my my pictures on that screen it's like a picture of her on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is on trustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town she says whenever he went\nOut whenever he to the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nFor a lot of money ... oh my God this Orson we must be working in a semi industry as I did all know up their\nLoved one started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist you started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to you started\nBut what about what it was actually a friday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people will think why are you you're being happy widely used to have time to be happy\nOr why do you not to go out and make money to pay back your loan so far loud one says you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nSo still about one point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pass his that's getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked lawyers and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debts\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment\nLoud one says he will keep paying off his debt she has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR News\nSupport

small incision is in the abdomen where instruments are introducing through the abdomen through those ...\nRamirez and his colleagues decided to compare those two approaches six hundred women in total volunteered for this worldwide study overseers stop the study early after noticing a significant enterprising different\nPatients who underwent the minimal invasive surgery had four times greater

Harris NPR News\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's Halloween and the country is in full hunting season but the city of New Orleans has a reputation for being hunted all year round\nThis goes back to the Eighteen hundreds when a yellow fever virus wiped out tens of thousands of New Orleans Leah ... of NPR's Code switch team has our story if you get your

me\nIf you're more into the travel channel you might think it was all the swamps\nOh we're surrounded by water or somehow or to the very bizarre phenomenon we call goes\nThat if he were around between Eighteen Seventeen and Nineteen oh five there's a good chance you'd say New Orleans was haunted by death an epidemic years the yellow fever virus could wipe out up to ten percent of the city's population\nIt was spread by mosquitoes and in the summer of Eighteen fifty three it killed nearly eight thousand people\nThe virus earns New Orleans the nickname crop all this city of the dead and it wasn't a pretty way to die\nVictims experience John just so they sort of turned yellow\nThat's Katherine all the various she's a professor at Stanford who studies the history of yellow fever she says yellow fever would lead to chills Natasha headaches fever convulsions to leery\nHighest victims screen prevented these as the end neared\nAbout half of people who got yellow fever would die from it you might think all this death with keeping people away from New Orleans but actually people were flocking there all the various says it was like the antebellum Silicon Valley\nIt was a place where if you were an ambitious white man you went to make your fortune\nThat was because of slavery a cotton industry and New Orleans strategic location on the Mississippi River but all the various says that there were only a handful of people who made it in New Orleans\nMost people never able to break into those are the upper echelons of society and so you have people quite literally arriving in a death\nTrap today there is a vaccine for yellow fever but back then the only way to get immunity from the disease was to survive it cell there were tons of mess and misinformation floating around\nThat people who eat a lot of tomatoes will give a fever or people who eat too much free will get yellow fever\nAnd other widespread myth that you couldn't get yellow fever if he weren't black all the various says prominent doctors spread the lie that black people were naturally immune to the disease and she says that lie was used to justify slavery\nIf black people are naturally resistant to yellow fever therefore block slavery is natural even humanitarian because it protects white people from spaces and labor that would kill them\nBut here's the thing even if they didn't want to admit it many people knew that black folks weren't immune at slave markets few people were willing to buy a person who was an already acclimated to yellow fever\nSo you're dealing with the forty not of contradictions that all ended up furthering the cause of white supremacy and the expansion of racial slavery\nYellow fever it killed thousands terrified even more and it was a long standing tool of white supremacy how's that for her story\n...
