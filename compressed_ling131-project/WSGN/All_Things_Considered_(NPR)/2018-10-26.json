in Ann Arbor the national\nUnemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent that's a huge turnaround\nIt's loaded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd\nStanding here it's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last\nPeople to leave it was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary\nAnd you know crying all the way which are like losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here too yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over and I'm good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck [noise] current workplace\nPolicies that eighty thing again\nDon green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs\nThe thing this time of year than\nThey after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school\nSo she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ... did the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that\nWasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about her work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like ... son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was a tea do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all that as you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired I'm just living normal life but\nThat was not the case\nBeen in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were far north\nConcert or riding a

[noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something or you know the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gates since that\nDay [noise] draws a him six hurting the freeway with\nEnter our tour guide is Jeff Rob he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility\nThe site formerly known

dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWell the fear is a really suppressing reality the sides of the Honduran care than is reportedly dropped by half from some southern thousand thirty five hundred now and expected the fall even more the farther north it gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nLet me just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary cures to Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which if people forced their way across the border they could be shot at\nWinning not have any intention right now to ... to the phone they will be apprehended however uh that al ... officer an agent or at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious they didn't have any ability of course to defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico is ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private ranch land you got a call from another militia leader from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know when will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\n... we've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet a tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either at the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally\nNinety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number resort to more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase that's a huge growth how our border agents handling that [noise]\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go critics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse\n[noise] President Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details\nAbout that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban and he'll give his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas thanks to you about [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that historic an unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about it\nTwo percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing fast my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent that and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out and restaurants more Eli Maloof is America's CEO of I G the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and kept in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr set records are around our Labor Day an immoral David fear and fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for for trip spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just people who were spending more government spending was also up Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's reports there were some disquieting signs business investment spending\nGrew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number despite the big cuts in business taxes there was little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer realm you're starting to see some headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen business and consumer spending over time and they're already signs of weakness in the housing and car markets jacko also cites a gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia\nMeanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wean by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see somewhat slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nQuestion mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what ... calls are growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars\nUh but for now Americans are

group of navy seals has to rescue the kidnapped Russian President to World War three\nThe film hunter killer features some big names including Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman it was adapted from Birmingham author Don keeps novel firing line\nWhich he co wrote with George Wallace but not the form of Alabama governor keeps spoke with WBAI ... he says the books journey to the screen started with Wallace who's a former nuclear submarine captain and it was at a retired submariners meeting\nLittle cellar comes up and says I'm I'm a Hollywood producer and I'm looking for material about the sub or a movie at some questions for you along the way that you that he had written a book that was the national bestseller\nAnd the guy says I like to read it you did so this was not a movie what else you got well we just finished the manuscript that nobody wants to publish you want to read that sure Senate along two days later he says I'd like to uh\nWell he said it best he said if you sell your book to the movies cash the check and go away\nAnd I certainly understand that the good news for us is even though the book six hundred and Ninety two pages and they condense it down to two hour in one minute movie obviously they can't do the whole thing so they did leave out three other sub plots but they did stick primarily to the plot\nA big mistake a lot of authors make though is when they're writing that novel or that book they're thinking this will be a movie and they're thinking movie as they do that if you want to do that right a screenplay just tell a story\nHow concerned where are you about what that final product might look like\nWell we were concerned uh George obviously being a former submarine or he did not want to get ridiculed by his submarine or buddies\nBut it was also important to me and to him too that this be an accurate portrayal of what life is like on a submarine what a slice of the guys who are volunteer to\nTo do some rather interesting duty it's not quite as strenuous as it once was and I've written a lot about the old diesel submarines to in World War two and the Cold War\nBut it's still tough to do to your gone for six months at a time the nuclear submarines that were running right now can stayed out as long as they have enough food to feed the guys that's the limiting factor\nHave you had a chance to see the movie I'd only seen it on line on a

a novel or a non fiction book with the idea that this would make a movie and I'm going to do this because that's what will help sell it to the film industry\nI still think you have to just tell a story and to me the perfect story is\nAn average person who's placed in an unusual situation and who does remarkable things if you do that is going to work in a book is going to work in a short story

of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plan under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSeem ... yeah I'm sure it is crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nSick I get sick sickening\nThe thing when he started

would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field grew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nYou were married to ... when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that\nHum I at that point was used to being independent\nUsed to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about her work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift\nAt willow run when he was Eighteen you

militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol ...\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number resort to more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling math\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in

on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president it attempted what he attempted were to travel ban and he'll give that his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders\nNPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John Cuba [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers as historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing as fast as my like that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent that and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out in restaurants more Eli Maloof is America CEO of I G the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and camped in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr shut records around our Labor Day\nThey're spending more with us but it wasn't just consumers who are spending more government spending was also up\nCongress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number\nDespite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory Jaczko is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer rail you're starting to see them when the caring for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people and businesses over time and there are already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nJacko also site say gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see much slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what deco causing growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated\nThere's no telling what impact it will have but for now Americans are working in spending and that is keeping the growth rate strong Jim Zarroli NPR News [noise]\nYou're listening to all

sending more than a dozen package bombs across the United states the devices were address two prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThis morning FBI agents swarmed an auto zone parking lot in South Florida and arrested fifty six year olds ... or say Iraq that arrest came shortly after two more suspicious packages were identified as\nThe Justice Department news conference FBI Director Christopher Wray said the investigation is just beginning\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now so we need to help everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got to help with this investigation in the days to come\nAt the same news conference attorney general Jeff Sessions said the suspect

from member station W ELL RN in Miami she's been tracking developments today and joins us now from the site of the arrest and Katie first what else can you tell us about the suspect\nSo we know that say I was here this morning at this out of town just west of Fort Lauderdale any team any big white van full of stickers and very pro Republican anti liberal stickers and it's still not clear if he was an employee at this out of his own or if he was just a customer shopping\nOn the FBI agents swarmed the facility this morning right off the major highway and we're looking through the computer system and clashing employees here on auto zone does track customers by their cell phone number when they make a purchase\nSo FBI agents were here for a few hours looking through that the computer system\nSo that all went down this morning what does it seemed like now\nSo it's still a media frenzy here of course but I'm a little quieter the store's been closed for the rest of the day but a lot of customers have come up and try to come in and get things like oil for their cars and they've been pretty frustrating\nI saw the arrest happened uh because NYPD and FBI agents were sort of doing a stake out across the street with binoculars waiting for the moment to arrest sack\nRon Iverson you spoke with one of those witnesses today what did they tell you about what they're so\nI did I spoke with a businessman right across the street from the auto zone and and he knew he was telling me he knew pretty much right away\nWhen he saw NYPD an FBI agents that this was related to the suspicious packages and the pipe bombs mailed out this week um he he said he just had a got intuition that this was bigger than a small crime and he actually saw say space sent his expressions the moment he was arrested\nHe actually had a look on his face from what I saw um of him more of like just a okay they got me you know like you gave up kind of a thing like oh I Can't believe I Do this\n\nSupport for

Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Monday Night in the city of Flint people pulled up in their cars to the Asperger United Methodist church they slept in a long line of vehicles hoping to be near the front when volunteers started handing out pallets of bottled water at ten am Tuesday Morning\nThat's mine was like seven or eight blocks\nWe have about four to six hundred people to come to mind\n... Lewis Harris goes by miss Kay she coordinates this help center it's one of three that pop up in the city on different days of the week\nIn two thousand fourteenth the state switched Flint's water supply in an effort to save money water from the Flint River came out of people's taps looking brown and smelling like sewage government leaders at all levels told people the water was safe\nIt wasn't the improperly treated water corroded old pipes that leads to lead into faucets and showers kids were poisoned with lead the state provided free bottled water for two years until April and now after switching back to the original water supply the state once again says the tap water is safe to drink\nCompanies and charities donated these pallets of bottled water miss case says there isn't enough for everybody who lives up to get\nI'm really discouraged because this is only going for years and years and years [noise] um I have people that cry and it is\nAnd use the wider not to drink but to bang\nSo when you're cooking when you're brushing our teeth are still open and bottles of water\nAnd I've been doing it for years yeah does it just feel routine now or does it still feel like I Can't believe I'm doing this ball and when the government says look we've done the test there's a safe levels of lead it's okay you just don't believe it\nI Do not believe that trust is going to spend some time for everybody\nFlint's mayor supports her view arguing that the water won't be safe until all of Flint's corroded lead pipes have been replaced and the medical community signs off on it until that happens people are still lining up to get water wherever they can\nI guess it's something you have to live with it but now you know come on every week and get water you know\nLock in Milwaukee is Seventy two inching forward in his car I used to get my water delivered 'cause I was a senior they used to bring my water to let my my house you know it's heavy work lifting all those cases the

cities in the country more than forty percent of people here live below the poverty line it's also more than fifty percent black at this church pastor Rockville Dawson says the poison the water was just the latest setback\nThe water crisis was one more thing on top of a whole lot that this communities had to deal with the disinvestment some jobs going away and so this was like almost the straw that broke the camel's back you know in a lot of ways but we're resilient you know the people here are strong and we keep keep moving forward [noise]\nSome of the workers digging up the media and here are wearing bright yellow vests that say city of Flint fast to start with an image of a ranch and the faucet they've been at this for years and they are nowhere near or close to replacing all of the pipes that need to be dug out\nRight now I think we are either Seventy five percent complete on a cell hours to service line replacements\nJeff grader is project manager for WTC Stevens construction one of the companies the city has contracted to dig up the pipes but when he says they're Seventy five percent done he's only talking about the service lines between the house and the street\nHe's not including piped in people's houses or the water mains under the road\nThere's still quite a bit\nIn terms of when you can totally close the book and same mission accomplished\nGood question [laughter] we are\nThis home for your system I grew up here\nHow personal as this job for a very personal I grew up on the north or in my entire family lives here in\n... does your family have tough

saying Flint's water has tested safe for more than two years in the Michigan governor's race both candidates have talked about Flint on the campaign trail everybody we talk to in the city rolled their eyes at\nThat is a great soundbite let's see what happens after November six\nThis is Jeanette McDonalds I first met her almost three years ago when ... was making national headlines for the water crisis we've been checking in with her regularly as she and her husband raised two boys in the city\nToday they use bottled water that they buy to cook and brush their teeth they use filters on the shower debate when I went to their house this week it was the first time I'd heard Jeanette express a little bit of hope her older son justice had a skin condition the last time we were here\nHas eczema his flare ups are not as frequently and when they do come they're not as bad as they used to be\nI remember when we were here the first time you said you were known for your long\nHair yeah and it started coming out when you moved in the water yeah and it's growing longer now he has it has this almost my shoulders now\nJustice was six when we first met him now at age nine he's smart and curious he listens carefully to our interview with his mother and then jumps in\nThe ... what's your question why does the ... the others they they don't\nWell it wasn't that our pipes broke ... what happened was uh\nShe goes into along fact based explanation about the state government's decision to change water sources in an effort to save money and later when we were alone she says that question from her son really through her\nTo the first time asking me that ever and that kinda now with a lot\nIs it hard to know what to say it is it is and especially ... my emotions because I don't you know I just want to break down in front of them because they not understand why she so upset\nWhat's the answer that you would have given to that question is has not been asked by one of your children\nAre probably honestly\nAnd who cares I feel like is is is pretty much where the nation is right now you see\n[noise] [noise]\nYou see\nYoung black boys getting murder by white police officers all across the nation so what do I think as a black mother raised in a black boys how do I think a government that's predominantly white how do they they show me what they feel about me in us here has led they shoulder\nEvery well I Want to say racism is not alive it is so alive and it's so sad and I you know it's hard not\nTo [noise] teach your\nKids about it without sounding races you know what I mean I don't want my children the hate anyone because of the color of their skin I I just I Want to be careful when I'm answering things for him because I Want him to be an adult that's able to change the world\nOn one level this story in Flint is about water\nBut on another level it's about trust in government feeling like your voice matters and that elected leaders care about your pipes are hard to fix those other things or even harder\n\nThis is NPR News\n[noise]\n... this is your NPR station Ninety point three WB ate him Birmingham and one oh four point five of them in Fort Paine
