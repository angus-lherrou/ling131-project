who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nOr can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these ...\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts it seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor in prominent Trump critic Robert Deniro had received one of the packages ... at an address link to him in New York\nAnother common denominator is that these ...\nSo the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation authorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA ever had the potential to explode and ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way\nThey're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI is assistant director William Sweeney says that powder and at least some of these on gloves does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says\nBut the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them\nAnd did that was that happening for political or personal reasons all of that as a big focus of this investigation or two if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them\nWhoever did made her part of the story and there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida besides the FBI and the ATF\nPostal service investigators are involved here to trying to trace that and a postal service representative has just told us and the last eight hours or so they've seen known new packages run through the system and just briefly carry while this person or persons are still on those\nGood afternoon it's three twenty\nSupport for NPR comes from the

the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border that\nWe're going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an interest partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and whether as there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I Know they'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year\nFlood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a company children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de the northern ... countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I hurt a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was the one that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than Central American immigrants and we've been tracking that now true for you it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed to we're dealing with\nTens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of cordless\nIn this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with you a President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it it's a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the laws so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask\nYou the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison hand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest German homeland security most of these laws are under my means jurisdiction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because there's this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would\nA problem solver gather the information find the agreement in our community we you know we all agree what to secure the border that we have to have reasonable silent standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and then we don't separate families so\nTry to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and turning like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its feel competing narratives

of the FBI is New York office William Sweeney gave an update on the investigation to reporters today\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nNPR's Hansi Lo Wang has been reporting on the investigation from New York City and ... where does the investigation stand at this point into these packages\nOr you have a really a full force of law enforcement trying to figure out why this happened who was behind this uh this includes the FBI then my pd also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages are found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd of course when I tried to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out\nLooking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York office or the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any ...\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nExplosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing an investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now well\nOne big question is were these packages sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by a cure your\nAnd also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise] uh firearms a division and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who is the individual or individuals' behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York\nWill the baggage is in New York as we mentioned earlier was were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden and Newcastle county Delaware and there was one baggage that was sent to the business office of Robert De Niro here in Manhattan and what's really interesting is actually found by a retired cop\nWas working for um Mr De

owes a bigger apology to folks have color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co hosted today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and it's nice and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refuse to defenders well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly as his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to her own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in a twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings uh and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much beloved\nBe very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC\nShe displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd A L rogue gr at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for ah ah for this thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office that's\nNPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they are definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round um we do every year uncouth which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween is likely to Christmas at all companies and this one day of the year when all the ... costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to Mr all shows on which why people would dress up like by people I talked to in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's missile shows depicted black people was lazy as animal is to play on caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad the human disease and that allows slavery to happen at the time and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black\n\n\nSo there's a whole history of you know read these portrayals of Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's\nFace always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured were often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people in this bill shows who are not wearing black race because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... [noise] to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history ... what do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance is not a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white piano which is important\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up and black face and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about so those broader context we always start in historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when these controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations will be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black base\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently\nProminent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ...\nThank you so much Mary Louise the silver [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise] this is NPR News\nThere is an oil boom in ...

businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places\nTo make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to Central America\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have\nOn doors in Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them to do\nNow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end\nIt is the responsibility of the Central

Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington the attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these ...\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nThey include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor in prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the packages ... at an address link to him in New York\nAnother common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a or had the potential to explode them here you are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI's assistant director William Sweeney says that powder in at least some of these on bulbs does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and ...\nHazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them\nAnd did that was that happening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation or two if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida remember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story\nAnd there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida besides the FBI and the ATF\nPostal service investigators are involved here to trying to trace that and a postal service representative has just told us and the last eight hours or so they've seen known new packages run through the system and just briefly carry while this person or persons are still on the loose\n\nIt's five twenty support for NPR comes from the station and from log me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform allowing people to connect around the globe to get work

Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you\n... are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border which as you know President Trump is calling a national\nEmergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for it\nExactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I Know they had called her national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year\nFlood of individuals coming from Central America is on a company children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here\nOur legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de\nThe northern ... countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was the one that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than Central American immigrants and we've been tracking that now ... it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds who is opposed we're dealing with\nTens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual apps who of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had that I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were\nSome effect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this current event might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish it\nYou know but but let me just before we move on from this ask\nYou the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a president Rand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what ever read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of our products German homeland security most of these laws are under my major's diction we've gotta do to my community leaders diction because there's this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would\nBe a problem solver gather the information find areas of agreement in our community we you know we all agree want us to the border that we have to have reasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and then we don't separate families so\nTry to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for

D. also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages are found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York office\nOr the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nExplosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing an investigation or asking\nFor tips from the public are there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now well one\nIs were these packages sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by a cure your and also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who\nIf they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York\nWill the baggage is in New York as we mentioned earlier was were sent to vice president former vice president Joe Biden Newcastle county Delaware and there was one baggage that was sent to the business office of Robert De Niro here in Manhattan\nAnd what's really interesting is actually found by a retired cop was working for um Mr De Niro production company and he spotted it after noticing very similar resemblance to photos of packages found earlier this week and he called in a cold that tip into the bomb squad New York city police orange bomb squad they came in and

and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\n[noise] show I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David Hey already so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... show she was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panels about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on or a black person and puts on white fade away like a kid that was okay as long as you were dressed like a character\nAnd that of course a tapping into a rich being a pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story\nOnly African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show or a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from El wrote her a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteenth or he's minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co host of today's show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and it's nice and junior as soon as it's it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany any lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refuse to defenders well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly as his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to her own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she'd insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and A L wrote her a\nAt that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for ah ah for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box\nAnd it's on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they are definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween now I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round eroded um we do every year in ... which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween is is Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical literacy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying blackface and America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds or may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people I talked to in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missiles shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad the human condition that allow slavery to happen at the time and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century algae Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black face [noise]\n[noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read these patrols of Native Americans and yellow face betrayal of Asian American the right of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against us\nAnd to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured were often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles who are not wearing black race because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history ... what do you make of that [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense none of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white and I went to the port and she seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who made\nBecome conversations about intent and not about the broader context we always start in a store or vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because there was a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there's not a black person in attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery and so maybe these conversations will be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen\nThank you so much Mary Louise the next like silver [laughter] I Hope not [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nAnd the next fresh air corruption scandal and greed in college basketball\nWithout with Microsoft love about what he calls the buying and selling of basketball

evening from seven to eight o'clock on WBAL gym\n[noise]\nSeventy ... this is your NPR station Ninety point three WB H in Birmingham and one oh four point five lesson in Fort Paine [noise]\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life\nNorth what about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end\nUm but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to Central America\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now\nTransnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them you\nKnow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and in ...\nIt's to protect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out this ancient part of the brain may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of did it functions Scott in America post doc and doesn't bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seems effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks as the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nWe're already thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's\nDid then your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist had been missing for a long time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum is changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Sarah but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved in cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nMom and says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have a link to cerebellum\nAnd smiles and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News
