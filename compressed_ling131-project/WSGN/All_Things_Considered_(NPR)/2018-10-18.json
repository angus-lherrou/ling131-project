Hassan call as well as the police chief general Abdul rustic general Miller took command of us and NATO troops just six weeks ago the Taliban said he was the target\nMiller spokesman tweeted that Afghan officials were the targets and the wounded including an American soldier a contractor along with the coalition contractor were caught in the crossfire you said all were listed in stable condition\nTolo news local media group reported that Miller was on his way to his helicopter after the meeting when at least one of the governor's bodyguard open fire\nOfficials say the attacker or attackers were killed\nThe attack comes a day after the Taliban killed a political candidate in the case in Helmand Province the latest in dozens of targeted attacks a number of polling stations around the country will not open because of security problems\nKandahar has been relatively calm for years mostly due to the efforts of police chief general rustic\nA brutal enforcer who had a network of informants he survived numerous Taliban assassination attempts and it's also been accused of many human rights abuses including torture and summary executions\nNPR sat down with ... three years ago when there was talk he would be sidelined for the alleged abuses\nWhen it has to be thought Americans would stop providing him with ammunition fuel and equipment he brushed all that aside\n... are they going to do it that way about what we are doing in this country is for law enforcement\nUS military officials have tried for years to get ... who's tough ways but were quick to point out that he was necessary to keep the Taliban away from the American base Kandahar Airfield\nAnd today general Miller the U.S commander called ... a great friend the good he did for Afghanistan in the Afghan people Miller said\nCannot be undone Tom Bowman NPR News Washington\nA long time listener you think should be pushing but who hasn't and you did for example Nineteen year old Kathleen watching turned in her own mother\nBecause I'm In my house we've always listen to NPR all the time it's always on my kitchen in our car in our bathrooms\nAs soon as she was old enough to have a credit card company pledged and then she was surprised to find out her parents the ones whose objected to public radio in the first place did not\nSo uh and it's I've kinda been on them to do it and I don't think I'll do it eventually or it's kind of disappointing because she always sort of taught me to\nLike give back as much as I can so I'm so is your mom they're young they go grab her sitting on my grandma [laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nMomma [noise]\nNo phone for you [noise] ada [noise]\nOkay so her mom gets on the phone with me and explain that her daughter turned her in for pledge drive Justin and

tuned into WB a chance now it's time to do that with your dollars one eight hundred for for for nine two four six is the number we're waiting for your call we're waiting for you to step up and support public radio for the heart of Alabama\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district it is deeper ed and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year's deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump\nHow do you view the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews\nThe mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year near where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nLove is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly what I'm working with I build ... relationship on both sides of the aisle love as aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately\nHe's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that has stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that something McAdams keeps pointing out saying that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi and that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift they are calling for single payer health care or impeachment\nSo if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power guy Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city [noise]\n\nAnd you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nHi I'm David

B. A. Jim dot org and when you do thank you [noise]\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nNews this week that Sears is bankrupt has prompted much ringing of hands over the bleak future of the American mall\nBut while some malls are emptying out others are bustling according to the international council of shopping centers over the last five years more malls have opened and closed mark going as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all those Sears stores shutting down\nThere or triple boys or super regionals as they are referred to who are booming who are receiving\nIn business and in their facility they're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully talented and there were only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor star but they've got others can what would they do it to share space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of headed food offerings things of that sort of ... and then there are B and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older\nIn many cases they've already lost his ears\nAnd the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the ... why can't they re imagined the space and add a food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can't manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are striving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type lay out that his working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what those look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community\nSo they're typically the biggest shiny is penny in the marketplace in virtually every major population centers throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA centers that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined in what ways where if you will an anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nWill the Akron store was typically a department store and the department stores genre is for the most part on his way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined\nUh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nFor a mall is probably outmoded as well and many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store my which doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center [noise]\nDo you go shopping malls regularly\nNo fly when I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United states and Canada\nBut frankly um they're they're less and less attractive they offer less and less appeal and I've gravitated like millions and millions of other folks to the Internet which is I'm much more a convenience obviously and much more likely to be successful\nAnd smart Cohen at Columbia Business school he was former CEO of Sears Canada Mr Khan thanks very much\nYou bet thank you\nI have a question for you [noise] how do you decide what has value I'm Guy Raz host of radio hour from NPR and on our show we recently looked at the idea of value and why it is we like the things would be like\nI think in general are our experiences or modulated not just by our senses but by our beliefs this is Paul bloom I'm a professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University and a lot of\nHis work is focused on how human beings decide what's valuable in what is\nSomeone isn't mistaken when they pay extra money for the better known brand because it might lead to extra pleasure but but how do we decide I mean how do we decide what has value so he could value things for different reasons you value them because of their utility\nOr what they could do for you you know so golf clubs can you play golf with them um you\nKnow a suit you could wear but things get value in other ways as well and often they get value because of their history and so we we get pleasure\nFrom sometimes from knowing what something is\nAnd knowing where it came from [noise]\nAnd our experiences transformed in that way [noise]\nSo if we like is affected by what we believe than I have another question for you [noise] do you value what\nYou hear in public radio every day do you believe that brings richness to your life do you listen and learn new things about human behavior in science and the economy but if your answer is yes then please show your support like contributing today your presence your support\nAnd things you\nCan do that right now

moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIt is a deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports in this year's deep\nHow do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews\nThe mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year near where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need\nTo win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist\nGoing into Washington I Know exactly why I'm working with I build ... relationship on both sides of the aisle\nLove is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nIs also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out saying that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi\nI even say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house McAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift they are calling for single payer health care or impeachment\nSo if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderate ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power guy Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city\n\nAnd you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n[noise] [noise] Hi

spoke to in that central square as she was cradling her exhausted five year old son on her lap\nGay on it as a family thing to get us nothing I must say what he does\nWhat she said is that there's no

this\nUh whatever paperwork comes along with that the people in the caravan just do not have that uh so it's very unlikely that many of the people in the ... are going to meet that requirement from the Mexican government and then the Mexican government went on to say that if people wanted to request asylum in Mexico they could but they would do that from a detention center\nAnd then if anyone tried to cross illegally they'd be detained and deported back to their home country\nAs you talk to these people and I mentioned to the U.S is threatening to revive the family separation policy again
