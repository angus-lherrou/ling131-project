I mean he's a he worked in London in two thousand and seven I'm as an intelligence officer for the Boston or their um we understand from the lease or information published by the Washington Post as well that\nHe um he went under once I'm training as an intelligence officer or a security officer\nAnd he's been he's been photographed the princess side on visits this year to the U.S to Houston to Boston to the U.N General assembly I mean that was just three weeks ago\nThat's right I mean he's on his shoulder at all these places as you know the crown prince is\nGoing on this tour of the u._s. scorching business and government leaders and uh yeah he's he's there ... playing with him he's sitting in the or standing in the in the United nations\nUm he's a in Houston in a neighborhood that was I'm devastated by floods says as opposed to the Saudis\nNo denial needs to know each other as this is why I'm certainly not designed it you know voter those yeah you've also identified a forensic doctor who specializes in autopsies this is another person who Turkish officials say was part of this hit squad\nThe presence of a forensic doctor who specializes in autopsies that would make it awfully hard to deny that there was lethal intent from the beginning of the separation right\nUse you make this station give now one eight hundred for for for nine two four six step up to the challenge again a new member challenge is happening\nRight now give us a call one eight hundred for for for nine two four six you've been calling on day asking when's the next challenge well it's right now\nYou can give on line right now at W. B. H M dot org and when you do thank you\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the state by saying yes I did smoke a joint or I have smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible reporters posed many scenarios\nDecisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use ... welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law\n... going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing it at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of culture bad on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally and Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much [noise]\nShakespeare wrote all the world's a stage and all the men and women ... plans but oh you merely a player [noise] nothing wrong

H M dot org and when you do thank you [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro the U.S turkey and Saudi Arabia or each maneuvering as more information comes out about the disappearance of Saudi journalist here's what happened today Turkey's foreign minister said he wants more cooperation from Saudi Arabia\nUs secretary of state Mike Pompeo met with Turkey's president and said the Saudis are committed to a full transparent investigation Pompeo was in Saudi Arabia yesterday\nAlmost daily leaks from the Turkish government strongly indicate that Jamal ... G was murdered NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us now from Istanbul Hi Peter hey Ari tell us what's been happening today with ... visit to turkey just today after he was in Saudi Arabia\nRight well this was billed as a fact finding mission and the Turks seemed pleased that Washington is showing not just in involved in here but support for Turkey's investigation\nOr there was a delay in searching the consul general's residence the Saudi consul general's residence er and that's what caused the foreign minister to say we need some more cooperation here but that surge then did begin today\nA Pompeo told reporters that the administration is not going to get ahead of the investigations and draw conclusions but he denied the U.S would downplay or gloss over the killing of a journalist if that's what happened here's what he said\nI'm not I'm not going to speculate that obviously if someone\nCountry gauges an activity that is a lawful is\nNope no one is going to defend\nBut Palmdale at the same time make clear that the church should be mindful of the many important partnerships that bind to us in Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump is said much the same thing\nThat there have been some new details coming out today about what happened in that consulate and we should warn listeners that some of these details are graphic tell us what this investigation has revealed\nAnd Saudi investigators did enter the consul general's residence today with Saudi permission continuing their search of Saudi diplomatic buildings in property a the constantly building was surge Monday and apparently evidence was found pointing\nSaudi diplomatic vehicles but to get your point a pro government newspaper has published a very graphic details of the torture and killing allegedly of Mr ... including him having his fingers cut off before he was killed and the forensics expert putting on music to drown out the sound of the dismembered into the body\nOr no it's not clear how long are the Turkish investigation or the Saudi internal investigation into that matter will go on a secretary of state Pompeo today said we should give them a handful of days to get this over with sooner is better than later he said\nIt's all on the one hand the Turks say they have audio recordings of what happened on the conflict on the other hand the Saudis are claiming to have had nothing to do with it can those two narratives really get resolved in these investigations wrapped up and just a few days\nThat is not at all clear I mean there are some suggestions that this would have to be a quite a long investigation to resolve the dispute like that and there's been no timetable given on this and a President Trump today did say a ... we should know what happened to the show gee by the end of the week or whether that will actually happened we just have to wait and see\nAnd what about the international response is there any kind of an organized punishment or condemnation of Saudi Arabia for the growing evidence that it was involved in this killing of a U.S resident journalist\nIt's time to stop taking public radio for granted we're here for you each and every day now is your chance to step

marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where\nI had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and\nDecisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nBe crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation and less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\nHe's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might\nSome of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing you wrote out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage or say come as somebody is trying to get in in the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point 'cause everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I said everything was going to be OK\nIrwin last doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road\nHigh winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time in Britain see management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle in many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I called the Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state in some north Florida communities new construction need only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes\nFlorida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael impact\nWhat we saw were damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not cabbage houses that were well educated\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah it does for back in now particularly yet Michael back it is going to force a much higher global warming or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now the process of revising the state code and his wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David per bought ... says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can you talk it has to be proven it the researchers there it is the way the community is willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors homebuilders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as

H M good evening at six thirty\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered Kate thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats in ... city and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experience\nAnd one of ... students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that a decision is based on I think Harvard saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that\nIt is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents are mission for group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal reading to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were scoring higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in the case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans\nAlmost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court on a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI Do think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of\nThe ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea so\nI think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that\nMarriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are\nJust disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWell ... thank you so much for
