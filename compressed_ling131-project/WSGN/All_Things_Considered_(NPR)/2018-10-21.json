Martin we're going to return to a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party and he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it\nThanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie bossy Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony\nAnd I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never\nAnd so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody all of a sudden a kids came up there and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nSo about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching\nAnd as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off\nAnd then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on his than any one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on his shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other parts of the party started touching another young woman who was also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nThis was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched\nWhat about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault [noise]\nBut you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you\nJust heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerate it so long\nI I I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I\nHad a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it [noise]\nHow did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my participation she didn't know that to this article came out ...\nLet me just say it's a it was tough for her to take let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with them and uh they were very receptive [laughter] you know I'm their dad you know dad can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids\nAre they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it that's what they too\nThat doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they\nYeah we film everything you know what they would kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your\nChest you know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings\nI'll be honest there there are days when\nI regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone ... it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this a lot of women ah said ah\nThey were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a assaulted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you\nKnow your piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could quote but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say the only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh\nYou know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if I were to help these women then but I didn't do it\nDumps hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend shriek Adams\n[laughter]\nCould Ruth was acquitted of first degree murder and supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planning the murder carried out by a hit man she was able to deliver the child named chancellor but she died weeks later\nCould Ruth was sentenced to more than two dozen years in prison but with time served he's scheduled to be released tomorrow from Sampson correctional institution in Clinton North Carolina\nScott Fowler has been covering the story for nearly two decades with the Charlotte Observer and he's just released a seven part report in a pod cast about Ruth the murder and the aftermath it's called careers and Scott ... is with us now from Charlotte Scott thanks so much for talking with his thank you so much for having me on the show\nAuthorize his attorney to speak with you it's my understanding from your reporting that to this day he's still denies that he was planning a murder he says it was a drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a coward not a killer that he thought that van ... trying to kill him\nAnd he left the scene but that he didn't do anything about is that about right\nYes van Brett Watkins was the hit man that proof hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shootings sort of situation\nAnd group yes I have spoken to him on the phone for about twenty minutes but off the record so it helped inform my reporting some but\nIt was ultimately his attorney who who are most recently spoke to for the the pod cast that's exactly what he says it was violent retribution van ...
