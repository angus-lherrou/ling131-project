American pastor Andrew Brunson\nFriends than had been detained in Turkey for two years for months President Trump and others in his administration has been working on his release today pastor Brunson arrived in the U.S and appeared in the oval office with President Trump\nI just want to congratulate you because view of yellow just go\nAnd talk more about how has released came about and what this means for the U.S turkey relationship we're joined now by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him hey can you start by describing the scene in the oval office this afternoon\nYet so you had President Trump seated in the middle next to him a was a pastor Brunson and his family on the other side there were senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo all who had worked to secure\nFor instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president\nAnd prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom well what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\n... air to one uh he had been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the states\nIt was moved in July to house arrest then that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August to impose sanctions on turkey to try to force the release of Brunson um that released came on friday a and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes this mean anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nYou know these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be a pretty good report between President Trump and president air to one uh though Trump set it on a number of occasions that this situation with pastor Brunson was hurting their relationship I'm\nIn the oval office today and also on Twitter President Trump insisted that there was no deal involved here\nUh in securing Branson's release a but he did say that it would likely improve the relationship between the two nations you know this comes at a time when the U.S and turkey are trying to figure out how to navigate the disappearance and suspected murder of journalists ...\nUm he wrote for the Washington Post and was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in his stumble up almost two weeks ago\nAnd we're going to talk more about that later in the program but first what are the domestic political implications of the brands and release\nPastor Brunson case was really important to evangelical Christians who took a keen interest in securing his release a and evangelicals are a key part of President Trump's base and one other thing about this that stands out is that\nPresident Trump has really put a priority on freeing Americans who are held overseas it's an aspect of international relations that he's put a real emphasis on\nDo\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from love me in makers of go to

secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivists they're suing can because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this so we called up mark nice ... he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nPassed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if you are name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays\nThese potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to um put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law\nAnd so now we're in round two where the civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that dislike disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case steal\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nRain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas and voting system does he have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to be his opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process that secretary of state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on pending lists and we have seen Georgia Pass a photo ID law before you can vote however\nAt the elections and enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of the election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easier to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we recorded a Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just since the may primary election what's\nThe mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on voting\nRights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that Brian Kemp used\nThat was mark ... of the Atlanta Journal constitution mark thanks so much\nFor thank thank you\nNow it's time for the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds and today we're going to talk about a couple of celebrities who got political this week you know I Love\nEveryone but have had I was making you know the guy that he didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy that his late ... was\nIt was something about when I put\nAnd made me feel like super ...\nYou probably heard those comments from Kanye West in the oval office and the firestorm of reaction after but Kanye wasn't the only celebrity catching heat this week Taylor Swift was to for her Instagram endorsement of two Democrats running for office in Tennessee her home state\nAnd we've got a few people joining us to talk about this\nTest is Stewart is a politics reporter at Rolling Stone she's in Hudson New York Julia ... of the huff post is on the line from Washington D. C. and last but not least Rodney Carmichael from NPR Music is joining us via Skype from Atlanta [noise]\nHey everybody who was the guy he has it gone right now I'm going to start with you because I Know at some point you were a big ... fan maybe you still are\nUm and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this was on another level and it was in the oval office [noise]\nWhat was your reaction to what went down on Thursday it was so\nI Would love for once upon a time you noticed hours ... has been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the per year was not that much of a surprise but as easy as it is to kind of laugh about it and imagine some kind of entertaining\nBring I think we've got a seriously up and just really dangerous because the ... that he is now and I I feel like in a lot or waves he's a reflection of Trump as a candidate in twenty foods scene and it was really easy to laugh about 'em into election you know\n... ... what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously\nYes if you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not doing this to be provocative he's not doing this to sell albums\nIt's very clear at least to me that this is how he feels um he\nEven said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reach\nHe has fans his fans follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\nBecause I'm going to throw this next question to you Taylor Swift also got some heated reaction to her backing to Democrats in Tennessee up for people who haven't heard\nTests that can you can you tell us what happened what she did on Sunday night she posted a photograph of herself to Instagram and and the caption she talked about the fact\nThat she was coming out for the first time and vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee and Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November but the main thrust of her answer and post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate in the race she said she likes to support\nWomen who are running for office but she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that black friend has supported in Congress um she said they're not hurt Tennessee values\nHigh profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh\nAnd get a reaction but it wasn't as strong as for instance Trump has been to criticism in the past\nHe said I like Taylor's music twenty five percent less now\nUm which is really like not that damning of a of a combination and makeup and he said you know she's entitled to her political beliefs but it's not going to matter and less Thirteen year old girls are voting which was very dismissive of um Taylor's reach which is a lot broader than just Thirteen year old girls at this point\nBut what about her her fans who are Republicans just regular fans not high profile\nYeah it's hard to say because the timing of this announcement was right after her reputation tour and dead so we don't have a sense of whether this would impact\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines President Trump congratulated American pastor

considered from NPR News I'm ... you know one one in place that in the future a British sociology professor lectures her students about the sex industry\nYeah of course men was having sex as well as you'll remember from the reading what white and male slots cold like they were called ...\nThat Sarah Jones she's the Tony Award winning playwright and started the show sell by date and which he inhabits Nineteen different characters a sex worker from Trinidad a former pen from South central LA and an elderly Jewish woman from flushing queens\nWhat are you at Twenty years old age\nThe use of my God I think I can do in my purse [laughter]\nAnd Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us and we're out of here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most\nWith all of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of pimp types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women who's a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never up while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst than value are determined by\nParents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOf the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know the it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and\nYou know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... or is just sort of burn more but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex is as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who\nI was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accident which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually it just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then present it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working out some of this ... ... the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex ... prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but he got cracking good job\nOr she is a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that chief it in ... so you know I really try to vet my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American in German\nLet's say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter] but you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like well what is it which is and you talk white you this do that yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about her place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure are pleasure\nAnd finally today we're going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America and then our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us\nHe spent the first twelve years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and when I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was an identity crisis\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational adoptees together\nThe narrative about my adoption was really centered around my mom being a savior\nMy language my mannerisms my experiences are all in foreign by the white family I grew up with you told us you feel alone and want to know if there are other people like you out there\nYou asked us if you were a bunch of polls are those are yours and ours by\nTrying to claim identities that you weren't exposed to when you were growing up",
