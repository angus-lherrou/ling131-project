B. a gym don't or\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin broadcasting today from member station W H y y in Philadelphia we're here because we wanted to spend some time today talking about the mid term elections which are just a few days away\nBut we're going to begin our program with news of another horrific mass shooting this time at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nEleven people died at least six people were injured according to officials a public safety official in the city describe the synagogue as a horrific crime scene President Trump addressed the shooting at a political event this afternoon and said federal authorities have been dispatched help to help investigate he condemned the shooting as a wicked act of mass murder\nThe vial hate filled voice of anti Semitism must\nBe condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere fears\nThere was no tolerance for anti Semitism in America\nFor for any form of religious or racial hatred for prejudice\nReporter Sarah Schneider of member station W E S H is covering this tragedy and she is with us now Sara thanks so much for talking with us I think if what we know about the identity of the victims police officers and we know were among the wounded can you tell us anymore\nDon't know anything about we haven't identified the eleven people who were killed today we know that none of the people who were killed were children we do know that they were sick and injured victims and a chill the injured victim or a sixty one year old female Seventy year old now and then uh\nOfficers can you tell us a bit more about the synagogue and the community where this happened\nYet the synagogue is in um squirrels hill it's that this vibrant you know active Jewish community in Pittsburgh and um today when I was on the scene we saw you know many people who were concerned about\nFriends and family members who they knew were in the building that day uh this morning and a lot of people just confused trying to figure out where those people were\nCan you tell us a bit more about the alleged gunman and I understand but he was taken into custody alive\nYeah we do know the government is alive he's in fair\nCondition with a gunshot wound um that the director of a public safety and Pittsburgh says he believes to be from police officers they haven't given any other um details about this person but we do know that\nUh there will they they assume that you know chargers will come down possibly today\nCan you tell us a bit more about what type of weapon or weapons he used and can you tell us any more about how long it took to subdue him\nOut we know that he had three handguns and an assault rifle but it is unclear if he used all of them in the shooting um we were told he's been in the building he was into buildings day for about twenty minutes and ... he was\nExiting the synagogue um officers confronted him and that's when the two swat officers were injured um than he retreated into the building\nYou know how many people were in a synagogue at the time and if there were any security guards posted and the reason I raise that is that President Trump rejected the idea that this has anything to do with gun laws but he said that if the synagogue had had an armed guard inside the gum and could have been stopped so can you tell us any more about that yeah

broadcasting today from WHYY in Philadelphia we are of course following the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh today\nWe will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia\nYou may have hurt other colleagues some NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now\nVisiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump into thousands sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty\nMore cuts thought what secure the White House for them and all of the states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house because we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's and they're on what's on their minds this election year help us understand but we've been hearing we asked WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and\nThank you so much for hosting us and thanks to all the people who offered us pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and allies say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state I mean for the last six years Pennsylvania's ... have had congressional maps that\nWere pretty bizarrely shaped and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis will challenge last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not a federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map and unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big theme is playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed a tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has\nIn the country in a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he poured millions of dollars on his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary you're not just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations\nAnd away from the Ninety nine percent but just a moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid in this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America\nAnd destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI on our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and\nAll very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here the ... on a specific level the big issues you're our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that\nAll of this together is money in politics\nMy opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate pac money I refuse to take a dime he's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money on this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business\nFrom getting done and I think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests\nStops every single thing that the people want\nYou know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district on expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations\nBlessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voices going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big is a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nIs huge I mean I I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone still he's not on the ballot\nBut is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in uh in part a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nHe goes around the country singer vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election\nAnd of course interest is much higher and a presidential election and the reality is this is the first chance to voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is Trump doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things that's got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that well\nScott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars on his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative and most of it\nAnd what about the Trump factor we talked about that is is is that the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about they might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nOr the feeling that that Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo as we said Democrats got while it is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian Fitzpatrick fitzpatrick is the former FBI agent the only form an FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also going\nAnd the two thousand sixteen elections accomplishments Patrick invited us to meet him at his parent's house in the suburb of ... town where he grew up as the youngest of eight siblings and despite being the beneficiary of a lot of the so called independent expenditures the deepest just talked about\nFlowing into the race on whose behalf fitzpatrick said that he agrees with his Democratic opponent that there's too much money in politics\nI could not agree more that money in politics is the problem I was a supervising the FBI's political corruption unit\nIn April of two thousand and one of the Citizens United decision came down Bob Mueller's my boss I got called up I had to speak to him about this issue is question was what is this going to do door corruption cases unless it's or it's going to increase the corruption because money's the root of all evil money in politics is the root of all corruption cases\nEdu\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines authorities in Pittsburgh continue to search for a motive and the shooting at a synagogue this morning that left at least eleven people dead\nForty six year old Robert powers has been arrested authorities say he was injured and is hospitalized shooting is being investigated as a hate crime\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis is in

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Brian Tyler\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point [noise]\nAh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today or here's what he had to say but how does this\nThis vehicle is social media\nAnd his movements over the last several days are Jones says officers recovered an assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are going to search is home they say that they'll take precautions in case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point or that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but that of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has call this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges or in this case he says that there's no place for hatred of violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but\nWe're gonna have to wait and see what all those ... charges are going to entail\nCould just tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight in in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been using in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it is such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as briefly as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there\nUh there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiment a and the alleged shooter in this\nRyan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race and pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility\nThey told us they hope for more unity\nAnd that is a message that might have special resonance in Gettysburg the site of an epic civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three one of the country's bloody is we're more than fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there had been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics fats and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded a group and twenty Seventeen Darcy Meyer also a Democrat joined a group through her friendship with Thompson and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty six team in previous years before that was very politically involved I was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways and\nUh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the oil\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who have been calling for something like this lawyer John cases in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could do the same arguments however as a ... a former governor of Pennsylvania for sex homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car came up with a structure for that Darcy what about you is this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no I really\nI um I have always done a pretty staunch Democrat I that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive I never really\nRealizing that that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find\nIs has just been a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nI was hoping that we could come to understand each other more\nAnd I I'm very convinced as Darcy just said\nThat there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue voter but I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the\nStory of the blind men and the the elephant\nWhich um I don't know if you're familiar with Philip ... book expert political judgment in which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view\nThe more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example\nSo Darcy not that you were saying I don't want to talk to those people many but um [laughter] what you do is I'm hungry for this experience as others were what made you finally decide to come while at we're\nReally was cars invitation and cars and courage meant that got me to come to the group\nAnd then it was the surprise at the civility as a conversation that made me stay I tend to be a fairly quiet person who doesn't express myself very well in a group situation and so\nI don't like the idea of going into a place where there's going to be arguing and fighting and and I feel like I'm going to just shut down I Will just shut down\nShow this kind of environment where everybody is expected to have something to say\nReally helped me and knowing that people were not going to argue with me or shut me down\nChat here's where I I have to impose upon our new friendship and put you on the spot sure because for a lot of people I think on the left but also a lot of people who are just", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018",
