G disappeared nearly two weeks ago after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTurkey says he was killed by a Saudi ... team will today Turkish on Saturday investigators finally searched the consulate\nNPR's Jackie Northam is here to talk more about all the latest developments hijacking Louis so start with the U.S stands here over the weekend President Trump was warning Saudi Arabia about severe punishment his words if it were discovered the the kingdom had anything to do with the suspected murder of ... G\nToday the president was using somewhat different words what's the latest\nWell yes you're right today um Trump said that he spoke to king selmont any firmly denied any knowledge about what happened to ... G\nI Trump suggested that it could have been the work of what he called rogue killers and this would make it easier for the king in crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to stick to their denials um this despite the fact that ... was last seen going into the Saudi consulate\nSo that today and it may be too soon to conclude this but these may be the kinds of movies you see when countries are trying to find a way out of this increasingly explosive situation\n[noise] want to ask you about swimming CNN is reporting today they are reporting Saudi Arabia is preparing a to report the show was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing to unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened a door for Saturday to try to ... when we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight here I Am named this very strong relationship between the two countries they cooperate on things like counter terrorism and there was a U.S political element to this as well certainly Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd there's a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America\nSo they may look at things like whatever happened was not ordered by Saudi leaders or perhaps it was an attempt to detain and interrogate because she'll gee that went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis claims that the journalists had left the consulate safely you\nMentioned President Trump today said may be this was the work of rogue killers um I mean so many people are saying this all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia having had a chance here where is that coming from what kind of reaction is getting\nUm well you know is it you know one of the two leaders are talking the Saudis and the U.S you know there's been growing outrage in the U. S. and L. square about this and is still Mary Louise has touched a raw nerve\nAnd it's likely there would be a revulsion if the truth seems to be obscured somehow I spoke with a ... sort of the committee to protect journalists and he said it could stifle any criticism of Saudi leaders in the future\nMaybe that gee if you were alone are programming call right now one eight hundred for for for nine two four six or give on line at WBAI Jim dot O.

Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the euro rate is less than one of 'em\nNow the president wants to call my mom a lawyer\nOne of the facts and a slew of Native American ancestry your bedroom\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations can also here at least who one of members have been to an audience of every or is the president himself a lady responded to although he\nHas and no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of\nDaycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this\nI won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity for trouble if you take the test of the shows you earn it is [laughter]\n\n[noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up ... million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard or the late ... and the war with after him again on Twitter\nSaying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter and my cynical to ask about the timing\nAnything from ... because they're completely dishonest and they're just trying to say and outrage to try to turn out there to support exact match has been a policy of ... office since ... ten\nSeveral civil rights groups challenged in court in twenty sixteen and parts of the policy were suspended but in twenty Seventeen to Republican controlled state legislature made it a law\nSo some of the same groups sued Kemp again last week arguing the law violates the voting rights act Danielle\nLaying with the campaign Legal Center is one of their lawyers\nThis policy doesn't flag the right people and leads to an extraordinarily high error rate where tens of thousands of eligible voters are flagged for potential removal based on you know a hype and here in the space there or transpose DeGette\nBrian Kemp campaign blamed quote sloppy work by a voter registration group called the New Georgia project that democratic candidates Stacey Abrams founded that group is focused on minority and young voters ... office actually investigated the New Georgia project for fraud back in twenty four team investigation was later dropped\nAbrams told W.

days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica ... found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions those violations going to have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states it all but two women get disciplined to higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison walls a rich\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors and get written up or jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just speak to your room up nice in just takes until late in dire appeal the case you get written up for that\nThat's Victoria Williams and it made up the central California women's facility in charge show a California you get\nWritten up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room are out of bounds in the hallway [noise]\nIt's just basically everything you get written up for our number showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying\nAn order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the

G\nI Trump suggested that it could have been the work of what he called rogue killers and it doesn't make it easier for the king in crown prince Mohammed bin ... to stick to their denials um this despite the fact that ... was last seen going into the Saudi consulate\nAnd if you say the president of the dispatch secretary ... talked with Saudi leaders and the search the conflict today and it may be too soon to conclude this but these may be the kinds of movies you see when countries are trying to find a way out of this increasingly explosive situation\nWhen I ask you about swimming CNN is reporting today they are reporting Saudi Arabia is preparing to report the show was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened a door for Saturday to try to ... when we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight here I Am name is ...\nThis is well certainly a Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd there is a multi billion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America so they may look at things like whatever happened was not ordered by Saudi leaders or perhaps it was an attempt to detain and interrogate because she'll gee\nThat went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis claims that the journalists had left the consulate safely\nYou mentioned President Trump today said maybe this\nWas the work of rogue killers um I mean so many people are saying ... all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia having had a chance here where is that coming from what kind of reaction is getting\nUm well you know it's it's you know one of the two leaders are talking the Saudis and the U.S you know there's really growing outrage in the U.S and elsewhere about this and is still Mary Louise has touched a raw nerve\nAnd it's likely there would be a revulsion if the truth seems to be obscured somehow I spoke with a Sharif men sort of the committee to protect journalists and he said it could stifle any criticism of Saudi leaders in the future\nPut your money where your ears are I I thought about color and some friends who I Believe maybe other

[noise]\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this is an attempt to quiet a controversy that has dogged at war and for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly ... what did Elizabeth Warren released today show she\nReleased the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos ... day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry you know in addition to this DNA Analysis or and also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and sending yet from her family history\nShe had this one scene in particular what she calls ... ...\nWe're very highly confident we believe the euro rate is less than one of them now the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts are we going to murder interest or your editor\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here or at least who one of members have been to an audience of every or is the president himself a lady responded to although he has\nAnd no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this\nI won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity for trouble if you take the test so that shows your\nYour [noise]\n[noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up ... million dollar he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard or the late ... and the war and went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned the shoes are going to run for president herself in twenty twenty I think that's a really\nRealistic God's at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about\nPotentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms and she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty race is going to kick off pretty much as soon as the mid term\nBut very briefly has quieted all of those of us it's ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the reports\nStray that still leaves a lot of unanswered questions right that is NPR's political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks very much you know walk\nI this is Steve Inskeep with NPR News [noise]\nThere are lots of places that you can turn the latest on the lips of new from it\nAnd in fact there are more and more outlets that don't really\nGenerate any new information they don't report anything they repackage what is already there which they think is true and might be relevant or might be not but gosh it's new\nWhat public radio does is try to make sense of that often what we're trying to do is slowed down the news cycle rather than speed it up or trying to figure out what happened last week that really matters today and I think we're able to do that in a different way because we are supported by listeners\nMost other news outlets are dependent on advertising and that's fine but in the end you're doing the bidding of the people who pay the bills and it's better if some or most actually of the bills are paid by the people who consume the news\nIt's enlightened self interest in a way when you contribute to public radio you're contributing to yourself you're contributing to your own information you can get it for free but it's actually better to pay for it because you want it to be for you\nAnd so when you're making a contribution you're doing something that I think improves your own life and you're actually able to see the money come back to new in the form of information that is just done a little differently and that you can rely on maybe a little bit more\nYou can get down to your favorite public radio station that Ninety point the w._b.

prepared to leave for a tour of areas hit by hurricane Michael\nYou didn't really know I don't want to get it is but it sounded to me like you just sort of thing if you go to the bottom of it as well as a flat denial\nWith me now to discuss this and the president's visit to Florida is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Hi Mara I'm Mary Louise how real killers this is quite the turn of phrase do we know the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly with the president is offering an alternative\nTheory of the case although he didn't explain how a group of road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and killed someone\nBut his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times today that the Saudi king flatly firmly denied it\nThis is very similar to what he did with ... and when he cited pollutants strong denials of any interference in the twenty sixteen election and back then he also offered an alternative theory of the case where he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on his bed could have been the hacker of the Democratic party emails\nSo clearly the president's instinct is to defend dictators\nSo real killers is maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy yes see okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nThis was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races this cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can't keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural disasters are a very positive political opportunity for incumbent governors because they have the reason\nWell really keeping in the spotlight\nAsk you about one of the big issues in the Florida Senate race this is the red algae bloom the spin following the state's be choose and which is tied to warmer waters that come with climate change and the warmer waters which are of course also tied to the increasing intensity of hurricanes like hurricane Michael how is the president talking about that how's Rick Scott talking about\nThat well what's so interesting about that is the president gave an interview to sixty minutes last night in which he said he thought the climate was changing but he wouldn't say that people are human activity was behind that change even said well the climate is changing it could change back\nAh and then when asked will Ninety nine percent of scientists believe

Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish we're spending a few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the middle school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify\nA smaller infractions petty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room up nice in just takes and too late and die you appeal the case you get written up for that\nThat's big tortilla Williams and it made up of central

Vermont we've found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called\nThose tickets have consequences women moves good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement\nIn Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience [noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those fan\nThe and ... says those rules don't work very well with women\nYou walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet ban of some of the day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison Illinois several years ago ... was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk to a prison there more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children that want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice helped conduct an audit of that women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... Toto says she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nThe first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in to women we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling\nWhile women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental illness those who are lesbian bisexual or transgender African American women especially for those lesser non violent offenses\n... ... a guard out because they said that to me that I light or yeah stuff like that\nAnd our foster care facility in prison after a fight with an inmate Williams was charged with hitting an officer who tried to stop it or sentence was doubled from two years to four but most of her tickets for cursing and talking back to officers and those kept her in prison for extra days and she lost privileges\nOne time she says she got in trouble for cursing at a guard when her soul mate who had diabetes passed out William salt the officer was too slow to help Williams says the hardest thing was when she lost her phone privileges and she couldn't call her son he was a baby when she went to prison and he was growing up without her\nIt was sad because I'm Mr yeah I I missed when he refers to the ... that\nHe's nine now but Titanic Williams says that time separated often not even able to talk to him on the phone makes it hard to be a parent now\nEven today there had to deal with the consequences are miss it out here on this is it hard right next to this day\n'cause I I still don't understand I understand my summer hating ... author and marked down the aisle they have like curvy current you're gone\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children under the age of Eighteen one common punishment that Illinois prison was that women last good conduct credits in one year alone twenty Fifteen women most Ninety three years of those credits that's twenty extra days or prison time for each woman\nThat's an average many women had no days added but some ended up with months even a year or more of extra time [noise]\nA small number of states including Illinois or trying to change this they're praying what's called gender response of corrections practices it's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men\nThat they respond differently in prison and that prison rules need to recognize those differences in the last ...\nFound out she\nHad that prison in Illinois a trainer at the front of a classroom tells corrections officers to think through the different pressures in a woman's life\nAnd she needs to see what's going on with their Spanish she asked me how\nTo deal with this with phone privileges revoked all she can do is write a letter home or to her son's school it's reminder to the corrections officers tickets even once for a lesser offense\nTraining they didn't want to give their names they set the agenda response of approach makes sense to them but that many of their co workers are much more skeptical\nI was ...
