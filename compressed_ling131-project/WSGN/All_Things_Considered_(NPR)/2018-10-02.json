night no\nSo that's the description who gave Fox News several days later he spoke to the Senate Judiciary committee under oath and here's what he said in his opening statement\nI drank beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I too many beers sometimes others did I liked fear still light beer\nBut I did not drink beer to the point of watching out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nAnd that set the stage for many hours of conversation between Kavanaugh on senators about beer\nYes there were probably two dozen references to beer during the hearing and senators asked about

attention he later I had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician of the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and it came with a very honest and emotional letter message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nThat he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example or having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in a in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization he started to something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment\nAnd that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and um [noise] I mean I Can't think of a politician who's disclosed this sort of thing except usually on the you know on the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior but uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistic saying that\nTo help others confirm this in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nIs NPR's Quil Lawrence ... thank you Ari\nNow we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is where it's almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this year that a meeting in salary at Amazon was less than one to nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before more than\nSeven hundred workers in California warehouse and told them they are getting a raise\nThe executive Dave Clark he told me this was one of his best days at work and the Twenty years has been at Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR sponsors I reached clerk at that California warehouse\nWhere we're announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum they ah before any other\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was just under lemon dollar range of over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff ... [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of ... speech in Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside basis spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful ... said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nOne of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's as soon as a matter of what I did the right\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe but I'm a split decision will cause other companies like Walmart affair food into reading their wages his world so it's a good day for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target lands to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco hit fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news I don't see how it could be other than good news\nIt offers an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers one interpretation is look\nIt was going to have to raise wages any way to labor market is tightening uh so it just you know decide to get the good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so that they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number for a really visit here for Congress but\nSenator Sanders says he hopes the ... stamp of approval convinces the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is right Alina Selyukh NPR News\n\nWith all the news

so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things about the state's six to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories or creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past just to sit on my or\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely your innate sun himself and ask the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him the eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and\nOf all the executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's skits frantic word delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to stay looks forward to being able to

him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in

prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories or creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable\nThat executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas
