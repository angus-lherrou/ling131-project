Florida and joins us now he Debbie hello so I realize we are still in the early stages of this storm it's moving inland now from what I understand what can you tell us so far about the damage it caused\nVery serious I'm In particular there at Mexico beach where it came ashore we're seeing images now of entire um\nYou know streets where the homes have literally been washed away you know this storm brought in a storm surge of nine to fourteen feet right around the I came ashore between sort of tend to air force base in Mexico beach\nI'm not far from Panama City beach if people know where that is along the Florida Panhandle\nLast minute you know I think the last check was was that a hundred and forty five miles an hour and then just before it came ashore at escalated to a hundred and fifty five miles per hour because of the warm Gulf waters giving it more power it came in at his blown down trees and power lines hundreds of thousands of people are already without power\nFor cell phone service is spotty for some I'm hearing crust view which as you said it's about a hundred miles away from where the I came in\nUm it's on the north west side of the storm we've had tropical storm conditions here in the hotel is preparing for power outages so far we haven't had those yet but this is really affecting a wide area of the panhandle\nDid a sense of people were prepared in advance of the storm where they taking the threat seriously enough\nYou know evacuations were ordered for hundreds of thousands of people along the coast and as I drove in yesterday it looked like people were taking it seriously the typical busy tourist towns Fort Walton Beach Panama City were empty they were boarded up\nPeople were driving westward toward Alabama to try to get out of it um you know but hurricane Michael came up pretty fast over the weekend and so there wasn't a lot of lead time to prepare for this you pretty much had to get ready and get out once the forecasters sort of gave you that\nCone of of of where the that the hit was likely to come now there has been some controversy in Florida over the last couple of days I'm between local officials and the state's emergency management director was small um\nFirst reported by political Florida a they got a hold of an email that he sent saying that he was being very critical of local officials for not getting shelters reading and asking the state for help early and so we'll see how that plays out over the next few days and we knew that Michael\nIs the most powerful hurricane to hit the panhandle it's actually one of the strongest have ever hit the Gulf Coast right\nRight a category five would be stronger and you have to go all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine hurricane Camille in missed\nAt strong of a

you're not supposed to inject beeping are few and they're on and don't have a prescription someone told it to them illegally which is known as diversion\nSome state national policy makers have pointed to this diversion as a reason to regulate beeping or if you prescribe ... more but many addiction doctors say the problem is misunderstood factor Kelly Clark is president of the American society of addiction medicine she says for one thing ... not as dangerous as other opioids\nWe care about diversion from the public health standpoint because of the risks of overdose and arrested overdose ... are minimal\nYou can overdose from beeping or if you especially if you mix it with other substances but it's rare\nBuprenorphine is less potent than drugs like heroin and ... and can even walk their effects\nThis also means that few people use it to get high instead more people use it to prevent withdrawal and to try to stay away from other illegal drugs that's what their own end it ... is an

stay safe thanks so much\n\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks all their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John Hi also so what parts of the market scientists plummet today\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard ah it's been the foundation of a this um market but ah all of the uh all sectors really were down um\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk game since mid summer\nBut the tech sector has been the hardest hit and and as I said I just wanted the foundations who mark and in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the ... which also has a lot of tech\nLost three and a third percent so it was a tough day ... day for everyone but particularly for\nTech um now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate on the Federal Reserve has said they will continue to raise rates gradually it suggested I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous in fact I this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the ...\nGradually and just as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go there are a some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets to their wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more inflation pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... student ... good for the stock market what happened\nWell the economy is strong in the U.S and most comedies are saying today cell of his not the end of a double marketing stocks\nSo a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe is cool to bed and so I have emerging markets or the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are these concerns about a global trade war a disrupting a the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China\nSo what we saw today is this could this be the beginning ... long downward trend\nWell most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading uh driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nGiven the strength to the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit is it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nBut there are are are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months\nOr two a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's NPR's John Ydstie thanks time You're welcome [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into his gentle last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed to Cairo and by\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saturday consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saturdays sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was I don't think\nWell in a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture show not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit this is U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing this Yogi\nCorrect is is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumbled could be sort of a plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in\nAfter he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate but it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to\nDo that do we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think\nThere's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling\nYou say they trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced the he sort of ousted and I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia [noise] when\nYou talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely Jerry ... have been some honor NBS says she sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there's a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\n... ... ...

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nA bill headed to President Trump's desk could make it easier for people to get a drug to treat opioid addiction under current law healthcare providers can prescribe only so much of it the bill would ease some of those restrictions\nFor now many people have turned to the black market to get the medicine and treat their addiction on their own\nJake Harper of side effects public media reports from Indiana and Darryl are about to\nDo something illegal at the back side of that white NPR's using their middle name had to the back of a building in Austin and in some train\nCars aren't going to drive the price comes acted out there they could drive down here and we're just going right here\nThey settled with Darrell how they use in a while and he's sick from a drawl [noise]\nSo he perhaps two syringes than he picked one of them six the needle on his arm and pushes down the ... what does it feel like a hundred percent veterans you if you watched closely he doesn't\nPut heroin in the syringes their own and injected drug meant to ...\nBe better known under the brand name Suboxone and for people who use heroin or other opioids it reduces cravings and prevent withdrawal there'll says the first time he injected it his nacho diarrhea disappeared\nDid you feel high or did you feel normal I feel at first I felt like I was huh but\nI think if we're not felt normal in so long I think that's what normal cells not now\nBut you're not supposed to inject buprenorphine and they're on and don't have a prescription someone told it to them illegally which is known as diversion\nSome state national policy makers have pointed to this diversion as a reason to regulate beeping or if you prescribe ... more but many addiction doctors say the problem is misunderstood factor Kelly Clark is president of the American society of addiction medicine she says for one thing the parking is not as dangerous as other opioids\nWe care about diversion from the public health standpoint because of the risks of overdose and arrested overdose with Ethan working are minimal\nYou can overdose from buprenorphine especially if you mix it with other substances but it's rare\nBuprenorphine is less potent than drugs like heroin and ... and can even walk their effects\nThis also means that few people use it to get high instead more people use it to prevent withdrawals and to try to stay away from other illegal drugs that's what their own end it Dr Michelle ... is an addiction specialist in Kentucky she says people off and try to treat themselves when they struggle to get into real treatment\nThese people want help and they tried and they didn't succeed and so now they're going to go get it when it's available\nIt can be easier to get ... on the street prescribe ers can be hard to find in federal rules to limit the number of people that can treat patients need insurance for another way to pay for treatment ... says the street treatment is not ideal but it can lead people to a big realization\nI've seen that happen let people coming in wanting treatment specifically because they've had it and they know it works for them and they want to get it legally and they want to get their life back\nThat happen to Daryl the day I met him he came into a clinic to sign up for insurance so he could get professional help\nAnything trying it on the street the way that you have has led you to this\nYeah I think so I think if I had never started amongst great I wouldn't be sitting here right now talking you ... ... and doing nothing will get huh\nYou still haven't made it into treatment he had trouble starting his insurance and when he couldn't find bin ... he went back to heroin addiction can take years to conquer but Darrell says his time on ... let him see a way back to a normal life for\nNPR News I'm Jake Harper and that story's part\nMake sacrifices to go above and beyond the call of duty that's what NPR's John Burnett did when he recorded from the Texas state fair\nTo twenty five year old son willy and I told them I was going to do a story and fried foods in Texas and\nSo we were just sitting around speaking what could we do that would really I'm surprised listeners and then I said I'm going to fry my microphone because then Texas they'll deep fry\nAnything they deep fried beer they deep fry bubblegum they deep fried Coca Cola they deep fry a peanut butter and jelly sandwiches it's outrageous\nOne at a microphone I didn't try just any microphone I fried an old a six thirty\nFive electric voice which I was assigned when I joined NPR in Nineteen eighty six you know I turned it on and then I said and this is the sound of a southern fried microphone and we dropped in the oil and it kept recording [noise]\nAll NPR reporters are thinking of\nNew sounds and where can be taken my friend that has been taken I went slower to microphone into a rattlesnake\nHit and had a rattlesnakes actually hit the microphone with their fangs which was pretty cool so you know be we put them inside hide so it's it's this unspoken competition that NPR reporters have where can we take our microphone where a Mike has never been taken before\nJohn Burnett might actually be the first NPR reporter to deep fry a microphone and we know why he did it to go farther to record the on record label\nAnd aside from the obvious him practicality of deep fry audio equipment you got to know one thing John Burnett sacrifice thirty year old audio equipment for you because you are possibly the only audience would appreciate it the

safe thanks so much [noise]\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks on their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey Jon Kyl so so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous and in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stopped rising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair or a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock\nMarket economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today's sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has cooled a bit as\nHave emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S in China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by the sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the market sold off today or wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market\nIn fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today and that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tax laws\nIt's just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the doubt down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down was due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued\nHigh levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down but we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession\nWe're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks will see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens will say that is NPR's John Ydstie Thanks John You're welcome\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn Wyoming state

flooding streets toppling trees and power lines\n... long is the administrator of Leon county that is home to Tallahassee and we reached him at his desk at the county's emergency operations

to um get a bit of a status of\nThings I fit the nature of the calls now I have turned mostly to power outages and that sort of thing\nWhich I guess in the grand scheme of things would be good news if people are worried about power outages it's it's so far you're not getting calls from people who need to be rescued from dar situations\nSuch cleric or however we expect significant damage from downed trees that constitutes a threat no community known for its cannot be roads large ponds and big oak trees we have not responded\nTo that risk a yet however I should note that our emergency crews in our

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and to buy\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post to which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudis sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that it is Fifteen people is a lot to to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually there's a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you're not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing because Yogi\nIs as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis\nStand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe\nAt the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith there at the consulate but it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ... what\nMy sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source wants you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think\nThere's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House in the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman absolutely\nJerry ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into ...\nStretch of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon\nPenny Nance a CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed in a very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases to move forward to sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn says in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this court\nEfforts will now be supersized again says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest we know that we're going to need an ironclad network\nHappens on the Supreme Court in the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the midterm elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are among those\nNamed Raul is also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B.
