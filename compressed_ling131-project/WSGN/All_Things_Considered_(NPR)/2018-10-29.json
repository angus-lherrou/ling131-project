public radio for the heart of Alabama Ninety point three WB H. and burning him and one in four point five asked him in Fort Paine\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage and the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back events happening\nYou've or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nShe says oh God I Can't do it she doesn't have any of these laws I Am all she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum call and you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that well\nYou mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thinks Asia

how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack are on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his\nOpponents are and and against the media uh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the ... solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief\nUh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nI just do what she does or not it is what she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him a beef with out\nYou is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric mc\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any boats or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his

defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general ... who's in charge of northern command\nReno border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom ... says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nJust goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty switches transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional five\nThousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role get no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still we still do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more ... uh barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more\nAn additional border agents so these soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week oh there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they make clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only in a support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others uh we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq and right and maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you You're welcome\nTheir quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen Florida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he is betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike\nAnd we're bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal with Trump to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration and side of the solutions for immigration\nThat took her belly we spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change in trade but he also largely voted to back the president's agenda when it comes to health care and taxes now he's running for reelection and a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen\nPoints and he's running on a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party don't remote remember ever apologizing for anything\nI've said whatever I've said as what I Believe so why would I watch it by that same approach helped him winning twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria ... Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nImages and true so he tells the plot that he's a moderate but when you see his voting record that is completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do not do that extra step and they just hear him and they say wow you know he sounds good this year his opponent Democrat Demi Moore car so Powell is trying to change\nThat you know they need information we need to provide information and\nAccess and make voting in the car so Powell is an energetic far educator\nMom and an immigrant from Ecuador she's running on protecting immigrants health care and the environment all things that occur Bello says he also wants to protect their locked in a battle to convince voters who's telling\nThe truth I should be ahead by fixing points if it's a straight democratic district but it's not it's complicated\nConvincing voters who's right is a unique challenge in a diverse district that stretches from the suburbs of Miami south through farm fields and onto the tourist hub of Key West about Seventy percent of the population is Hispanic roughly half of Cuban descent\nCurb below the son of Cuban exile

mean when it comes to listen and tries to do something about the problem that affects state whose area you know that's all you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises but McCarthy Powell also worries that the people are party needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism me not show up at fault\nIf we get our people to come out and vote I when it's going to be a close race for me my focus my campaign's focus is making sure they know who I Am

asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\nAnd [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nBy most accounts Federal Reserve policymakers have been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heat it up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips curve if you put it in a murder mystery\nFramework or who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard the president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nBullard says the Philips curve isn't working\nBut rumors of its death maybe exaggerated\nIt certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell\nOh so he for pale to fill up the car\nI wouldn't say it's dead it might be ...\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage\nTo complain about this subject so often to do this for the phone from the city was thrilled with this was\nWhen I was looking at what\nIs not that interested in\nThe Philippines curve could just be arresting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and on\nThe traditional way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhether the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response owing thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that will confirm your belief about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say give me Rowan
