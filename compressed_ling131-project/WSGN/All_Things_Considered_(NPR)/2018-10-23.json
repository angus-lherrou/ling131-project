is this face off\nCrazy also these teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched game show that game for the Boston Red Sox who ... even without favor you might've heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees that's how far back\n... they go okay well yeah and they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic matchup it's something that in the modern\nEach other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them she's two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case of daughter's got it torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games that I went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they went and got many Machado I mean this is Ben they're often said well either he's at shortstop they lost Corey secret during the season so now they have a child and then really is there a case I Know it's not Clinton ...\nIts Walker dealer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best picture that we've seen in the national ... they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this they want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even\nThough the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had\nDefinitely Boston is that a lot of reasons to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this gene is arguably one of the best regular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all\nNo one cares about hey you want a hundred and eight games yeah you get an award you get a crowd and you don't get anything\nOh you get as you want a hundred and eight games yeah they were in the ... they are so good outside but as we know and the post season the best scenes and always when you got to go out and play All right I Want\nYour crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win\nDaughters and that's going to shock a lot of people because the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper\nThere is nobody better but what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care throw the numbers out\nYet is redemption it's passion it's it's this prior to the Dodgers have because they lost in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year\nThat was

things considered I Know said Chang and I'm Audie Cornish President Trump is campaigning hard with just two weeks to go until the mid term elections and he's keeping the fact checkers busy\nWe're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott highly first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way through Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan he was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim\nBut he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country that bomb not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nAh there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald\nAnd polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\nThe\nCommon sense [noise]\nI just started on that list which was a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we haven't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe ... is not warn terribly well right now is pulling it about forty percent approval or a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night Audi but I have to one you take this message with a big grain of salt\nWhere are you going to be put in a ... percent tax cuts\nFor middle income families is going to be\nOr whatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election\nAnd what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming weeks\nBut this appears to be a bit of political vapor where that's just time for the election and a tacit admission to the actual tax cut the Republicans passed last year isn't selling very

laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory\nWas efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified purging has a\nPractice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nWhat we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a\nAdministrative effort [noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe\nMany of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet\nI I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you there are few subjects that can divide

[noise]\nFrom NPR News this is all\nSo 'til the mid term elections and he's keeping the fact checkers busy\nWe're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott I already first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan he was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim\nBut he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty four for ... war from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nOr there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n\n[noise]\nCensored on that list which was a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe ... is not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank the president believes he has a fix for this though\nI have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nWe're going to be a tax cuts\nFor middle income families is going to be\nOr whatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to be take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election\nAnd what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming weeks\nBut this appears to be a bit of political vapor aware that it's just time for the election and a tacit admission to the actual tax cut the Republicans passed last year isn't selling very\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from capital one offering a variety of credit card options with features for a range of

all things considered ... and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs North Dakota law requiring voter IDs to include street addresses has also gotten attention\nManner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of an why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but what we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenge\nOf of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified purging has a practice\nOf removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of that is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people perched uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late\nUm critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would\nPush back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed her very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way a that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed\nIt's an elections project thank you for speaking with all things
