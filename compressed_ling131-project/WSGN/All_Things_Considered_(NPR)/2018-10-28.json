I Know that this is ... ... and many others are just really shouldn't have done because you want to ... I I don't know what to do\nIt and I heard you read into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I talked to Lisa flesh or Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in a synagogue this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified what what happened and I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but at the attack on\nOn everybody in a community and recover strong and some are going to make it through\nAnd uh as I said she was with her niece who's sixteen alley they both so you know this has many generations with his family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\nWell I went to\nA tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that were\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have gun laws so we definitely don't need to have you know security guards at our schools at our temples at our church is\nThe shouldn't have to I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers ought to this but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nWelfare you also but getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much\nYeah thanks tucked in and ... other Pittsburgh\nUnited Methodist church across town\nOpen their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special surface to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers\nUm but as I mentioned in my my sermons also find our voice\nYou know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way cannot be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I guess yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid that puts a target on her back on\nThe open and affirming you mean that everything every once in a while because everyone is welcome to write and everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship but they did come and to say thank you for doing this you know it makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter Caribbean for roses in honor of\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events or because he was a police officer in white hall nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening for us personally um but I I Try to allow God spirit to give me the boldness that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred\nMultiple for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday as a tax on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was ... was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home well\nThis church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that and of course it's the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time\nAnd how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head tenants plans that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know but you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plan anyone wants to have but it's become a reality\nThat you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking of how\nWe also met a father and son oldest and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and ... said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nIn African American beer blog or were you know how these things are yours you're all through or a certain group of people look at your front of\nA storm water field are you should be there because a year or so your caller\nMassey what about you I'm going to get the sense that this resonated with you even though it wasn't this particular attack was directed at\nYou and I just can you just described why that is\nBecause I remember I was looking at the news was yesterday a photo reminder says I'm gay and Orlando resident me I'm also walk in the south Carolina she moved me because it was people who are religious\nAnd ... American right to worship how we want to worship when we want to worship in peace and for someone to come in and just\nMurders I'm for for ... for loving the same God that they love is is it's just unbelievable to me\nDid it help being here today to helping a judge today\nWe're altogether morning and it really allowed me to lift up my English and say you know just put it in God's hands\nAnd it gave me hope because as pastor Russell was speaking the sunshine started to shine and it's been cloudy all day in its burn the sun was shining and I felt like I was telling me that you know\n[noise]\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines security has been stepped up at synagogues around the country after eleven people died at a Pittsburgh synagogue yesterday the names of the victims were released today including a married couple and two brothers\nMeanwhile President Trump ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half staff in honor of those who died in the mass shooting he also condemned what he called an evil anti Semitic act\nThe leaders of Russia Germany France and turkey are calling for a complete cease fire in Syria\nAs well as the creation of a committee to draft a new constitution by the end of the year the leaders met in Istanbul this weekend discussing the conflict in Syria that's killed an estimated four hundred thousand people over the past seven years I'm Janine hurts to NPR News in Washington [noise]\nDo\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Elijah Craig family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey he lies you Craig Potts town Kentucky forty seven percent alcohol by volume ... promotes responsible drinking\nFrom Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring Diane Lane Noah Wiley Christina Hendricks and Andrew rentals a new episode every Friday on prime video and from the sustaining members of this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we are here at W. E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleven people who were shot to death at a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond\nHave gathered in a packed auditorium NPR's Quil Lawrence has outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day Quil welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this\nFire Gettysburg Address um I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\nSome lovely now you also spent some time in squirrel held the neighborhood where this attack occurred what was the mood there\n[noise] yeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the community it's notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the sixth president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI came today they're\nWaiting patient and now says hey I think I'm going to let them read the articles and these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just giving them the space I have\nProcess that happened and what they thought they were really moved by family members of the Holocaust or weak\nAnd people were saying that you know in the little town like this you never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who is affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I rented to Dan Franklin he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal he's what he said\nAnd they were really specials with men who are known for many years and whenever I go to a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding and or some kind of occasions\nYou talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nI felt like people were in this or this sort of cycle of sorrow and the fraud and the solidarity that community showing\nAnd then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they say they talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence called thank you thank you and as you\nJust heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's\nMinds and fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue he also wants to other places tell us about that\nYou actually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and uh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so\nIt was very new to us\nFor me across the room at least\nThe Hoffman was also ensure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand [noise] um [noise]\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I have\nHow we well Hofmann grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has\nTies to send a lot of my\nFriends had by environment that tree of life I had\nAttendant Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went though is just really [noise]\nPricing upsetting disappointing that that people get these stunts and their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nNot that they can't but they actually\nDevin deal runs the make shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work hard to um know that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feeling [noise]\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as\nAnd I'm being\nWith the community right now feels are important and powerful for me to still says today's plant originally\nFocused on Halloween but after the shooting she switched things up and encourage the kids to build models have houses and buildings and other familiar places they care about places that may Pittsburgh home Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\nSorry thank you for that and finally today I reached out to an old friend to give us one more perspective on yesterday's shooting David trip and we used to work together in Washington DC now he is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nHe lives just three blocks from the tree of life synagogue and he's published too powerful pieces one for his own paper and another for the New York times and he's with us now from his office at the post because I think the treatment and it's good
