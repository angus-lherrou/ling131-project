this piece I mean how did you realize that the the church was torn about what was going on with Brett Kavanaugh\nWell actually some people from the church had reached out to me to say we're really struggling with us\nTo talk to me a little bit about what some of those issues were that it's bringing up what were some of the conversations that people had been having about this before\nThe allegations on Dr Ford's allegations came up people were saying they had already we're already kind of struggling it how do they\nKeep in this kind of spiritual community or you know keeping a community when they were already had political issues with some of the things that were coming out about um judge Kavanaugh whether it you know maybe things they hadn't paid attention to before you know some of his writings\nThen it kind of laid another series of things including people who thought well this seems like it's connected to this other massive sexual abuse\nTopic that we're wrestling with together as a faith and people who thought those were completely unconnected the Catholic clergy sex abuse scandal and the idea of these women bringing forward allegations that it'll be interesting to see how they are going forward now that he's been confirmed\nHow do people see church there\nAnd I think it's less than sacrament is typical of a lot of Catholic churches in that it doesn't make\nPolitical positions kind of central I mean you'd there there is a sacrament like smaller groups where you have people who are a little bit more like minded who might be completely focused on\nDealing with immigration or the Muslim ban or algae Beatty rights but when they all get together I think people who go to buses sacrament off and kind of\nI don't know if the right word is brag but they love the fact that they have different types of people have different political persuasion you know it's an escape for a lot of people a break from you know the intense politicking but right now it's landed right in the middle of their ...\nYou mentioned in your piece that the priest there hasn't been addressing the elephant in the room directly and I wonder how is that going

everything we've survived here Lauren Frayer NPR News ... Indonesia\nThe state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats and employees of us based international organizations unless the partners are legally\nIt's consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote but critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could face persecution back home but if they do not marry some partners could face deportation James Wiley Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had first hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate that\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as\nA spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is our main objective was to make sure that he had the fool\nImmunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that you can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the papal noon CEO who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president in the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of a policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for dependent these is now the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that compares to different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have or to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from the administration and the ...\nOriginal fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U.S throughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have a number of filled situation\nYou know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who was a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through\nSomehow in figure out how to get married in another country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Brewster he wasn't passed through to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global ambassador thank you so much for talking to us\nWell it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you to have the best days\nNow to our series on China's growing influence in the world

police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nNo violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year\nFor felt she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about four to some think of who says versus said there's something of says\nSo from my perspective it's really what drives they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what that I often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turn that we are saying that is dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if you look at the most pressing yes we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation\nAnd we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas the handling and all persons with mental illness so it's not the topic violations ... and ... no longer than\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nThe people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police are though to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years because of the on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity to violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have the the cut us off the outcome\nSo somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the\nThe demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... of the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take your anger out to get on the given politics and instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative for the government with the police so\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with this\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that uh that part of the ... that activity is definitely a training in your office so frequently\nA sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment given the fed and political development that might be putting their life and then some this tactical issue is how you approach and the problem and how you go to the house a well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous\nI mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have a thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would certainly help us make gay the negative perception of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable that nine officers in one year aren't killed in that line of duty of an outcome of premeditated activity that was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should\nAccept a nine police officers in one year in separate incidents killed by members ... can accept\nThat as Maria have are felt she is a professor in the department of law police science at criminal justice administration at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York professor ...
