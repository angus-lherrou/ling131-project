knew nothing about the operation acclaimed viewed with skepticism outside the kingdom\nNow to understand the aims of the Turkish government we're joined by Amanda slow she's a senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings she just got back from his stumble welcome to the program\nThank you so as a point of contacts there has been a rift between these two countries right that predates this murder\nYeah absolutely some of the tension goes back to the Arab Spring of twenty ten when Turkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these

on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nA little one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not a Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis\nBut I think this weekend when there was a
