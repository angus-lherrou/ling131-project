times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct any well training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places on the rules apply to all employers regardless of size all this comes as new\nPeter shelf co owner of ... deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it until you can call and tell he has six employees and says sexual harassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says we never really had a policy or even written down\nNow that it's on his radar he says he'll comply you know one more bureaucratic hurdles that we're not used to certainly for the cause of course Frank Kenya as a Rochester based human resources consultant\nWho's clients are small businesses he says even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with a good point\nKenya estimates over half of the state small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including ... during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd then requires feedback from the employees about the training\nAnd the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York city you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one guy\nScience understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd you won't have trading that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protected category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but ... he says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer is not doing this an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about\nUnder the new laws existing employees in New York state must undergo training by October of next year ...
