six\nAnd they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence locking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that fence thousands of people started walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico hit close to a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots or that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nIs that the way okay I'm up for it what is it okay but among [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out he had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was a it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still right here or near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really just\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cop now he's probably four years old has a has a cold\nRag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the class with Mexican\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what their requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to leave us friends who are going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico has\nUh so it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going\nOn in the seconds we have left dreams I mentioned the President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are very aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they're aware of it a Trump does not want to let them into their country and for what they say over and over again as we know that it's there but we're asking we're pleading for help because you know whatever Trump puts in front of us what in fact at home is worse than whatever trend

is campaigning in Arizona tonight the trip is part of a western swing to rally Republican voters head of the mid term elections which are now just over two weeks away last night in Montana he distilled the Republican closing argument heading into the midterm elections to this [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of job and all\nThe power of the law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now a big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in April a this is a new one\nUm and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news ah and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind that care about\nWhat they want a jar of it and there are those who say the caravan didn't just up and it didn't just happen a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to thank the Mexican government because they're stopping it hopefully before it ever [noise]\nShould underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue there are two new\nAmong those who plan to vote Republican and the upcoming elections asked about twenty different issues facing the country\nAnd those supporting Republicans intimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters or she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nI think what this election supposed to be about the Republicans tax cuts which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now yeah and immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border crossings are apparently up\nIt's our extra incentive to encourage you to contribute hubs is the final day of WBAI gyms fall fund drive

H M contribute at whatever level is right for you is that ten dollars for a year is it ten dollars for a month\nIs it ten dollars a day contributed whatever level is right for you whatever amount feels right for your wallet and the listening value that you get each and every day but the important thing is to make that contribution right\nNow one eight hundred for for for nine two four six that's one eight hundred for for for nine two four six I Will leave you with this one thought radio worth listening to his radio worth supporting\nRadio worth listening to his radio worth supporting we're asking for your support right now one eight hundred for for for nine two four six that's one eight hundred for for for nine two four six\nTo thank Linda write a new member listing here in Birmingham ah and ah she likes wait wait\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work could show she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate\nGetting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the church to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think\nIs a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with\nAre simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\nSo you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution\nThat was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included states like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this
