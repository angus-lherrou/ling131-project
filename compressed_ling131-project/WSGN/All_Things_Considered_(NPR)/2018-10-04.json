final vote on Saturday\nAll today senators have been taking turns viewing one copy of the FBI report its latest investigation into Kavanaugh following allegations of sexual assault against the nominee Democrats have criticized the investigation as incomplete an rushed Republicans including Susan Collins and Jeff Flake who could decide Kavanaugh's fate\nHave described it as thorough we're joined now by Senator Patty Murray Democrat of Washington who has said she'll vote no on Kavanaugh welcome back to all things considered\nWell nice to talk today I understand you've seen the report can you give us your reaction [noise]\nWell I was really frustrated and disappointed by the report that we were given a clearly the FBI was told to very narrow the scope of people that they talk to I Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of\nPeople that both I'm a doctor forward and Mr ... gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed you say\nYou should be up there was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI's that they are when they're told debate and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of getting a Gallup allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them well\nI mean that's part of it and ... what we do know about um situations like this where someone has a victim of sexual assault\nThat they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it has absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that\nHow traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later or where she told a therapist or her husband and he talked about it I have had so many women tell me their stories in the airport in a grocery store over the last week or so\nThat that's exactly what happened to them and I think those have to be credible and understood that\nSomeone who was in the house at\nThe time I Know there's been a lot of frustration on both sides of the aisle about how this has been handled elsewhere in the program we spoke with Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota and here's part of what he said\nThe Senate is supposed to be advise and consent and then this particular case are strong feeling up here the Republicans are the Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission\nFrom day one so there's a Republican accusing Democrats of a search and destroy mission against judge Kavanaugh how to respond\nWell first of all let's remember that we are doing a job interview for someone who's going to be on the Supreme Court for a very long time

governments today in accusing a group of Russian military intelligence officers of more cyber mischief the indictment from the U.S Justice Department describes hacks against sports stars and against anti doping agencies in the U.S and in Canada\nIt also says Russians targeted a Dutch group studying the poison used to try and kill a former Russian spy\nAnd beer national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was asked\nThe Justice Department today she is most days and she is back here in the studio now with details who carries Hi Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged unwind now what's the timing yeah the defendants are sat in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering\nA few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's this is very ... yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all of these seven Russian officers are\nIn Russia a and there is no us extradition treaty in place so why bother charging them\nWell FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen that the OJ says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes\nIn general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched this cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes\nWere invading drug tests embarrassed by that truce Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself now\nMary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and another ... announced their own accusations against Russians is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter and the u._k. this year\nSo the Sergei Skripal ... exactly okay\n... I mean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning that the ... I actually had a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in this\nCase NPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes of just a handful of senators they are weighing that decision after getting looked at it\nJoe Manchin of West Virginia He's a red state Democrats who has touted his working relationship with the president and he's fighting to keep his seat in a state that Trump won overwhelmingly NPR's Sarah McCammon has been talking with voters in Charleston West Virginia\nAcross the street from Senator Joe Manchin Charleston campaign office several dozen activists gathered in a park last night standing in a circle and lighting candles [noise]\n\n\nThey help signs with slogans like just say no Joe and cabbage no that's no petey some more light\nGreen armband assigned they've survived sexual assault local activists carry Joe grace was arrested this week during a sit in at mansions office here she says she's tired a lot of it is I'm exhausted because I sat in that office over there and so almost two o'clock in the morning and [noise]\nKind of an American to get off\nThe fence about judge Kavanaugh across town at the county Republican headquarters volunteer Nancy ... sees have an in a totally different light\nI like him I think he's an honest\nIndividual and I think he has suffered his family has suffered [noise] I don't doubt that perhaps some time in this woman's life something has happened to her but I don't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was involved in\n... spent her late afternoon stuffing envelopes for mansions Republican opponent West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey mansion is a longtime figure in West Virginia politics who's sided with President Trump on several key votes including his first Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch\n... says she wants to elect a Republican who will back Trump more reliably than mentioned she's wondering where he'll land on ...\nI think well I think he'll do what Chuck Schumer tells him to do\nThe confirmation fight may be firing up each party's people grassroots activists but in downtown Charleston as workers stepped out for lunches and smoke breaks other issues with all of mine\nAt a diner any queen says he's skeptical of the allegations against Kavanaugh and he's more worried about issues like the opioid epidemic and jobs queen describes himself as a Democrat but supports Trump\nYou see the barges going down the river was cold cold usually dreams road with cold this they live\nAt a nearby farmers market Jennifer ... says she's supporting mansion because she aligns with him on other issues and she wouldn't want to be in mansions shoes right now\nThe situation I Would not want to ban\nMentioned supported calls for an FBI investigation into the cabinet allegations and said he would announce his decision after seeing those results [noise]\nHe's no doubt also seeing the results of polls one this week from great television favored mentioned by several points\nMore popular than Morrissey or a mansion here in West Virginia Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump Sarah McCammon NPR News Charleston [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News\nMORNING EDITION goes to the source to the people affected by the news this plant could shut down and a lot of their people could lose their job is completely ridiculous that we should feel unsafe to go to school and I live\nWhere do they do or that that was\nI knew will get for stories that matter to you listen every weekday to MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nListen tomorrow morning from five to nine right here on your NPR station Ninety point three W.

expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited

Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this ... hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator ... dynamism is probably the quicker ... rate that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so shows you that people are confident letting go their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint the macro economy it's a great sign what a lotta people are quitting because it's suggested they know that they have better options ... where they're leaving for a better job ... they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is they're\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case and the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who wants ... we'll just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but ... does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nYou know it's it's consistent geographically across the u._s. and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the cases that there are more people than ...\nOh said that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish\nIn the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's of course the coast of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they fought pleasure Ari thanks ...\nAnd ... and\nSupport for Planet Money comes from transfer wise a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer a wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries more at transfer wise dot com or from their own\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nFor\nUm\nThe evening and things are joining us on your NPR station Ninety point three WB H him\nPresident Trump says the debate\nOver sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh has put due process on trial in this case you're guilty\nUntil proven innocent I think that is a very very dangerous standard\nFor our country meanwhile Trump often assigned skill to people who haven't been tried that stories just ahead in the next hour of all things considered stay with us You're\nListening to your NPR station Ninety point three WB a gym\n\n\nI'm Mary Scott Hodge and W.

Kavanaugh defender\nWithout learn nothing I didn't already know and I'm Glad the FBI did what they did and their report\nIs completed a key procedural vote is expected to take place tomorrow and that

Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake Tim Mak NPR News Washington\nAs Republican lawmakers are saying the FBI report shows no evidence of sexual misconduct or excessive drinking on the part\nAnd when our friend from Gail who apparently was not interviewed by the FBI and its latest probe and spoke with NPR's all things considered today\nThe basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black man freeze means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nRetired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has come out against the cabinet nominations today speaking event in Florida Steven citing what he said his cabinet as potential

closed up too hot or down rather two hundred points to the NASDAQ was down a hundred and forty five this is NPR\nUs nuclear energy company Westinghouse says it was not compromise by Russian hackers as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports the Justice Department says it was one of a number of targets attacked by agents from Russian military\nMakes nuclear reactors and fuel for those reactors it's recently been supplying that fuel to Ukraine and that appears to be why Russian hackers targeted the company\nAccording to a federal indictment released earlier today back in twenty fourteen in twenty Fifteen the hackers use spoof to emails and fake Web sites to try and steal logging details from Westinghouse employees\nSeveral employees clicked malicious links but a spokesperson says the company security was never breached the indictment also claims hackers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople that they talk to I Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of people that both I'm Dr Ford and Mr Mir as gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed you say\nYou should be up there was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI is that they are when they're told that the and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given um that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of get a gal allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them well\nI mean that's part of it and um and what we do know about um situations like this where someone is a victim of sexual assault\nThat they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it is absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that\nHow traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later\nOr where she told a therapist or her husband and he talked about it I have had so many women tell me their stories in the airport and the grocery store over the last week or so\nThat that's exactly what happened to them and I think those have to be credible and understood that and if you want to get a correct response and understand the full story you can't just ask someone who is in the house at\nThe time I Know there's been a lot of frustration on both sides of the aisle about how this has been handled elsewhere in the program we spoke with Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota and here's part of what he said\nThe Senate is supposed to be advise and consent and then this particular case for a strong feeling up here the Republicans are the Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission\nFrom day one so there's a Republican accusing Democrats of a search and destroy mission against judge Kavanaugh how do you respond\nWell first of all let's remember that we are doing a job interview for someone who's going to

considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nThe U.S joined the European governments today in accusing a group of Russian military intelligence officers of more cyber mischief the indictment from the U.S Justice Department describes hacks against sports stars and against anti doping agencies in the U.S and in Canada\nIt also says Russians targeted a Dutch group that was studying the poison used to try and kill a former Russian spy\nAnd beer national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was at\nThe Justice Department today she is most days and she is back here in the studio now with details who carries Hi Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged unwind now what's the timing yeah the defendants are set in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering\nA few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt paper say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's this is very ... yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all of these seven Russian officers are\nIn Russia a and there is no us extradition treaty in place so who why bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen\nThat the OJ says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government imposed sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes were of eating drug\nTest embarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russians is that coincidence or coordinated very much coordinated the Justice Department actually\nHave the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife find networks there but\nThe Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year ... exactly okay ... I mean\nHere's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nThe D. O. J. wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which begs the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually in a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in this case\nNPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes who just a handful of

the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nAny field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah ... I've demonstrated here actually is real\nLee a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nAre amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much

theory to Canada under the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement could help us farmers do marginally\nLast year in Wisconsin dozens of farmers were left without a milk buyer when a regional company suddenly lost sales to Canada\nThat's because candidates dairy industry implemented a new pricing policy it called class seven\nThe goal was to boost domestic sales and that hurt competition from us imports well do sales only represented about one percent of Wisconsin's animal milk production the shock of seeing farmers lose their buyers overnight sparked national efforts to oppose candidates move\nBy the time the Trump Administration open NAFTA negotiations fixing the dairy market was a top priority and it wasn't until Canada agreed to end the controversial policy the new trade agreement was reached\nMark Stevens said had dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin Madison he says the fight wasn't really about trade between the two countries it was about other markets to\nJanitor

starting to question whether the new trade agreement will really be all that helpful Wisconsin dairy farmer mark Heinz lost his milk by her last year because of candidates new but he says fixing trade with Canada will really help make his financial situation better\nThere's some pretty major problems in the dairy industry and an agriculture in general right now so this is a certainly a band aid and not a fix\nHindsight's issues like the nonstop growth of us milk production and the disconnect between what farmers received for their milk and prices at the grocery store\nWith the Trump
