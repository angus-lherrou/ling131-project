B. H 'em down or\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the United States Supreme court\nThis afternoon the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on a vote a fifty two forty eight one of the closest margins ever minutes later the White House announced that he would be sworn in during a private ceremony later today\nNPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill it's got welcome thanks for joining us famous show so first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides\nSo as that was happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests stir mansion\n[noise]\nCircles has been [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery so that's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene in the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis this has all been so partisan\nAnd divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are in ...\nWhy says this is another case of a woman being ignored that's what I Am\nLeft with Mr President anger Harry discuss and a process that could not see the truth of what Dr for I've tried to tell us\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed\nMore than I can say those who of unleashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy or more sport they have put them through\nWell let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about that\nThey did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believed that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr that they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday ensuring Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed to the court that there were no corroborating accounts more questions than not\nSuddenly and we have the same result as Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill testified about Clarence Thomas a woman comes forward with allegations and the man she accused ends up on the Supreme Court\nBut let's talk about sort of more broadly for the minute or so that we have left if you were anywhere near the capital if you were watching or listening you could hear those rock as a protest mainly for people opposing cabinet but we also saw some people\nDo\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from log me in maker of go to meeting proud sponsor of the how I built this summit

I'm Michelle Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kevin assaulted her years ago\nWhen I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had\nThe full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter\nOr have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now um respects you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her just shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and ... and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she did want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\n[noise] I think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given\nA voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to\nBe an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before\nThe final confirmation vote Mm\nThere's a three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting in November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour it's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe decided to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old I work at ... Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually\nSo I've been at this film at center since it opened up about six years ago and\nI Am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen\nAnd I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now\nThe way the two years for my stocks to vast\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer ... center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five\nAn hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five an hour all it's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus\nAnd when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nMoney ... Martinez had been working on this on for the last three weeks I worked in the ... century Miami I started working in a store is a process and the company that you received a merchandise\nAnd Maine to bring the inventory on his farm raising them and others for hours and now with the trees were going to be freezing dollars an hour after November first\nHow you feel very excited about it very hard to decode other provider I didn't know it can be used to my farm in a better quality and also I think there's been more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for ... full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who\nTell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wait\nTheir existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour in addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour most of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you can hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you\nWere before so I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase in the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nIdea why why why did they announce it so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company um Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number\nThe median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for a family of four now that is a worldwide none\nIs run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been putting quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nOkay before we wrap up here part of the Amazon announcement also mentioned that the company plans to lobby for a higher federal minimum wage and I'm asking you to speculate but do you think this was going to have an impact beyond Amazon itself\nI think that was one of the most important parts of their announcement it does very rare for a corporation especially for Amazon to take kind of a very political stance and in this particular case I mean we're talking about federal minimum wage right now is seven dollars and twenty five cents it is an extremely low\nI'm Janine hurts

Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dashcam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald a\nPodcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life who are connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned\n[noise] we find [laughter]\nWB easiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief\nUm there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also the sense that this is just one case you know and and the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting ... McDonald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a a stronger response as well from some circles people saying\nYou know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\n[noise] what would you have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that\nDriving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command the jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arriving\nA bit of damaging testimony now you've mentioned in fact the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive policing practices or after\nThe video was released of this shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen\nThere is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case\nThat we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform look like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed\nThere have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none\nOf that has worked so what's going to happen from here\nAt ... she's the host of sixteen shots that's a podcast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke and the shooting death of a crime McDonald she was kind of to join us from WB easy chin thank you so much for talking with human show\nNow we want to head into the barber shop to put a bow and it's incredibly divisive an emotional week in Washington DC the barber shop is where we gather interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their mind so we're going to go back to the major story of the week the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we've been hearing a lot from senators and spokespersons and activists but we wanted to see if we could broaden things out to hear other conversations\nAnd we thought who better to talk to the local radio calling hosted journalists who hear directly from their audience is on a regular basis so we called Liz Redskins she's a reporter with Alaska Public radio who's been closely following one of the most closely watched senators Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski\nWho ultimately decided not to support the Kavanaugh nomination the only Republican not to do so she's here with us from the studios welcome thanks for coming high that Charlie Sykes is with us once again he hosted a conservative political talk show for many years\nOh to be with you\nOkay great I'm Glad to hear and then finally on the phone with us Carrie Miller she is the host an NPR News with Carrie Miller that's at Minnesota Public radio Carrie thank you so much for joining us\nHi Michelle thank you\nAnd let me start by saying that nobody is pretending that this is scientific research but I did want to reach out to all of you because I Know that people your audience is reach out back to you and Kerry I'm going to start with you because you host a call in show when we pulled some tape from it let's just play a little bit of it here and it's\nI think that the Democrats have dark completely crazy I used to be a Democrat or will not be voting Democrat all news going to go Republican all we do a lot it's like we have tons against each other brother or just rather sister sister this is really bad climate that we're in right now\nI I'm very dismayed with a choice of kicking party over morals or character and also I think it was fairly obvious from the proceedings that Kevin I wasn't fully truthful\nTo carry a ... as you can hear you're getting people from all across the political spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us what the comments are falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right or in the show that you're playing the comments from my question to the audience was is what's going on with\nBrett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking of some very competitive races in Minnesota\nAnd I you know I can usually predict\nHow the calls are going to come in what I Am seeing as people are highly engaged and it really knowledgeable about what was happening and they were calling with some unexpected things to say I mean you hear that one caller saying\nI'm disappointed that it's all about party you hear the other caller saying I usually vote democratic this has turned me off and I think that's pretty representative of the calls that I've been getting over the last couple of weeks without\nThis certainly what'll are highly and off their turned off by turned off by the the barrel politics with us\n[noise] generally what about you what are people tweeting new and saying to you and social media and and and uh and elsewhere", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "06"}
