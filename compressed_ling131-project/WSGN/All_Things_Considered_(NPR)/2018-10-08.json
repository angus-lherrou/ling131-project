that found them nothing is that what happened when you don't support public radio this was not a test of any system [laughter]\nThis is just what happened\nThat was a scary little moment when there

ORG\nYou know Audrey I have to admit I was one of those people I thought hey somebody thought that NPR radio was a cool idea and he thought I should have it but instead no someone made that first step so you can go ahead and make that first I just give us a call that one eight hundred for for for\nNine two four six one eight hundred for for for nine two four six and thank you\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I melted Chang President Trump hosts the swearing in ceremony tonight at the White House for the newest justice on the Supreme Court\nBrett Kavanaugh will be on the bench tomorrow when the Supreme Court hold oral arguments he was confirmed over the weekend on a narrow party line vote and today the president told a group of law enforcement officers in Florida that capitals rise to the high court gives Republicans a political boost\nAll over the country of rallies and people are loving that man and loving the jurors\nWill have more on how the political battle over Kavanaugh is affecting the mid term elections in a bit but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley Hey Scott I also get a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shift the decisions will see over the next few decades potentially\nHe will certainly shift the courts are right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federal a society and the Heritage Foundation\nA list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't always about the justice she'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court most famously on a string\nTo be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to Robert to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this shift is a gradual series of rightward steps or one big leap\nDo you think they're very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body it\nIt certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government snapped by partisans in robes rather than an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate\nAlso listen to how President Trump described the campaign against Kevin today\nWas a disgraceful situation\nBrought about by people that are evils any tufted out we'll tufted out together and I have to think the\nRepublican senators that fought so hard for this because it was an easy so you have the president they're talking about this in very partisan terms his press secretary Sarah Sanders also tweeted over the weekend that\nInstead of six three liberal Supreme Court under Hillary Clinton we now have a five for conservative court under President Trump that's certainly true enough but it doesn't exactly sound like neutral referees just calling balls and strikes\nWas already quietly sworn in on Saturday shortly after the Senate confirmed him so what is the purpose of tonight's ceremony at the White House\nThis is a chance for the president to remind his supporters who is responsible for this choice and now in less than two years Trump is named too conservative justices to the Supreme Court\nAnd he's put dozens of conservatives are judges elsewhere on the federal bench so that more than anything has endeared Donald Trump to social conservatives and evangelicals who otherwise might be skeptical of a thrice married billionaire from New York City\nThis hour is so possible you know how does it make you feel though that\nPeople outside of this country\nTo give back to this station but you're right in the in the\nIn the backyard of WB age him and you know it kind of slipped your mind\nDon't be that person give us a call at one eight hundred for for for it nine two four six we

Harris a former Africa advisor to President Obama he says these Chinese loans are also very different from other international loans because the terms are often secret\nWhat we do not have transparency on is what really is the collateral and the very scary case in point is true longer\nJust at the end of last year ... founded soap struggling to pay back its debt so they had that China a strategic port on the Ninety nine year lease so what happens is Judy can't pay back its support what happens if Kenya can't pay back its train the s GR\nOn sets a worry a development economist here in Kenya says the problem is we don't know\nAs a public intellectual who analyzes African in Kenyan economy on a weekly basis at no point how that come across a document that can say oh so that's what he asked young somehow\nAsked the Kenyan government what happens in case of default but they would provide no concrete answer where it says these types of deals\nAre also clearly a source of income for corrupt politicians and their supporters but lately here in Kenya there has\nBeen public outcry African governments need me happy with the city but Africa but I'm not and fundamentally the sentiments on the ground is really going to inform how successful and how will receive their initiatives are in the country as a home [noise]\nOr train makes it on time to buy some strategically important port on the Indian Ocean\nWe drive out of the station onto the wetlands across tall bridges on brand new paved roads all made by the Chinese\nChinese workers do past us pick up and trying to think those are houses there and to me and also the sides behind twelve foot fences and guard towers we see apartment threat lanterns tell us they are Chinese dwellings\nWe end up at the top of a bluff Charles ... door is a driver like a lot of others here he thought he'd one day be working on the railroad but these days he says he's not even allowed in the gate to try to find work\nI asked him if he's ever spoken to one of the changes that were never there [noise] why maybe I Know he says the Chinese have type cast them they think that all Kenyans are good for is to clean or to move rocks for construction\nOf building but if I was a dog on the Web and those that are good or does that now what are we got that right or do we got more than what they're doing there\nHe feels like something that was supposed to bring jobs that was supposed to bring pride instead belong to someone else in ... NPR News ...\n[noise]\nTomorrow we continue our series on how China is changing the world will visit in Mandarin Chinese language school in Pakistan [noise]\nBoy do I mean I'm learning\nChinese so that I could have got a job has been my brothers and sisters to get aid to fish here how China is making cultural inroads into Pakistan in transforming a decades old strategic relationship between the two countries that's tomorrow here on all things considered\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News\nWhen the Greek debt crisis had many European officials worded letting a Chinese shipping companies or go to work on some European observers have regrets\nFounder if they if they're in order to do they find they find that\nThey would talk [noise]\nThat's tomorrow morning from five to nine right here on your NPR station Ninety point three WB H M\nI listen to WHM on my lap because I'm able to take it wherever I go [noise]\nThe\nBest part is I could take it with me when I travel to different offices I guess we'll start my morning the same way and even if I'm driving home back to Mississippi I can plug my phone into my car and still receive the same programming\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily yard of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore [laughter] really surprised me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last few years there has kind of been\nThat steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posted that really lengthy\nAlmost like a scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming midterms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so [laughter]\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well you tell us with did start out as like\nDoes have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\n[noise] I think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world\nShe didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and she'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nNow this is what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day\nAnd [laughter] I always had that I had her mind from Italy exactly\nTaylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of has like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she'd just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's on with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of looted in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out unless you didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her\nSexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\nEmily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post thanks very much for joining us today I think you\nKnow this is all things considered from NPR News\nAnd [noise] and\nMy name is our Richards I live in montebello with my wife and we've supported WBAI gym for about two years now we love listening to MORNING EDITION and all things considered and it just it really drove their day\n\nThe climate that we live and I think it's so important that we have access to good solid information and we have found\nOf looking at both sides of an issue and then delivering information that is unbiased and is accurate\nAnd when you live in a generation or live in a time when the news that you get through Facebook is you know Ninety percent of it or or something is fake news you know you really need to make sure that you have good reliable information and that's one of the big reasons we support public radio\nThe other thing is is the quality of the programming that we get not just the news but also the fun stuff that happens on the weekends like wait wait don't tell me it really enriches and enhances are a lot\n\nMore people listen to public radio than our supporters\nI think people just assume that public radio or something that's just going to be there that they'll swap over to WB H M and listen to the news reports one day and the next day they'll just be there and they don't have to worry about supporting it and that's just not the case\nIt's a great radio station

matter entirely\nRound the gold fine with the AIDS project in Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit is already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington Maria Sanchez is still on the fence\nTo reform the entire treatment service component before we can talk about a safe injection site as a pool within four\nA recent visit to Kensington the desperation was everywhere syringes and drug bags strewn across sidewalks and train platforms people nodding off in front of homes next to Delhi's leaning against park cars\nThis is how forty two year old ray describes it for using just his first name because he uses illegal opioids so I've been to ground zero\nThe Phillies baseball cap of that he says he'd go to the supervised injection sites because right now he uses next door stuff in our way back yard or

Administration\nSo be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise] it's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would jus really quite well with well controlled facial images that when the elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better\nAt the task you know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen yeah this is a really excellent point the current ...\nImages of a particular person and an accurate label\nAnd so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make\nThe Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes\nOh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple\nIf you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse\nWhether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility is something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you

pledged us support right now one eight hundred for for for nine two four six or you can give on line at W. ... thank you\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm outfit Chang\nPresident Trump hosts the swearing in ceremony tonight at the White House where the newest justice on the Supreme Court\nBrett Kavanaugh will be on the bench tomorrow when the Supreme Court holds oral arguments he was confirmed over the weekend on a narrow party line vote and today the president told a group of law enforcement officers in Florida that Kavanaugh's rise to the high court gives Republicans a political boost\nAll over the country of rallies and people are loving that man and loving that\nYours will have more on how the political battle over canonize affecting the mid term elections in a bed but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley Hey Scott I also see a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shift the decision will see over the next few decades potentially\nHe will certainly shift according to the right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federalist society and the Heritage Foundation a list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't always say about the justice she'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy\nKennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court most famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to Robert to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this\nShift is a gradual series of rightward steps or one big leap\nDo you think the very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body\nIt certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government staffed by partisans in robes rather than an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate\nYou should brought about by people that are evils\nAnd he left it out we'll tufted out together and I have to think\nThe Republican senators that fought so hard for this because it was an easy so you have the president they're talking about this in very partisan terms his press secretary Sarah Sanders also tweeted over the weekend that instead of six three liberal Supreme Court under Hillary Clinton we now have a five for conservative court under President Trump that's\nCertainly true enough but it doesn't exactly sound like neutral referee just calling balls and strikes\nNo Kavanaugh was already quietly sworn in on Saturday shortly after the Senate confirmed him so what is the purpose of tonight's ceremony at the White House\nThis is a chance for the president to remind his supporters who is responsible for this choice and now in less than two years Trump is named too conservative justices to the Supreme Court\nAnd he's put dozens of conservatives are judges elsewhere on the federal bench so that more than anything has endeared Donald Trump to social conservatives and evangelicals who otherwise might be skeptical of a thrice married billionaire from New York City\nUp to the minute news that's available whenever you want it we hope that's worth your investment right now at W. B. A. dot O. R.

entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nMay not know what's gonna happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat in a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats Phil Bredesen\nBut black burn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how on earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been\nThe steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posed with really link the almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response than like from her fans\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now still does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\n[noise] I think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd now this is what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day and [laughter] I always said I had her mind for mentally Beckley Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of\nStrategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd like she didn't stay with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in a meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\n[noise] Emily yard is an entertainment

destruction to coral reefs previous research predicted these effects if the earthworms by two degrees Celsius\nBut this report finds the consequences could actually come much sooner when the earthworms by one and a half degrees Celsius which is on track to happen in just about Twenty years\nThe un included data from over six thousand scientific studies\nAnd one of those studies came from the nonprofit think tank climate interactive where Andrew Jones is the cofounder welcome thank you thank you also someone just make this clear this report is predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous reports had been predicting but this report says these consequences will happen sooner\nYeah that's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck with the urgency and they really laid out which such precision the hearing now element of this problem and not do it for the grandkids\nSo many of these effects that you just mentioned sit around twenty forty also if you want to plan to be here around twenty I order and they do yeah so what this is a kind of sharing now impacts the scientists were writing about\nSo what would it take to avert this I mean this report is saying we basically have a deadline coming up in about Twenty years are are real changes feasible within that timeframe\nAbsolutely like this you hear some of those studies ... and ... it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatch them Netflix but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really something to extend what humans were made for and the report lays out really well if we're willing to take on the kind of efforts that we have in the past and\nHumans have done it also and in World War two\nFlying to the moon yeah rebuilding Europe after the plague took out of\nI don't last that was going to point out you wrote an op ed in the New York times the other day which you compared to seemingly insurmountable task of confronting climate change to do things like winning World War two or achieving civil rights but was that supposed to be reassuring because you do make the challenge seem awfully daunting\nWell it is daunting and we get to kind of remember our humanity and what we have pulled off in the past these amazing things where humans have faced impossibility and the scientific report laid out really well what we get to do\nAnd it's no silver bullet it is this mix of\nA bike to build communities plant based diet it's that kind of all across the board no silver bullet but silver buckshot all of these actions together so this is the big challenging and World War two task in front of us I think we're up to it and the report says if we did it all we could technically\nReached that goal of living in

when they hope to open their doors but one thing is clear they say is getting people like ray off the streets\nAnd into a medical facility means defined the Trump Administration so be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise] it's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at\nOur bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good an house a cue or is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the universe\nUp a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know a change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better\nAt the task you know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nJust wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh the answer to the question\nTechnologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate there are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could uses technology to target undocumented immigrants\nAnd where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University

for joining us at six thirty [noise]\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry had been\nOrganizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there and if nothing else labeling\nAnd as he does these ...\nThere were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and so there's this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights of spam decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments once that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when outsell a silicon said went out bore acts went out we arsenic without dry you really see government stepping up for some of these outlet extremely dangerous compound\nIs this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant\nUnknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk but it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story I'm a single person\nWho changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember that someone who is focused than even obsessive and and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book

double digit lead in the polls nationally Republicans don't expect the race to affect the balance of power in the Senate\nThe worry now is whether it could affect the balance of power in the house as

eighty percent of the people who identifies Republicans\nFarnsworth says this close to election day expects that number to be above Ninety percent and\nThat lower level of support for Corey Stewart
