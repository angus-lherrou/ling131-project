California when police stopped him\nSo er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone you wouldn't you described those things you might not\nHave sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAnd I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worth\nAbout what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty that aren't as connected as she doesn't mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and ... story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who um shouted by the root causes and story they needed to be told\nThat's about ... uh Kobe she's the sister of genetic do uh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she was took it for her home\nAnd of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone a Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nPlease don't like that\n[noise] what are you serious you know obviously had no\nVoice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over epicenters of African Burger King materials and volatile confrontations with law\nFor me it's still end up going to steal he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to find a baby or expectations of citizens and police officers and what's lost here\nIs that people are thinking the legislation just focus on citizens wallet does it and it doesn't just focus on a video a video camera sets the stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get\nWhile they're in the academy and the fact that the length of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the text to what appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a primer you know if we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that\nBut the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations of police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and pick at who was cast in the ... I Can't\nI Can't forgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that use that spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the ten cent why would you let let\nLet me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective\nWas to find a mechanism by which we could establish behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations are citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights or I thought put it in schools and making the mandatory was a great place to put it also also driver's license coast\nA petition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both how do we make certain that there is content that deals with the bias piece\nHow do we make certain that police departments that they have psychological examinations in front of the unconscious bias or an edge to just try to race as best possible the buyers ... I'm not sure that they say that this is going to be a panacea because it's not\nIt's not but I think that it's a step in the right direction in order to make sure that we know what the ... patients are police officers and citizens during Trevor going around\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines President Trump today says he isn't satisfied with Saudi Arabia's response to the death of journalists Jamal could show gee Trump also says it's possible the crown prince was unaware of the killing you know it says ... died in a fistfight\nMexican authorities have allowed a second group of about forty five migrants to be processed at the border with Guatemala and has started giving some people forty five day visitor permits Mexico's only allowing those with the visa or a passport in others are applying for refugee status in Mexico\nAustralia center right government is lost one seat majority in parliament in a ... election in Sydney today and independent candidate has prevailed I'm Janine hurts NPR News in Washington [noise]\n\nDo\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build a more just an equitable world learn more at age eight W.

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd what you've probably heard about the federalist society is Roland during that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group ...\nAnd they all expenses paid program these clerks which you keep the training secret and signed something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us is going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut she spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve in something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials\nFor any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what do you get to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties on to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\n... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people and just sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others\nTo learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction but not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pie\nHas been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at death um creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nAnd to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably fine\nBut also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not fine\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when your piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close now it's about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee\nThey wouldn't say who the donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating ...\nWhich suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form it's entirely possible use that's at um attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in London or does he shows and let me just say that we realize at the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week that you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show after it start Roseanne Barr too\n... we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery then it was just I'd be pro it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about it so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us\nPleasure to be here myself like you also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online chef welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back here and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it\nYou know it's really interesting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming and a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide the inside right\nAnd the struggle case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and potentially lead to this behavioral change so there was a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world or culture guide though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI Know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of Roseanne was was powerful so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job actually addressing a very difficult topic\nSame I Know you're not a critic but you're deeply immersed in covering this crisis okay and I just wondered if you felt about it as a person who knows a lot about the realities of the situation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things
