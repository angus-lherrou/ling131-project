Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe so when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the\nTrees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood at\nA here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses resist in rubble some it already taken a hit economically but uh\nBut this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under washed them and a half an hour yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now just single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nGo out and and I mentioned these two towns are the harder the oyster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... along the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most votes escaped major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida Today and all this week Greg thanks so much you walk them\nAll right let's move now to the political storm that had correct Washington in the country last week it is a storm that has calmed down now Brett Kavanaugh is now justice capping off but the fun out from the bitter and divisive battle over his confirmation is still defining political conversation\nBy giving us a call at one eight hundred for for for nine two\nFour six our staffers and volunteers are standing by waiting for your call and it's super easy you when you call you going to be like wow that really was easy ... wasn't mine [laughter] no I'm not I don't do that one eight hundred\nFor for for nine two four six is the number thank you so much\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July President Trump\nYet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place in what exactly had been convicted up\nWhile he's pastor ran a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why really ... him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation and they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey\nIf this was far from the only one Syria and other things possible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWere my name is when Holleman brown I've been listening to W. B. gym for years I have a Chinese pug and he loves to listen to [noise]\n\nI found that he didn't get it wants him and he didn't do ... things while we were gone if I left the radio on [noise] so I came back one afternoon from a thing on on the air and and\nHe had torn up top all the way from the back door the bedroom\nAnd he's such a sweet dog never does things like that and I thought oh my goodness what in the world was angry about something what did we do and I said what's the why did you do that and\nI realized I had not lifted radio and I leave the radio on NPR all day long we're not going out and\nI'm I'm looking at my watch and it was three twenty I went oh my gosh he's missed the first twenty minutes of all things considered no wonder he's upset with me [noise]\nIf you count on NPR like this dog [laughter] give us a call at one eight hundred for for for nine two four six or you can give on line at W.

B. H M dot org thank you [noise]\n\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm also Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse while at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades and in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro birds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for trial\nSo I'm going to ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living\nEvery single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nWith respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOh comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two\nFifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church that there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the heads so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children\nI think there is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\nI it's Steve Inskeep with MORNING EDITION from NPR News here to deliver you a basic reality you can't always trust what you read after a five seconds search on the Internet and the fact is that if you're going to be a journalist if you're going to be a reporter if you're going to learn something that's meaningful and pass it on to others\nYou need to take the time to go where the story is whether that story is in Murray, Kentucky or in Washington DC or Libya or Egypt or Iran you need to go there you need to see for yourself that takes time that takes money and not a lot of news organizations are willing to pay any more\nPublic radio listeners are willing to pay the people who use this public radio service support this public radio service they know that this public radio station benefits them and benefits this community and so they support it which is the way it should be all you have to say I'm a listener\nAnd I want to contribute and if you want to\nFor the information that you hear each and every day from this radio station is it worth some ... some amount to you ask yourself that question and if the answer is yes pick up that phone give us a call one eight hundred for for for nine two four six\nI'm In studio with Audrey Atkins our director of community engagement\nRight in the middle of our challenge right\nIt is we are it is a dollar for dollar challenge going on right now that means you can essentially double your money now where else are you don't get a deal like that this weekend double your money\nThat made I mean that's like a buy one get one yeah yeah like you buy our of all things considered you get an hour of all things

B. age him we check those facts we find sources and we bring you the reporting that's both thorough and thoughtful\nThat's a good reason to start making a donation ride it sure is I mean you don't want\nPeople to tell you what your opinion should be you want to get all the facts and determine what your own opinions are for yourself\nAnd that's why people listen to people tell me all the time that they love to listen to public radio because it's like a quiet faces the space\nWhere they can gather up information and form their own thoughts\nAnd that's important if that's important to you call right now one eight hundred for for for nine two four six and make a donation here's another thing when you turn on your radio no pay wall know even if you turn on XM Radio you're paying your but when you turn on money point three of them are when you go to our\nOr when you listen on your Alexa there is no pay while there I was looking at an article the other day it was company so interesting

neighbors I Charlie Hill and Birmingham, Alabama and Gloria camera and had given this hour thank you both very much for your contribution\nDouble your money like they did and here comes Jane based more to\nCall right now one eight hundred for for for nine two four\nSix in is a challenge our we're looking for ten thousand dollars but we're down to eight right Audrey yeah a little less than ... now All right we're looking for a thousand dollars there's ten thousand dollars on the table up for grabs and we just need your help to get it\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today\nThank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its minister ration often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known\nPrivate lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials happened defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has\nTo be able to defend itself or with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using information using the institutions\nWell insulated I Do get concern that if the president keeps substance attacks and others drawing them and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome also thank you for having me on [noise]\nHey it's Peter said will hear from a wait wait don't tell me you're listening to the pledge drive I'm listening to the pledge drive and

B. agenda to work\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey at court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well and here's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nHis best or rent a small church and is near and western turkey for years and years a\nBut after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or\nSuddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why really ... him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nAnd they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to the Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing this stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe democracy she'll get case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\nThanks Peter You're welcome that I'm director belong an armored WBAI each member\nParts of my day literally rough all\nAround her WBUR term in our town\nIs worth something to me I mean I'm always like a little finance\nAnd dollars ... year old was our contributor\nTo actively purchase of her or support in something you love it always [noise] if you love listening to NPR should\nGo there because of the\nNoise ... will not be afraid [noise]\nCall one eight hundred for for for nine or ... or go to W. ... dot org\n[noise]\nBecome an active listener right now give us a call at one eight hundred for for for it nine two four six don't wait donate [laughter]\nThis is Dee Dee Dee ban hello everybody the challenge\nThe rest of this hour is a really good one it's a dollar for dollar your donations matched dollar for dollar\nSo this is the time if you've been waiting for that time when you want to make your contribution count extra extra extra ah go ahead and do it now this is it right now eight hundred for for for\nNine two four six or W.

this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report\nPennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro birds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm going to ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their parishioners but I I Do not think\nThat the people in Pennsylvania will accept that anyone\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them well and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living\nEvery single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass
