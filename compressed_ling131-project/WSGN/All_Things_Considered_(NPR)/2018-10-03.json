Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow does he get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where were you surprised so I don't remember I'm going to go on and today the\nWhite House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nVoter just alone is very compelling a woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be hearing to which was\nMore corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote\nNow Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote you know one thing that has\nBeen swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nIn one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted cheered\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened therefore so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nBut how his supporters react\nAnd his supporters by in large seemed to have stuck with him\nThrough the allegations against him even if they find those allegations distasteful\nGood afternoon it's three

industry are breathing a sigh of relief this week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some\nAnd which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered\nThank you very glad to be with you\nTo begin with well you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding a rough to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend\nWe're cautiously optimistic that the terms agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required for parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs\nThere's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nUs so all of that will impact our members\nAnd then the Jewish and there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be ... material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry to knock on the way\nYou know they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some ...\nOn but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA is it an improvement just is it worse well\nI think from the United states perspective when the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral ... that's from North America and our vehicles the biggest concern our members are going to have to see a ministry of cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because\nConsumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior

the mid eighties it was covered with a cap to keep Iran from washing out more toxins\nFor years this put the public fears to rest then amid news of the cancer cluster in twenty sixteen workers made an alarming discovery high levels of pee fast chemicals and surface waters around the landfill since then traces of these industrial toxins have also turned up in nearby wells\nOfficials are still working to pinpoint where the chemicals come from and they may never be sure what caused the cancer cluster but ... chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer so

families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of I don't believe the press they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere was no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child and our care for any parent\nHa just by the way cared for children after they were separated wild da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children a central\nDatabase did the inspector general fine that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central\nWhen distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\n... are there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents [noise]\nOh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Jill You're welcome [laughter]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMontana has become a popular campaign stop for President Trump and vice president Pence so popular that each of them has been there twice in recent months that's because Republicans are trying to unseat two term democratic Senator Jon tester\nDuring Pence's second visit there yesterday he fired up a rally talking about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court Montana Public Radio's Eric Whitney reports\nIn a state that President Trump won by more than twenty points tester emphasizes that you can work with Trump he's run an ad listing Nineteen bills he's supported\nThe latest allegations of fully investigated\nSenator Jones has already announced his voting no unjust L just like even though an Joes or test or didn't take a position on Kavanaugh's confirmation until after last week's hearings were over and then came out against Kavanaugh\nCiting first his record on privacy issues and support for the Patriot act\nFor those reasons and all of the reasons that were brought up last week um I made a decision to vote no on judge Kaplan I don't think he has the merits nor the a background to uh meet the needs of the Supreme Court\nRepublican challenger Matt Rosendale says he'd be a more reliable ally for President Trump and cited the Supreme Court vote as an example\nMyself and a lot of people across this nation or very disturbed with the way this entire process was handled there is a man who has a commendable record and he should be serving on the bench an absolutely I Would vote for him\nOn paper standing firmly with President Trump would appear to be a winning strategy in Montana the population here skews older and wider than the U.S in general Montana also has the second highest population of veterans per capita of any state guys like Jim hunting film [noise]\nRetired after Twenty years in the navy ending felt now volunteers at the airport in Missoula helping arriving tourists he voted for President Trump\nYou're going to mess around with this country we're going to do something as no crossing the line a red line we're going to do it\nWhile heading failed says he hell no didn't vote for President Obama like many Montana voters he isn't easy to pigeon hole he says he's voted for tester before and for Democratic governors Steve bullock in twenty sixteen\nAnd he says a candidate support for the president or testers vote on Kavanaugh's nomination won't sway his choice\nNo because I don't use it as a platform to make my decision\nStill plenty of voters do see their vote as a sign of support for President Trump Bozeman retirees Suzie burden was at a senior community center yesterday near where vice president Pence was holding his campaign rally well\nI think a press and giving marvelously actually he keeps his promises\nAnd not many of them do\nPresident Trump is front and center in the Senate race here identity and local issues\nMontana could be privatized Rosendale\nInitially opposed federal land ownership but says he's now convinced that that's not what people want\nAnd test her leans hard on his image as a third generation farmer Rosendale moved to the state in two thousand two after a career as a Marilyn real estate developer voters will be watching closely Saturday as the to debate one last time before early voting starts later this month for\nNPR News I'm Eric Whitney in Missoula, Montana [noise]\nBird\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\n[noise] [noise] Mm\nIt's three forty eight good afternoon thanks for joining us for all things considered from NPR and W.

parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk

read you my my favorite response job please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I had never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled\nI asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next\nComfort semper fi well\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good

now I'm rethinking\nWas that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time because of what we're hearing and the the Kavanaugh Ford hearings because their fathers have said something like\nI'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened

saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there is evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\nRuss ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me or the New York times story you just heard it now says they were able to get away with the tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax bonding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years that doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades is simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively\nAnd years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nAffect us that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue so to the extent the IRS has resource as they are not going to be allocating at tort get tax and force not\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York's\nLong to do so that peers to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel heart decades [laughter]\nWhen it comes to a transactions along on the family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years pro public eye has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do\nBut the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe assess the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on or turn means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS finds evidence of wrongdoing severe assess it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nGood afternoon I'm

Jim good evening it's five six [noise]\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'd also Chang in the weeks since Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you just don't remember where was the place I don't remember how many you don't want to I don't know [noise] and today in\nThe White House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nOr just the motor users can do as a woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be hearing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but\nA lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nActually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct absolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him\nBut that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nIn one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise laughed at cheered\nAnd you know he was really he really seemed to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nBut how his supporters react\nAnd his supporters by and large seemed to have stuck with him\nThrough the allegations against him even if they find those allegations distasteful\nSupport for NPR terms from this

we'll send is senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how comparison after for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required for parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs\nThere's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum [noise]\nAh so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be ... material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry and not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA\nAnd be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is it worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have to see a ministry of cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the mode on equipment Manufacturers

[noise]\nThis is all things\nConsidered from NPR News\nCome as early as friday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell wants it to happen this week though he hasn't scheduled at yet he and the rest of the Senate or waiting on the FBI to finish its investigation of sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh\nThree Republicans who could determine the judges said say they need to see that FBI report first before they make up their minds with this now to talk about the latest as NPR's Scott Detrow who joined us from Capitol Hill has got a elsewhere\nSo senators are saying the FBI could complete this report and send it to them as soon as today which would be early because the FBI was given a full week to do this\nDoes this speed to give us any clues about the scope of the report\nWhat we got one clue in the scope just just a while earlier today we know now that the FBI has not yet talked to one key witness and that's Christine balls e Ford her lawyer say as of today she has not been contacted by the FBI\nA lot of top Republicans are fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican as he got into an elevator earlier today\nGoing over there when we heard from members of course referring to last week public testimony a Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said something similar\nDemocrats say this makes no sense that the whole point of following up was to confirm or dispel what Ford and Kavanaugh said so the FBI should follow up here's Democrat Richard Blumenthal who's a former attorney general\nLeads are followed the interviews create additional questions [noise] sometimes they're re interviews that's very common [noise] and that's an investigation it's got to be more than just check the box okay we have their accounts [noise]\nOkay so clearly there is a big split between Republicans and Democrats are talking about this that split was even more parent last night President Trump spoke at a rally and he mocked Christine Blasey Ford's testimony against Kavanaugh let's let's take a listen to a bit of that\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years

... Dr Ford were wholly\nInappropriate and in my view unacceptable for taking everything into account is is the key framing their Murkowski has made it clear she thinks a big part of this is treating women with respect listening tone to them when they come forward with allegations who she is certainly someone to watch if the president keeps attacking Ford head on\nAnd they have any of these key senators said anything about the scope of the FBI investigation and whether or not hearing from either cabinet or Ford again is a problem\nFlake said earlier that there should be about knowing what there is to know and trying to answer questions not checking a box as for the very latest little unclear because it's hard to talk to them right now because they're the center of attention\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from constant contact who's email marketing tools help small businesses and nonprofits connect with their customers learn more constant contact dot com\nFrom Baird of financial partner guiding families businesses communities and institutions since Nineteen Nineteen R.

considered ... and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories many for the first time\nWashington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox and her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you many people have been sharing this column on line and I spoke with Monica has to be about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I have never told as my dad I don't think he could handle this and what did\nThey tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry ... someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well [noise] I did get responses\nFrom people concerned about telling their mothers but I think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of women said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what\nThere is in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\n[noise] you know just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery story that he can ever make we do that with ... and we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on a spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the response was that you have to call them since it was published this week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response job please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her had this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled\nI asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon\nNot today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi well\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads\nThey're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking\nWas that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations\nFathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and that they have enough for hearings because their fathers have said something like\nI'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago\nAnd I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...

would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those\nOr is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today Thanks for having me or\nThe New York times story you just heard it now says the trumps were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI Do think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have a self serving valuations that are on the ... side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades and simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no with only one in a hundred tax returns is now audited\nAnd Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue so to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat appears to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions involving the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen but because Trump hasn't\nReleased his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it\nAnd to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations but severe says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe assess it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThere's a new mandate for corporations
