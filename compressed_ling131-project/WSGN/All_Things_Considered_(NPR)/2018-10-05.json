position and old lynx lead for speech is already just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speeches it kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically we're saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that and she did that for more than forty minutes and she

assault\nYet she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward in a Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault but she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief and the presumption of innocence and

Connecticut implications for wages there\nAre signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down to slow the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate the White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures would build\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates that said you know look I'm getting too low to have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and test content\nYou said many other economists it would start to swear among the other one would go along for a while to get low and Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they dollhouse John Ydstie NPR News Washington\n[noise] Mm [noise] Mm [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm\n[noise] [noise] and you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm\nIt's three forty eight good afternoon in Happy Friday thanks for joining us for all things considered from NPR and W.

convincing that a doctor Ford was\nAnd yet they reached a conclusion that there was no credible evidence to suggest her statement with a hundred percent certainty that Brett Kavanaugh was her attacker was the fact\nWhat Susan said yesterday at the end the FBI investigation she thought it was a thorough investigation I knew we were in trouble\nOr they interviewed eight ten people no more they ignored eight witnesses produced by Dr Ford twenty witnesses produced by Mr Amir as it was not a full some incomplete professional investigation by any means\nI also want to ask about Senator Joe

Kavanaugh is now one step away from a seat on the Supreme Court looks like he has the votes he needs to be confirmed in a final vote\nTomorrow this afternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy floor speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this\nIs the presumption of innocence and fairness you bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nThen for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believed the charges against Kavanaugh should not prevent him from serving on the Supreme Court her conclusion\nMr President I Will vote chicken for judge Kavanaugh\nMinutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee or we're gonna bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell she is on Capitol Hill she has been tracking all of this back and forth today ... either high so I Would ask him just a second a little bit more about what senator Collins said but first just the headline\nIs there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out\nWell now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they had the fifty one goes to the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing couldn't happen between now and that could happen you know we have to keep those catty odds going but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and that means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA role that he might have had to play had it had it not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins as she laid out her position and old lynx lead for speeches or you just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote yes\nAlice I'm she basically we're saying that he is not that extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is and she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed in that she did that for more than forty minutes\nAnd she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there well she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her well she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew what was coming to me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault\nYet she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and ah Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nBut she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was cabinet ... who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief in the presumption of innocence and she spoke about that quite a bit um and about the idea that this isn't a trial but that due process is still something she believes in\nTold me a little bit more is someone who was at the Capitol today watching this historic they unfold what was the scene\nGood evening

today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot liquid McDonald sixteen times\nIt was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force\nWB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell acted as I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something\nWe haven't will happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police\nLike the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will move for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described with chronic Donald as somebody to be afraid of he described his face as a frightening described his eyes blank\nOn he said that ah that that was ... raised in life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the ... video up there and\nYeah what kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's\nYou'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there's another trial would lead it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald at present it that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think we'd be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that as\nWe've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shots sixteen made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the comic Donald and chose not to shoot I\nThink that that was important to a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago

reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time is on I had\nBy the way he acted like in ... I think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position\nWhere he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right [laughter] they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice rally foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question\nThat she found the tactics of some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up or when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because he was mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night and the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what Thanksgiving should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had it\nTo spiking women's strengths and sorting gang rape if that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\n[laughter] you know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political pinch to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer and Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U. S. unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate\nI think it's a huge deal\nAnd house says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from employers if they can't find workers that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... could implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages the September ... jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year\nBut lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down this load the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically\nYours are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate the White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts in trade\nFormer President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero here\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates and said you know what I'm getting too old you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they\nStart to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent and they never would've allowed her to get the slow\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington\n[noise]\nYou're

went looking to trace the arc of this me to moment we're living through you'd be hard pressed to come up with better bookends than the following today the U.S Senate voting to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and moved to a final vote despite allegations of sexual assault and has passed\nAnd one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen when we sent that out into the world\nDidn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were recording on below\nAn investigation what it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt pretty like to say as we were working on it he said hurting wines dean is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not\nA household name 'em and and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to\nBurn out or you know the women were all then a simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger let me ask you this if\nKavanaugh is confirmed with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that what especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also saw moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop the national conversation for a second and say\nListen to these stories\n[noise] one footnote to this conversation before I let you go Judy we just heard there from our reporter Shariah so hard enough and but today also marks the order of the Nobel Peace prize prize is often Juno sending a political message\nUm and their word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you go to the global scope of this me to\nMoment the EU hopes and motion a year ago\nI woke up to the same news and had\nAnd also media reminder perspective at a moment when we are all so immersed in the cabinet news maybe this
