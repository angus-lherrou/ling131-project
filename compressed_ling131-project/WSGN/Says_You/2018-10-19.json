{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WSGN", "content": "Seven years ago a mother of two named Korean Bobby in Phoenix started at a very different place from Jeff genes body and independent remembers her other relief the day the AC a marketplace first went live\nThe weight that was lifted when the rollout happened I cried and I am not an emotional person and I I went on the market place and I saw that we can I cried when that Bobby\nRight outside her children's school and to understand just why the A. C. A. was such a godsend to her you first need to understand something about her daughter\nSofia was born with what's called complex congenital heart disease or they'll call it ... the ... and then she also had the\nSome of her organs are in the wrong place all of which means staggering medics or in the wrong place missing or most\nOf the ... already ... million dollar husband didn't have health insurance through work so Obamacare gave them hope during a pretty dark time at least for a while\nBut about three years into a ca coverage ... started having problems getting the health care she needed\nAre specialists were changing she wasn't able to get prescriptions that she was totally able to get before and then by I think like the for the year we started to notice that that providers are pulling out of the marketplace every year they just started dropping like flies\nBy twenty Seventeen Maricopa County where body lives with down to just one health insurers innocent tire marketplace [noise]\nOkay at this point in our conversation school let out and kids start spilling into the street in front of us by the way that Sophia which one is\nShe is she's coming out of the blue backpack I fear okay\nJust fear is now a ... ten year old with a huge smile gliding home on a hot pink scooter I really hate walking [noise]\nWhy why is walking so bad it's just hurts my legs but writing a scooter could be really risky now because remember how Maricopa County had only one ensure left on its exchange\nWill turns out the hospital that always treated Soviet terminated its contract with that one ensure\nAnd Bobby decided staying with those doctors was important so she cancelled the families plan under the ace EA which means the Bobby's don't have any health insurance right now while I'm thinking what happens when some emergency housing right with Sophia exactly\nSo really know what what is your what is that right now it literally what I say it's okay we'll cross that bridge if they come to it like I don't have a backup plan right now\nBecause I feel it's terrifying it's absolutely terrifying Bobby's hoping this will be temporary she will have more options for coverage during the next open enrollment period in November\nBut when she thinks about how hopeful she was when Democrats rolled out the a CIA she says what she didn't see at the time we're all the puck marks underneath the make up when you hear Democrats cheering about it applauding themselves are passing it is there's some a little\nI'm waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting\nWaiting for what some facts sense things would be amazing ... says she doesn't know exactly what that fix should be but she knows she wants to see Republicans and Democrats working together to come up with some compromise\nAnd she says this is the single most important issue for her in this entire mid term election\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nI have a question for you how do you decide what has value I'm\nGuy Raz host of the radio hour from NPR and on our show we recently looked at the idea of value and why it is we like the things we like\nI think in general are our experiences or modulated not just by our senses but by our beliefs this is Paul bloom I'm a professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University\nAnd a lot of his work is focused on how human beings decide what's valuable and what isn't\nSomeone isn't mistaken when they pay extra money for the better known brand because it might lead to extra\nPleasure but but how do we decide I mean how do we decide what has value\nSo he could value things for different reasons you could value them because of their utility or what they could do for you you know so golf clubs can you play golf with them um you know a suit you could wear\nBut things get value in other ways as well and often they get value because of their history and so we we get pleasure from\nSometimes from knowing what something is\nAnd knowing where it came from [noise]\nAnd our experiences transformed in that way [noise]\nSo if what we like is affected by what we believe then I have another question for you [noise] do you value what you hear in public radio every day do you\nBelieve it brings richness to your life do you listen and learn new things about human behavior in science and the economy\nBut if
