[noise]\n\nSo it's funny in the journal fiction um it is I mean people it is a dirty victory but it's not a comic no that's right\nThat's right I mean I think the the sort of instinct for the book was um you know teach in a college and I spend a lot of time trying to pay attention to what's happening in the world and there was a moment in or\nAround the time of like Occupy Wall street them after where a lot of identity politics were just kinda roiling everyone and and I think that can be okay but some of the rhetoric started to feel\nScary word but it made me a little itchy and I didn't know why but for the book I think I wanted to just ask the question was like what would be really intractable aspect of identity generational conflict and then what would it look like to just spend a couple of years trying to play that out of my head\nSo after mark washes out during the great\nAnd talk about generation gaps to me at the time ... was the epitome of cheesy and David and square which is exactly how Paul folks felt about the show was a kid\n... now teaches media in communication at New York university and the colleges Staten Island and for our future called guilty pleasures he talks about how his opinion shifted a hundred and eighty degrees [noise]\nAs a kid I remember my grandfather a cattle farmer in South eastern Iowa he was a very quiet man\nHas to turn would be that would be the best word I remember\nProbably Saturday evening is when\nHe watch TV when Laurence welk came on\nWe're happy you could join us that we have a full menu of champagne music gentleman went to\nThe first thing of course is the hair the over the top hair styles that sets were just so you know so colorful and the costumes of course are full color and then\nThe singing they're just so sincere and of course today sincerity is not hip not [noise]\nYou see that that's part of what what's great\nI call it my guilty pleasure\nBut I don't feel about it actually I think\nIt's cool the whole idea of camp is your perspective more than the actual content so you can watch it as camp you can watch it in in this ironic fashion\nThat's something that I still enjoy it in this ironic fashion I find it hilarious still but I came to love it is more than something to laugh at\nOur very fine according to spy on the floor and all of the champagne music makers chime in with that all time favorite stumbling fun to [noise]\nFirst thing you notice about Lawrence Welk as he has this really strange\nEnglish wasn't his first language in Sherman was his first language and that's why he has this weird access\nI felt a little bit kind of have a little water before it on the show\nHe carried the baton and he played the accordion\n\n\nThis is what's so great about the show is there's this connection to people's immigrant\nDiversion America happened famously many fields government education entertainment and here's one Irish men who is pretty well known for his grade attend our boys of course I'm speaking of our own Joe feeding of course I\nPlay into whatever their immigrant past cliche so he's wearing a green suit and you singing my Irish rose\n\n\nThere's this point where he holds the microphone for him to kind of\nGet him to raise his voice to a higher note [noise]\n\nSo there's this great rapport between them\nAnd then at the end he says listen to the\nExtent that night that he would let a German player for an Irishman\nHere [noise] referring to himself\nAs a German but of course is a German American there's a recognition that America of course is the land of ... of immigrants this is something that has been often lost in our contemporary rural America I think\nIf the gentleman I'm wearing the official jacket of the future farmers of America\nThis is a ... and he's the Norwegian when Laurence welk refers to him\nThis is a national organization of some four hundred thousand high school boys on the farming areas of America\nAnd this is a group that every kid that grew up in a small town like my father my father was a member would belong to the expectation of course was that that you would become a farmer eventually as well [noise]\nYou know since the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies rural America has emptied out\nThe town that my father grew up in er my grandfather farmed it's a ghost town that's why there's a certain melancholy to this show and to the program [noise]\n\nOr one of the act I remember on the Lawrence Welk show is the tap dancer or their Duncan was one of the first African Americans on broadcast\nTV [noise] [noise]\nSo here Arthur Duncan is tap dancing [noise]\nThe women are singing and looking on his tap dances [noise]\n\nArthur Duncan was key to kind of preserving this very much African American cultural tradition Laurence welk considered him part of the family the musical family so she sang with danced with white women\nIt was seen as completely normal this is back in the sixties and seventies when there's still a lot of discomfort with racial\nThe schools so in in a subtle way he's challenging this\nLong lost [noise] I don't blame you wrong [noise] thought to be\nIn this scene is basically a Thanksgiving dinner table\nWhere they're all sitting around and they start singing this beautiful song be thing for\n[noise]\n\nThe same time he [noise]\nThey're sitting at this table there's Arthur Duncan\nThe you know all the food is there [noise]\nYou have to spotlight coming down as if from heaven on the front of the table where where Jimmy Roberts is singing\nDegrading [noise]\nThe song be thankful was written by bourbon Taylor who was a Jewish New York\nThis song is a recognition that everything you have if you are a believer comes from God so you should be thankful that you are so blessed to have what you have\nOf course the implications for me are that you should reach out to help others [noise]\nOr is\nThis particular scene [noise] I think it's just so powerful because it it has this kind of utopian vision of family that is not based on its base on friendship and love and joy and it's not based on exclusion it's\nBased on the inclusion people from very diverse backgrounds\nWho will\nBe [noise]\nIn our contemporary world where\nEasily look down on us that it can be useful to appreciate the culture of rural America\nNow this doesn't mean that this is going to bridge political divides but it's at least something that we can use to work towards understanding the I mean I you know in my own family\n[noise] yes\n\nThat is one of them are performing ... it from your new album halo a widow dean shorts on a deterrent keyboard and okay locals in public on ... on drum yes\nUm it's kind of a family business your father a man he rest in peace he recently died yes Russia Molina a was a very well known a tank or a musician yeah in the country of tango what did he make of your music\nAt the beginning he he always thought it was a genius how genius you are I may just be so a self conscious about being a genius without any skills so and\nHe may just be too self conscious about what we did we didn't so we\nCouldn't just start with a very bad band and play anywhere because that was really bad we need to start an ... an irate and you get the failure rate and actually exactly so I I feel that I didn't have the time to learn from from the button\nAnd and then I became a ... a comedian I Know just to make my to to be able to pay my rent and on and pay my guitar lessons and that was that's what I read that and and\nAnd look up the videos of you being this big comedy star with your own show at age thirty one um in fact we have a clip of you from your big show or in the early nineties um why not just had a minor\nAnd in this up so you you're playing a panelist on a TV talk show who talks on and on without ever getting to a point\nAnd they know [laughter] [noise] but I cannot ... yet gone finances they have\nAccess\nSo acting and and comedy that that that began just as a day job to try to\nYes I I said okay I can do this and I have this character that I can impersonate 'cause I thought I mean I really want to make music but how can they afford to play musical\nThat has to pay but then I go\nI went well you're a star and that was when everything was kind of forgotten and meaning that I was caught in my own truck because I had found the solution to be able to have money to play music and then disillusioned became the main thing um\nAnd then when they realized that was happening I stopped everything we wouldn't yes had already been such\nA admirable a\nPresence of mind and fortitude to say no I'm giving that I'm giving up stardom up to go back to what they want to do that that's kind of extraordinary\nBut on this afternoon I had been wanting to do this since I was really little girl right on I thought I pictured myself in the future laying in bed being really old watching videos on MTV and being really hungry\nI could
