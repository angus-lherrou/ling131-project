response [laughter]\n[noise]\nI played the harrowing sixteen year old killer named as [noise]\n\nHer new documentary is kind of uh making of film but it's about that film that never got in it and that's because right after her movie rap twenty six years ago her director and mentor a mysterious guy named George car Dona\nJust disappeared along with every frame of film\nHer doc is called sugars same name as the original feature\nAnd earlier this year it won best directing award at the Sundance Film festival and it is now just rolling out on Netflix when Sandy Tong Kim into studio three sixty I asked her how she became such a movie obsessive as a kid and Singapore in the Nineteen eighties\nInto showing like river's edge or something when I was like fourteen and uh but you know I wound up staying in watching fleeting and Fellini eight and a half was was the thing kind of let me down another rabbit hole on and just boring enough then to allow me time to a daydream which is I think it's a really important for films slow you for you as a teenager\nSo so by the time you were born there you could buy tapes of film\nUm you could not it was very very difficult to look for movies so you have to go across the causeway to Malaysia to look for pirated movies and then I have a cousin in Florida\nAnd so I had her you know rent the movies I Want to see like a wild at heart and I'm blue velvet things like that and then she put them all on this one VHS but you know in those days you could take them at triple speeds so there's like three movies on one tape and when you watch them when they arrive at your house\nUm because they take that triple ... they're kind of fuzzy and you're watching them and they're they have this kind of music um religious quality to to them when you're watching them as a teenager like after it's been shipped to your house and you put it onto your VCR and watched it like a late at night and it's got this kind of I don't know it had its effect on me I get off movies that\n[noise] but you seem like I was gonna say one of the interesting things is describing these young teenage girls in Singapore being the what seemed like the coolest punky is geeks in town right\n[laughter] yeah the ... in retrospect\nI'm you know nobody was thinking we were so there we would completely isolated I was completely alone in my taste in my pursuits we had a small core friends um we're all into the same thing with and so you weren't glamorous no we were not glamorous I mean we seem like that that now because nobody else was doing that but back then we were like\nWhat's the secret to have a pretty figure it out\nJust got to find something you love to do and then do with your life [noise] me it's going to Russia [noise]\nThat's Jason towards minute Bill Murray in ah west Anderson's Rushmore for my two Ninety eight\nWhen I was watching the film I was like\nMy God this is what we were going for it and no one to tell I mean nobody but believe me I Would just sounds so grandiose and that was really frustrating for me and again when I saw a Ghost World that I felt the same thing with the same kind of ... of colors broadly offbeat\nHumor and and poker face humor [noise]\nYou know like the luckiest guy in the world\nHave stuff like this place and kill me\nOh come on what are you talking about\n... you think it's healthy obsessively collect things

your film up from a decade earlier\nCan read in the comedy sensibility\nOh yeah definitely I mean if it didn't have a sense of humor it wouldn't be fun right\nAnd there is a kind of a dead bands surrealism that I associate more with modern American in the nose\nYeah I like John ... um I think ... is a big influence on well like visually say\nAnd what I Want to pause if we can on ... who is who is there is a kind of number belly laugh about comic under his whole thing what particular uh movies of his did you love\n'em I think it was generally um maybe there was a bit of the um the look of a mystery train\nAnd then there was you know and um you know some of the colors but this movie is brimming with like bright colors in primary colors and\nWe were going for something David that was completely\nUh in opposition to stare out um you know just grey Singapore um St more responsibility in school and business and offices\nUm so there was a bit of John Waters as well on a lot of the American indie aesthetic we were going to we and and you know recently um a friend of mine was friends with Jay Root benefits I think I'm edits ... and he saw some of the footage in his jaw dropped because he thought\nIt was some collective unconscious you know some something that's going on where these kids in this this very distant part of the world were\nDoing something that kind of looked like they were trying for something that that people in America we're doing at the same rhino it\nIs like an alternate history that has been suppressed at least to me and to everybody about your

these directors in America at the turn of the century yeah yeah I mean it really feels like that right I mean as it doesn't really feel like like that and like you you you are this experiment that
