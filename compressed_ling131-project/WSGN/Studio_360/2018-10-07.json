it there are no fish and um it is I mean people it is a turtle fiction but it's not a comic no that's right that's right\nI mean I think the the sort of instinct for the book was um you know I teach at a college them and spend a lot of time trying to pay attention to what's happening in the world and there was a moment in or\nAround the time like Occupy Wall street in after where a lot of identity politics were just kinda roiling everyone and and I think that can be okay but some of the rhetoric started to feel\nScary is the right word but it made me a little itchy and I didn't know why but for the book I think I wanted to just ask the question what would be really intractable aspect of identity generational conflict and then what would it look like to just spend a couple of years trying to play that out in my head\nAnd talk about generation gaps to me at the time ... was the epitome of cheesy and dated and square which is exactly how Paul folks felt about the show was a kid\n... now teaches media in communication at New York university and the colleges Staten Island and for our future called guilty pleasures he talks about how his opinion shifted a hundred and eighty degrees [noise]\nAs a kid I remember my grandfather a cattle farmer in South eastern Iowa he was a very quiet man\nHas to turn would be that\nWould be the best word I remember\nProbably Saturday

it my guilty pleasure\nBut I don't feel about it actually I think it's cool the whole idea of\nCamp is your perspective more than the actual content so you can watch it as camp you can watch it in in this ironic fashion\nThat's something that I still enjoy it in this ironic fashion I find it hilarious still but I came to love it is more than something to laugh at\nOur very fine according to spy on the floor and all of the champagne music makers chime in with that all time favorite stumbling one\nFirst thing you notice about Lawrence Welk as he has this really strange\nEnglish wasn't his first language in Sherman was his first language and that's why he has this weird accent\nI felt a little bit of a kind of have a little water before it on the show\nHe carried the baton and he played the accordion\nHa ha ha ha ha\nThis\nIs what's so great about the show is there's this connection to people's immigrant\nDiversion America happened famously many fields government education entertainment and here's one Irish men who is pretty well known for his grade attend our boys of course I'm speaking of our own Joe feeding of course I\nPlay into whatever their immigrant past cliche so he's wearing a green suit and he's singing my Irish rose\n\nMan\nThere's this point where she holds the microphone for him to kind of get him to raise ...\n\nSo there's this great rapport between them [noise]\n\nAnd then at the end he says listen to the\nExtent that night that he would let a German player for an Irish men\nThere [noise] he's referring to himself as a German but\nOf course is a German American there's a recognition that America of course is the land of ... of immigrants this is something that has been often lost in our contemporary rural America I think\nThe gentleman I'm wearing the official jacket of the future farmers of America\nThis is a modern foreign and he's the Norwegian when Laurence welk refers to him\nThis is a national organization of some four hundred thousand high school boys on the farming areas of America\nAnd this was a group that every kid they grew up in a small town like my father my father was a member would belong to the expectation of course was that that you would become a farmer eventually as well [noise]\nYou know since the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies\nRural America has emptied out [noise]\nThe town that my father grew up in er my grandfather farmed it's a ghost town that's why there's a certain melancholy to this show and to the program [noise]\n\n[noise] oh one of the X. I remember on the Lawrence Welk show is the tap dancer or their Duncan was one of the first African Americans on broadcast\nTV [noise] [noise]\nSo here are through Duncan is tap dancing [noise]\n\nThe women are singing and looking on his tap dancers [noise]\n\nArthur Duncan was key to kind of preserving this very much\nThe family the musical family so she sang with danced with white women\nIt was seen as completely normal this was back in the sixties and seventies when\nThere's still a lot of discomfort with racial integration this was a time when I was going to school and there was a lot of protests about integrating the schools so in in a subtle way he's challenging this\nLong long time of year round [noise] if you do the [noise] the deadbeat moms and\nThis seems is basically a Thanksgiving dinner table\nWhere they're all sitting around and they started singing this beautiful song be thing for\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe line Andy\nThey're sitting at this table there's Arthur Duncan\nThe you know all the food is there [noise]\nYou have to spotlight coming down as if from heaven on the front of the table where where Jimmy Roberts is singing\n\nThe song be thankful was written by ... Taylor who was a Jewish New York\nThis song is a recognition that everything you have if you are a believer comes from God so you should be thankful that you are so blessed to have what you have\nOf course the implications for me are that you should reach out to help others\nOr is\nThis particular scene I think is just so powerful because it it has this kind of utopian vision of family that\nNot based on its base on friendship and love\nPeople from very diverse backgrounds\nWho know me will oh\nIs he\nIn our contemporary world where there\nIs this feeling among rural America that the coastal easily look down a U.S that it can be useful to appreciate the culture of rural America\nNow this doesn't mean that this is going to bridge political divide but it's at least something that we can use to work towards understanding I mean I you know my own family\nUm\n\nThat is one of them are performing ... from your new album halo a widow dean shorts on a deterrent keyboard and okay locals and public ... on Trump yes\nUm it's kind of a family business your father or many rest in peace he recently died yes Russia Molina a with a very well known a tank or a musician yeah in the country of

big show or in the early nineties um wanna manner\nAnd in this up so you you're playing a panelist on a TV talk show who talks on and on without ever getting to a point\nAnd they know [laughter] or they can and then after that ... that is the ...\nSo acting and and comedy that that that began just as a day job to try to\nI guess I I said okay I can do this I Know I have this character that I can impersonate because I thought I mean I really want to make music but how can they afford to play music all day long without having to work all day long how can I Do that and say gee\nThat's that has to pay but then I go out\nI said well you're a star and that was when everything was kind of forgotten and meaning that I was caught in my own truck because I had found the solution to be able to have money to play music and then the solution became the main thing\nAnd and then when I realized that was happening I stopped everything we were when yes had already been such\nA admirable a\nPresence of mind and fortitude to say no I'm giving that I'm giving that start 'em up to go back to what I Want to do that that's kind of extraordinary\nBut I just asked him I had been wanting to do this since I
