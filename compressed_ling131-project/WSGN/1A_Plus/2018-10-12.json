A. M. U. dot org before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want us to jump\nI just wanted to not to mention you know ... Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week uh talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there and that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money's at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business California's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order ...\nBut that's actually very close to that policy prescriptions the I. T. I. P. C. C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really and California is very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it at you know Paul Romer taxi about\n... the problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus on and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada at the same thing there yeah prime minister Justin Trudeau trainer and a\nAnd pose a a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my account dummy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point not my kind of me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLarry tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida that his he Faisal risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there\nYou just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town cannot incorporate uh it's it's it's a tough one\nReally tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about this trying to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national out\nIs it that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisors had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are and how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us\nOne a at W.

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories won a asked W. A. M. U. dot org cuts will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing the Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nIt seems to have had ... it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nAh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we all know and for weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state actually had\nA a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee uh maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that has had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college\nTrue control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships unlike unlike a shame said before they\nWill become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of the FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAbout the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up the church\n... I'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee where she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this says supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up there she's up for reelection you think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say is she just last night um was trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in Trump's side the White House just put forces three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt times to administration is really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these pack\nSo I Do want to see if we can leave time it's all California politics before the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just miss swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee but he woke him Tania was to the White House yesterday\nConnie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd would have loved to vote\nI Love this guy right\n\nNow Connie West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean that you see was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of set is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it\nBut it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre carnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA a when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make of it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching his head about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment then I Know for\nFor for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week she endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nAnd the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British ... has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand\nRegarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically sent hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government has really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened right well what we know right\nNow is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last time my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove Fletcher mark ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten and tortured killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or hurt it themselves but there's a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress and the White House or that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not at all being forthcoming about that this is a politically\nDifficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime and Saudi Arabia\nI'm Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince\n[noise] support for WB H M comes from our members and UAB collapsed school of business now welcoming students and visitors to its new home on university boulevard information at UAB dot edu slash business\nAnd Sheryl we've got just under a minute to go for twenty five contribution\nWeakens Gigi we can do this are members will do this are friends will do is they're going to step up I Know it [noise]\nWBAI Jim dot O.

A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\nJohn ... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically said hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point for shall\nWe know that he ... to into the come so uh in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure there are reports that there were two Gulf Stream jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men of new they go into a blackout of vines are drove to the ... so the consul general's residence which is allegedly ... show he may have been taken\nAnd they did what they did to him now there are reports circulating that\nAttack his intelligence have proof or that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered\nAnd a ... the most brutal brutal debts under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now\n... and then went back to re at who was on them ... that designation was within the state type of racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the ... are telling the authorities here\nAnd what your thirties here in the U.S to understand is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded and what the implications might be there are some things that you can easily sweep under the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... could I miss definitely falls into the category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies any press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to show use disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're lucky again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nBecause she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we're all like John we don't like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday in ... referring to evade human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms to hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia worry I Wonder if you could give us your sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read it earlier ... chest sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org [noise]\nThere was no reason to maintain close ties with the country that has more people than ISIS\nFinally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of the quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making law the sharp elbows\nPoint and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I Am so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have been arguing for a long time just as the commenter said I'm\nNow we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy the hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporters this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval\nSo no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns up alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead so I was gonna say people\nRand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the U. S. Trump ministries and had to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I wanted there is a counterpoint to this too which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of set the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because\nWe have never had a relationship an alliance faith and values since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not as a values based ally as in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it in a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what us presidents have said quietly for a long time yeah sure sure if I could chip in the Nazis\nIt's in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge arms deal that was about to be concluded\nAnd the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into Saudi Arabia or had been doing and whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nUm old ... and you know it was clear that the Saudis is said to ... you've got to call this the core off the dog's otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually\nControversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation and he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was too big a customer too important an ally\nAnd you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first place if he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however they they are they're on the un Donald Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead [noise]\nJust before we keep going and oh I was just going to\nSay if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace down as you recall last month at the un\nAnd the United states is pretty aggressive in calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course on Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he's still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of 'em to chew what's happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if in fact is the case that they have\nKilled a journalist inside their conflict who is it a resident of the United states\nOf journalists who have been killed there is another journalist\nBeing remembered today in Bulgaria at a funeral the body of thirty year old TV host Victoria Murray nova was found over the weekend near the Dan River in

still time to get\nThe story of the president of Interpol Ming hung way was reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week\nThe arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Meng the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened nephews have do we have the sense that\nYou know of why this is going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means that a larger sense well\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and there are arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the Shia government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taking as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um it could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife a ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalties said their suggestions certainly is that somehow he was less than loyal and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been ah she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use 'em up public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband then defend her husband that's something we don't normally see\nWas heading out to Brazil were far right presidential candidate John ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the ranks he nearly took the election with forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth\nWorry Freidman can you remind us who ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nHe's a fascinating character he's ... he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades um he is a law and order candidate that as his big thing so he says you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he's very controversial and saying you know the police\nThere is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of candidate to come back from that position\nUm I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both not a it's a he was stabbed in September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence round but his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting ready for this stopping that I had been so I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they say that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Mr use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report\nHas made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country could say it's not a big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact and something that needs to be dealt with aggressively and of course the kinds of changes that this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that ... demand sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nation's already seen\nAny either as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of wars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm ... ... it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of\nThat I think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly at it in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nJust sure I was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out and I on the main national news shows half an hour long so the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes with devoted to decide PCC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean there is one of the things that really strikes me about living here ... ... in America where you get more with uh I think the square inch than any other\nKind of country on the planet or you know cause huge amount about whether the climate is not discussed\nAnd that is one of the things that really strikes me whereas I think there's a much greater consciousness whether they're doing that much about it is another issue but I think that you know I Am struck by how a lift all this ... the national debate or compared to in other parts of the world\nAnd judge said one thing to that I spoke with the un secretary general Antonio ... recently right before the U.N General assembly and ask them what is the greatest threat do you face right now what does your greatest challenge I expect him to say
