Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with it must have missed a general secretary do my pronunciation may give you difficulty [noise]\nThe maximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nMuch you can answer this issue in the ...\nThe pattern every meeting [noise] from the meeting\nIn Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev or give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person\nOr when you think of ... a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um\nYou know when I was in government\nUh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't agree with the policies\nBut the decency of the man the humble and is the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with a Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this\nIs the winner probably sorry are probably some who city and openly quality and the president or they're hard to say\nThough their world disguised Joshua and uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country\nAnd his whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having terrorists\nIt's especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump but anyway the style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend and record back in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan had Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell recommend are extra wide I'll work on it I think very much a very good by\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made a bold decisions that won them loyal following they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and the revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common would seem to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership there is no one formula and no one checklist that defines all leaders\nStanley McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine to twenty ten and he's the co author of the new book leaders miss and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason men go and he joins us to discuss it General McChrystal welcome to one a\nIt's an honor busier Joshua we also like to take your questions and thoughts\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting comment on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W.

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nIf a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way\nHe made me feel better\nI think we want our leaders\nTo make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be that military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be\nAnd if we we frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say our wheat demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through the one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd the leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy 'cause I was there and how would therefore be to star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are but all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven dwarves so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nIt's very common I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece he wanted to\nIn a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York to co author of leaders miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is\nThe process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter will results\nMatter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comments she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes in the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself\nIn other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profiled weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others\nIt it it is something you don't see often it up Martin Luther king Junior's puppies success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his loss than I think it would have said something\nOn the other hand if you look at Margaret Thatcher she was a very successful female politician in Britain in a tough time for a female politician she became the most famous prime minister since Winston Churchill\n\nAnyone who works in the White House leaves with stories to tell Anthony Scaramucci has plenty of stories about President Trump's and about the people he says just don't get it\nFrom W.

from that\nAlso have had a a quaint and ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than\nI always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say what a threatened to run yet threatened to run yeah LA's either offer a president or are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the word for it and not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running\nAnd my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but uh you know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution among something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me on my love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt they were very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side in it we can my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you've said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda yeah no no no question\nI mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that\nNine page plan that basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press\nAnd servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN they had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so I find in the square ought to I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it\nWell I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous and Bannon out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nHe was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role which I Would have been happy to do is I'm a team player\nI don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have been New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for it and I know even be on the on that list\nBut as far as going to like me any more than he likes to present your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with that [noise]\nUm no actually ... you know ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on\nI'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... director is over a Tim in Iowa alone in the office I'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI Lived in a while you declare war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media first of all you're gonna lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well you way better served if we dial that down\nAnd the other thing is the president is a TV star or people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that stuff\nReal conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story and all we know that about the president so there was a lot of people inside the calm seems like okay we\nGot to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that were on an average ... maybe a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over look listen I just left a morning show where these guys like they\nThey rail on them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly that would probably refer your feathers because she would want accuracy and you would want\nAll that stuff to be dialed down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to so so but but we had to do that as you got to tell them straight is a man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way\nThere are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good ... let me get through a few more comments I Know we've only got you for a few more minutes but let me get\nSome more from our listeners Michelle is listening from Hudson New Hampshire\nMichele emailed as a fairly strong Democrat married to a

I'm I'm gonna agree with him I'm not gonna lie everything that you know even if I say something negative about the Wednesday I ain't got get alliance that you had the correct yes we had a ticket for

I Will say that\nYou know it it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents did share a small portion with my brother and I you know that means that my kids can literally choose any\nPrimary and secondary education gold I won't go to any school for any amount of time they can do anything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that sure drain\nDo it you know and that's an absolute blessing my husband

I worry about my parents someone hitting them over the head and making sure everyone stays home and\nI'm going to know I Know we got to move on and in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back
