A. M. U. dot board Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to Yemeni friends in ... and ... they are living in hell and they ask why does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nOf before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about\nThey are quite complex conflict a it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that the ... at the who the government in Sana'a that announced itself is actually in fact\nA coup government that is run by a militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen\nNow the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition\nThe aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and uh is struggling to go back to places where there is no who see I'm bullish on the ground\nAnd on top of that the who the militia innocence has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power was\nUh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven Yemen had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the ... and was present for some time\nBut I'm the sheer power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of ... ah for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend\nOn foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nBut I Do want to told me about the the population on the ground that needs help I just want to move before it gets were next wars and also didn't want to be clear there was a sectarian part of this these\nThese are the rebels ... kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslim sectarian aspect to this also lose so many versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen are don't practice the same sex\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as five or ... and it's really different from twelve or shall which is a the ... he formed that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles so many of them are in Indiana and we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in the sense that of course there are differences between these those two sects of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years now the CDs or the who the sect\nOf of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they did them as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize said the as them and to kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has them and the ...\nHas struggled to maintain ... as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as him coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost is a session\nAre rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground and human but I hear what you're saying some are in terms of all of these very complex fault lines moved kind of come together to fuel the civil war today now before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with least grounding shoes the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen\nLeast laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living and working beer here as part of our conversation that we have just a few minutes ago\nWe're going to be welcome to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger topics how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nNow in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year this is why the United nations is running the alarm bells\nAnd telling everyone that we're facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure was deprivation of be reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit name and there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the road work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in game and we've been able to contain the spread of how the Democrats have similar levels there's a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of course last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months\nOn supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely foot we are seeing for millions of people in this country they're immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people\nThat the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program from Chicago is Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what a mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now\nTo try and feed their child continue boils down to what an individual might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\n[noise] sixty percent of all of the people who live in this country are what we call food insecure now out of that out of those Eighteen million people every single morning there are eight and a half million who wake up and they have absolutely no idea where they are going to get food from that day\nSo what will happen is a family\nThen they'll go to their relatives and bake they'll go to religious institutions and bake\nThey'll come knocking on the doors of non governmental organizations in the UN\nAnd ask for help they'll go to Rob spins and pick out what they can\nSupport for NPR

email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of asked them if they were tracking with us\nAnd one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this secretary in aspects like several of us and we have a an array of of age ranges here students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sects within the sects I think that's where a lot of us kind of get lost can you can you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what set these people are with like why why does the sex\nSo when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned uh the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically has ADD and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the chef ... they're called ...\nNow the ... conflict\nA kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see is the political importation\nOf religious sects of what we're seeing it play is political Islam and that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the um [noise]\nKind of the guardian of ... and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the guardian of ... and so as soon as she our is pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrificed Yemen by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to kind of signed this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran I\nAnd at the same time also have this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense\nSo let me let me was I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said that I've been granted diagram everybody here ... years and watching you scribble in my piece of paper\nSo we've got these these two sets of Islam Sunni Islam and ... Islam is this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we're well on this kind of for political\nAnd regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face and Saudi Arabia has kind of noise that itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized use law has spread into other conflicts\nThese factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian ... for political reasons they are now aligning with each other gotcha\nGotcha ... he does that make more sense good sums up all around and if you go and I I appreciate you explain that I think\nYou know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some words you can't just\nBoil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us worn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth in but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you described the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n... telling her story is one of the reasons is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just ... and I think than we we deal with with a lot\nOf uh of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I ... I was in ... and which is a it probably been sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels\nAnd uh and it's mountainous in the in the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen there that the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition ward and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man tall\nDeathly thin rushed and with the with a tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of close Senate was hit eleven year old sister name was ...\nAnd for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too I think twenty four pounds was what it was about what we had to what we had asked at the doctors at that and it was\nAbsolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so a malnourished they also become so vulnerable to any kinds of ...\nAnd uh they get diarrhea they get devastatingly dehydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals until the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own end speaking with her family and\nHer mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family story and it is a story that reflects\nMillions of people's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school but whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stop to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped\nPeople would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanisms to you and I that's simply do I have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nThose coping strategies run out and they ran an ad for this family and they simply had no money and once a child starts to go downhill it can spiral out of control like this they were lucky family because they were able to afford to pay a cab to take them to the town\nAnd ... and lots of families are not that lucky and so one of the things that is really important to remember about this crisis is we don't even know how many children are dying for ... or we don't know how many don't make it to the hospitals\nAnd ... and you know this one child came from a middle class family that educated father and that's really terrifying benchmark of how deep and dangerous this problem is\n\nEqual access to education is the law but racial issues can get in the way let's see how one school near Chicago was trying to get things better and what's getting in the way\nFrom W.

U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary was made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow through various struggles with\nIts class with grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years has to a\n... had the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they are also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin ... Rebecca parish being Lou\n... Charles the story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really a cabin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry ... that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that are important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling and you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things\nAt that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more for your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period and the sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless and the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by doing either so full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his\nPark in the river forest high school Nathan rouse we were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary eaters that right see that's right\nWas that the more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmend the Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy\nAt the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to thank for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much for have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nProfessor stove or what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThe thing that struck me the hardest isn't episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the\nEnd the conversation that we do not have about schools\nThat have the illusion of integration and I said the losing of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today\nThat to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you [noise] you\nKnow one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that also struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nBut one of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nBy the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you're eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do that\nRuin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org 'cause that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org we're talking about racial\nEquity professor still vote what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people\nFeel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if\nWe had it right I mean I think this is and thank you for that question but I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it and I think is ... is the issue of concern\nGive me an example of getting people what they need when they need\nA young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people most often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... ... what\nDo you find or the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is at funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ...\nWell I'm going to talk about the parks in the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our book\nWas that when you really try to understand why changes so hard it really is\nEspecially in these kinds of communities\nAbout the folks who have a lot of resources that have been served while by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about this is a kind of form of opportunity hoarding\nBut it's a way China's had how race works today differently than it worked in the past in the past who might have said you can't be in my class or we're going to have separate schools all this kind of things today we had this veneer of racial integration and ...\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and

talking about in Atlanta tomorrow\nPoison it appears to be Russians preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow is targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voice mail\nEight five five to three six one a one a America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but what message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a I'd say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of Sergei ... Paul and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors Amanda Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax club how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were a bus in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to rent myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like\nAdvanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far\nThat we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make that to me I I\nMean it's not in a a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because\nCountry do not hard not to make denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdotal experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason there are other reasons is is that we've tried to\nTake you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not living in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of lay\nHer I say there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be one regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who is also a feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to like compared to any other students but the school has like I guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with extra curricula and so\nAnd who isn't in any extra curricular lose who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with and you do in the building they like it's hard but you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is when it gets versus sleeping bags whereas like\nAll all the white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have steaks and the school the\nParents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but\nOther than that right there was nothing really to kind of have to fend for yourself exactly ... that's just not the case you know I think it goes the showing 'em which episodes that we must have done it was like\nMost of the kids and his our news um tutoring sessions are usually white and are widely so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but that was just the one right to you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nKnow it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts to make take hits that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids don't hire attracts get more they get better they can better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take racial disparities that exist in all our society and and reproduce them in our schools and that this channel\nDeep racist history and tracking and general\nRace else becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational expect you know places in the same exact school I pronounce black\nShould have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including ... Williams the black or a future in the series\nLament the fact that it's a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning but just the it's a game it's in supporting game\nI mean in terms of a larger kind of a U.S an editor for vacation like having a more well read\nLearned ... some of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching in deep teaching was going on at lower levels which is not to excuse the system that man is talking about but we just we define being educated in such narrow ways it's about ACT scores\nAnd GPA's and that you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person as well but I hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse the sooner no I I hear that I I I hear that though I ... I Wonder though professor still while I think about you know kids who grow up in in refer parts of town that have been", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "24"}
