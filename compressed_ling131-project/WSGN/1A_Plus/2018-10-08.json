C.\nW. am used Patrick Madden was there on Saturday as hundreds of people protested on the Capitol Steps about a hundred sixty four people got arrested [noise]\nKind of reflects what we heard from ... in North Florida who tweeted [noise]\nVote like our lives depended on it in November and not let anything go to the Supreme\nYou know if his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed but he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media seeks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn wrote on our Facebook page you can't soft sell this anymore which unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the right didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John ... investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I did want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the evidence you a question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court or you know ... like ... set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed than others what did you make of\nThat [noise] so this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society um\nIs two completely different world views so when Democrats um well partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault us and take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and ah and to the president himself and so forth so that's their view on the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I ... I was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the Blasey Ford won was taken seriously was listen to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the\nLaugh test um the the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of rape gang going on in a in in ... as the Maryland in the Nineteen eighties and to the students and that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks have girls\nRamirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it\nSo um so so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with\nLazy Ford's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of of um\nMaking sleazy forwards case all the weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an ... ah may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues will\nThe president did also make some political have with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and is unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars are generous word what professor Ford said two Senate\nHow did he get home I don't remember how you get there and remember where is the point I don't remember how many I don't want to I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\n[noise] I'm Wondering why I don't know what I Want to feel that they are in [noise]\n\nAnd a man a man who lives just shattered\nPart of what the president said his rally last Wednesday\nIn Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remembered was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor was the fact that she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remember that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things the president did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and a driving ah people ah from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of um absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life\nWould think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life well and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that amount of early on I also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate over brown Brett Kavanaugh that seemed to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lotta mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving toward hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful that I Know I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a lousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged on Democrats sort of their their arguments\nA became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but then he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered in turn that a Democrat said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective on the the temperament question was an interesting one to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar that looking at the justice says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president to a point that it's based on the way they ruled\nSo the temperament question was\nInteresting I'm not sure how relevant is because we know all the politics of all the justices\nNot really sure how cabinets temperament plays into it\nWith regards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the Thomas and Kavanaugh hearings referring to Clarence Thomas\nFifty fifty plus one there's no need for civility for the majority anymore because there's no need to have at least some support from both sides you know is what do you make a simple comments\nDid not require sixty votes confirmed but\nIf you did not ... not that we\nNever required sixty votes to confirm um he may have required sixty votes to proceed to the vote ...

could go\nA little early on I mentioned that that Republicans might suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen that's a dangerous business that you\nAre but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiasts on there's had twelve point\nUp words swaying among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about ... their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that and know what I mentioned right the idea that ... without any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women\nVery visceral for quite a lot of few including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time than the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of a time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel is talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boil ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nAh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd I'm the only one I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in three and one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a yet\nOr not race that that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against their will so writer should be careful with a number yeah go ahead go okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male\nSexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also you have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nLike well this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show was a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said\nI don't want to hear it we've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal\nYou were yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do I hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier and I I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\n[noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the Kavanaugh confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised and it was should he get\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should ah had the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and not seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that uh there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation in saying that\nUh men should base a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court by should know that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of a reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nMy name is far I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed\nJak and our congressman and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this time being the African American woman I really do feel that it was all up the joke that they went behind doors and said okay let's get the country a good show\nThey already know what they were going to do it's not a government by the people\nOn Oh yes it is only up to a large group of people\nPre shirts calling and sharing your thoughts with us and we get to a few more comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed I'm so sick and tired of people\nSwitched white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court her life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined the me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll have another really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some sushi will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate ... gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with presidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nI'm because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some art claiming\nI'm I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester as I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\nUm I Do think that Susan Collins overstated a Kavanaugh's moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was as a judge and they ... he was following Supreme Court\nPrecedent his job as a judge was try to guess how the Supreme Court would rule on a particular issue given the process that now that he is setting that President he's played a role in what he thinks that President should be\nThe discussion is civil it's respectful that's while you listen and that's why you

A. M. U. dot org Katie you're on the ...\nFirst I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you would just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending ill senses of the census really starts\nThe whole process or the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThere is a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the hunting can heal method so California gets the fifty first date and if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does\nThe seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways\nOr some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power or other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and in the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate or in crazy ways in ways that where the the communities are divided a diminished\nUh every state has gone through its own hiccups with political gerrymandering\nA it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see from around a lot of in this next redistricting yeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David you're in Charlotte\nFollowing the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing the district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrat's who Washington a Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state in the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nMore votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override the actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um ended also discourages competition in a lot of the states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen\nCompetitors so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks took a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as taught us topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district\nAnd an ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot org\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you are trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that too many sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really are being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders on with these messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\nI realized that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about gerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't heard or that popular a proposals aren't being passed at the local level\nAnd we're lucky and Michigan where we have the citizen lead ballot initiative process which means if we can write constitutional language as the people of Michigan and then gather on this list\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from loved me in makers have go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform allowing people to connect around the globe to get work done learn

made you feel like you had to be perfect show no fear never screw up and avoid asking for help not the easiest working conditions but what else is there\nResearch or ... brown argues that the same

safe to be yourself\nYour whole self\nUs a voice mail eight five five\nTo three six one a one day how much are you able to be yourself at work does your company feel like a safe place to just be human

keep up to date on future topics we will share some of your stories when Bernie brown joins us in Studio tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Katie ... he's a founder and executive director of voters not politicians David daily senior fellow at fair vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent\nFor the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election\nMark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously just Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world\nHe sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com this is they say\nGerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about the role of Republicans\nIn gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current map this gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know well the Virginia example he's talking about\nThe house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this uh\nGerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist today\nA isn't to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper ... in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander some ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talk about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters are and now even today\nOne district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes\nBoth parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the lines aren't fair and therefore are are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these winds may not be fair right but the the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the GOP is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to read history by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and say so publicly\n... he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had with folks are that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel\nPractically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan that we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drying process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all look to government ... at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know there is also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republican\nIs that we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we are a lot of people talking about even if they're the of fish all that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least trans parents states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing those town hall says a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn and then eight years later some emails coming coming out a talking directly about how these lines were drawn to guarantee one party in advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests um\nWhat's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work I'm happy that Thanksgiving dinner or your family yeah yeah my mom gathered five hundred signatures and is canvassing every day we got thirty days till the election so\nIt's been really exciting I mean you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree\nOn but I really like working on this issue because\nThe basic concepts of fairness and an impartial system and a system that puts the people first I think those are some of our core democratic values that when you think about America", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "08"}
