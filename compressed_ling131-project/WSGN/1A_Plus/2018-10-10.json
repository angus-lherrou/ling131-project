K through Michael\nBut um [noise] we can't say that the American\nOr directly related to global warming but we can say is the charm says that these ... increasing as a result of global warming because all my atmosphere had more energy can\nHold more Walter ... says the charm says that they saw that extreme it that sweaters harkens or extreme rainfall or heat waves are increasing with three little bits are wanting\nMe to a few more of your comments Sarah emailed I feel overwhelmed by the talk about climate change\nAnd don't feel like there is a unified voice out they're letting families knew what concrete steps they can take to make a difference for our family this has led to ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options in just a moment but let me get to a few more\nThoughts that have come in the U.S far ... emailed\nYou should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them find half the voters in the U.S read Donald Trump's tweet that global warming was a Chinese hoax and voted for him anyway that just goes to show how important the issue as to the people in this country\nCall Devon port I Wonder if you could respond to Joel's email I mean the president has committed to taking us out of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement by saying well who wrote it up let me see who wrote a now believe it does Joel have a point\nOut well in in terms of um ... policies being at the policies that address climate change on the U.S really isn't a\nA distinctive place right now I think I'm Around the rest of the world we do see an expression of well by leaders to um enact policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions I think that there's a lot of questions on how strong less policies actually are um\nInitial two degrees but the in the U. S.\nUm what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic established of of\nClimate change but but also moving to undo existing climate policies I'm President Trump has already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants on undo or weekend\nUm regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars um and he had said that it is his objective to promote the use of coal\nI'm burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions\nA President Trump wants to promote the use of calling us and abroad um one of the findings of this report is\nThat in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to um\nYou know to to to the sort of at least destructive\nUm level of warming\nUm the use of coal will have to ah basically go down to zero I'm by by twenty fifty so ... basically\nNo more on just about no more coal and and and and it is you know that that is that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um they go in that direction\nAnd in that let me just once I started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this I hear you on I I totally hear you on how disruptive versus white polish so interwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just yank it all out\nI Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who\nWe we know that there are voices who were saying well poll it'd be really hard to pull out to get the sense of there's anyone in the world stage saying tough our planet is only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal with on you or California so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nYeah and many of the ... on on the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use coal um so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leaders saying you know this is what what needs to\nThe world's largest um greenhouse gas polluter and is now said user of coal at the same time we're ... the Chinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon ah they're they're they're an acting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay attacks or the um in in order to ... which is designed to drive the market away from from greenhouse gas has an idea that was invented in the United states but as\nI'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with that Congress voting against at Iraq and in the United states\nAnd I do want us to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments Brian emailed we have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we\nWill keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low would be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world who\nYou believe are sincere in their pushed to do something significant about climate change is there anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you were active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency that's doing something tangible\nThat you feel people should know more about we'd love to hear from you what gives you hope that climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W.

by the Democratic party that immediately convinced me that the manmade weather change is nothing but a political hoax to fool the stupid\nProfessor liver and what would you say to tell them\nWell I grew up in a country Britain where it's not political and to set aside my life I Lived in a country with politicians\nIt's like a woman was happening so when I moved to the U.S I guess it was I'm a little surprising to find how pasta and this basic scientific problem is um and\nWe have to find some way to get other than that I think and that's one of the things they are the CDC reports tried to do we don't try to tell people what to do we tried to put together all of the scientific information so that policymakers can make their decision I did want to add to intense or other regions that are

you are trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change here is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake and Jeff in Michigan listen\nI'm getting a thought to slash ... thought slash feeling powerless and that I Can't do enough to stop that the path of destruction that Iran\nI pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening to the world is happening at a corporate level and I'm Still\nMore companies get on board and care about the environment it feels like we're kind of on the inevitable path um two thousand four to you will be here before we know it and we will rip the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want\nTo a [noise] good to be with you Joshua what is the climate leadership council\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a white actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution is pushing for a carbon tax where all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the ah oil majors the largest car manufacturer\nAnd it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers\nAnd of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker shields carbon demands plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that as a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon\nOkay and they just connected to the organization or use it as a spin off but it's still a connection in any way or completely separate uh\nIt is a separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by\nFormer Republican Senate majority leader Trent law and a a sooner bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power\nInterests cold report let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council was advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for us what exactly is a carbon tax\nSo um [noise] the idea of a carbon tax is um and each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nUm and ah in in in ... and important note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house\nHe's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday or the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of\nEvery kind of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much\nEach kind of carbon hurts a the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time um you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost that once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are ... ... can essentially um create attacks\nOh it's upon polluters of carbon dioxide no no\nNo carbon but what I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I just want to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car Baker do I pay the what we're talking about the pollution from automobiles does the carmaker\nPay carbon tax for producing the vehicle that belching out carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas alone to turn ...\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm okay\nAnd and and and ... so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um\nYou know an intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is um if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning\n'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in and then mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it\nThat would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would drive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars not because not out of some sort of\nUm moral sensibility but because actually up at a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobbying Congress for a price on carbon give us a sense of what the plant involves and why it's getting support now\n[noise] so um the bigger shields carbon defense plant is based on four pillars of the first is a robust carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any a leading emitting country\nAll of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend which means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan and a third pillar is that we would\nTrade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effect\nDo affect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend is that what you called\n[noise] yes so a family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy would all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan a popular\nAnd politically viable because in cap on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well\nLet's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well let's spend it on a renewable energy innovation or a low income support\nIt opens up Pandora's box by contrast when you returned all the money directly to the American people it closes that box and what polling shows is that it's overwhelmingly popular most interesting\nThere's three to one support among Republican voters and Trump supporters for this plan for to one support among millennials which of course or soon to be the largest voting cohort\nI hear you in terms of the political viability I think it's interesting that your organization is put together something that can actually pass or at least in your view could actually pass and seems to show support on on both sides I Wonder if you believe that it would actually for lack of a better word worse\nToday tomorrow to gather\nThank you for your contribution we have support from so many individuals who choose to become members of WBAI chance we thank you all\nWe also have businesses and corporations in organizations around the heart of Alabama who support the station as well one of them is leaving he's fine jewelry on Second Avenue north specializing in antique and estate jewelry and loose diamonds since Nineteen twenty two\nInformation at two five\nOne three three eight one\nWill have a second hour of one a coming up after NPR News headlines at ten oh one hope you'll stay with us and again if you've not yet made your donation for this go round to WBAI gym or if you want to become a new member a make a sustaining pledge please do so WBAI Jim dot\nO.

it\nAnd for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nMade you flash back to er sad about for a lay\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or for people and you often hear you know you need to be thinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this\nIt was kind of all of us will have that moment that we can personalize it whether it's your interview or what have you and I think that was a part of it\nHas her what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name's needs to take me as I Am\nShe worked at it you know got them to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and then I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about our nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive in Hollywood as far as coming on the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that because\nAlmost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's\nReally no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming and playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to so it's almost like we own fashion and its view of the music industry\nBut only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle\nA the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen the stars born will not be seeing stars ... just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper is character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah\nThose petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view the commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho is very much an invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical filed style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with a view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways\nIs very linear it's a very linear idea of there is one um road to fame there is one pass you just simply ascend or D sand as opposed to there's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like\nThat he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional Paso agree with Anna about that but I think that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other\nOn this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper without a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nExcept for the voice in rocket and guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean she is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of the story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and broadly similar\nWhen they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character alley is just improvising the love so\nMany people\nTime to time can\nTo [noise]\n\nWho's really didn't know [noise]\nPretty good Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's alive we said we sing everything live in the movie wow you there's nothing we're not just lives thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene is actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he was a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do Kevin Cavanaugh KCUR\nAnd I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism\nAnd stayed with him it would be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty\nAnd I think as his alcoholism be becomes worse he continues to treat her worse and yes he's Bradley Cooper and yes he's is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully what alley saw in him\nFor college and we can't wait to talk to ya eight hundred for for for nine two four six\nAnd thanks support for NPR comes from the

you hear me yes I have a five stars which why five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um\nI thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink\nAnd their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent I guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over\nThe manager do agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but ah the minute he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him\nOf being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent and I think I heard you chime in as well\nNo that was a male nominee go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager is I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who was aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced elements that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these um recovery processes\nAnd an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but\nYou know did the movie really deal with the job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough to drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or are we are done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example he goes on states to rehearse with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right now if that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nLet's all go ahead and go ahead\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine at the same monster is like the guy got what's called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS going to have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost was a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a\nA stand in for the machine be part of the part of the cast you know has to be there um I also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem\nInitially aimed at women we feel very sympathetic or ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that\nEven as Jackson, Maine is saves temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he has destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery\nFeminist raining problematic found well\nBut you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a failing male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative ... nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made means characters advising her work well\nI'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance his scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story\nThe performances especially the musical once more fantastic and the cinematography was incredible I expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography the cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been out score original song\nAnd editing John horns spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here\nIs a part of that conversation from K. P. C. sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot him between two sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater were ... in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "10"}
