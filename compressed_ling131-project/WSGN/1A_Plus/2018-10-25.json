A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes\nAnd the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire the value that at all over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us a sense Susanna how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seems\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings were you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich after the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich is engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorneys I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them the scratch retained annuity trust which is the formal\nYeah there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinda things aren't\nA gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people that Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get one more comment that were sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who ... who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and her father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far all I hear is that he use certain mechanisms to avoid paying taxes as\nWe all do we all take adoptions standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with Suzanne what would you say to Jeff\n\nThe top I mean these aren't standard deduction so one one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the rust mentioned\nUm was a company that was set up it's it's interesting 'cause it's true that the rich ... to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ...\nHe had a lot of cash 'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Fred Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent of state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on and we're talking\nTens and tens of millions of dollars so what they did was for years Fred Trump he would go out and he would buy supplies for his buildings you know we're talking boilers pay every new boilers paint supplies for just does all those sort of things and then one day\nSupport for NPR comments from this station and from ...\nThe graduate and

York times still time to get in a few more of your questions and comments won a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this it\nTheir job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout the story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to\nAnd and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality of the er the toxin out against that we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did\nUm you understand when when the IRS does see something I'm their stock and force I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement and we we saw that additional tax in certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled and and and things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm I owe county as the company where they had they were putting the invoices in order to drain\nUm fried Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it's sort of a um a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS do they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations\nOn any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities who say based on ah\nThe the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supplying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said ...\nUm ... it's a good question the estate tax if they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some taxes\nPresident we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be ... potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not pay tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips at one of Donald Trump's fails casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in its darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full force of the law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential\nAnd various taxing authorities I'm another authorities could be looking at um\nWhere the food they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n[noise] ... ...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute it the the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with the state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none\nSudan and they're\nInteresting comments that had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has has stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House\nAnd he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made billionaire um there is no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire but what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune in where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um say he didn't get revenue or money from other areas you know there's been stories that some of it has come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father\n[noise]\nOf terror people coast to coast including to living presidents targeted with suspicious packages where does the investigation stand and who did

people find extraordinary and you know\nIn in both senses of that would that it's an extraordinary provocative thing but some people\nI think to have trouble believing the British Government narrative its details\nI have to say though you know as time has gone on and particularly things we've seen in the last month now with the identification of two suspects and then Russian Janice and experts working to find out the real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on season and and then to link them to this ministry intelligence\nAnd let's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what does it do\nWell at the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct shuts off\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the bully that sing some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the same in a lot of countries that historically or the general stuff will have its own intelligence department and that's been the case in changing one or two

A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one at a or comments on our Facebook page regarding the poisoning Martin asks there were five people substantially exposed to the nerve agent in Salisbury one of whom died what's the condition of the others\nMark [noise] um well ah\nSo those on the people on Nick Bailey who was a police officer who went to this ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but still not ready to return to work [noise]\nUh of course a Charlie Rowley who was one of those\nWho are then found the ...\nAh in the summer in June and uh he's ... because the person who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts\nAnd then of course you get to UT a script pile and ... and uh\nShe was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can infer from that but uh how to a lesser dosage and ah so I suppose you could say the most serious they affected person who survived will ... himself\nThat don't just even jokes they were saying well\nAh we think that will be long term side effects ... it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... himself as presidents have come with essence that's my understanding or they're all some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss the specifics that are both because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there are still call it ...\nWith regard to Yulia ... daughter and I emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London considering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order mark\nI'm well I I'll just pick colds in one little bits of Anna's a description that the the two people the two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe how they arrived the previous day at a different London apple got wake\nA she arrived then on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um let's just talk about uh that's just a detail um look there is definitely something of interest about a half\nArrival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\nI'm ... and right from the outset people I was speaking to who were involved in in trying to work out what has happened investigated a believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the uh suspects are named as ... had been in the u._k. on exactly the same period the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team or a big problem twenty Seventeen and then another man who's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so\nIn and at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen\nNow this raises questions about or would they ... for some time whether they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they could hack a email account and that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty Thirteen home woods and indeed him my ball fine [noise]\nUm she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because her brother slash a how to use both stay on the focus too much [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a lake twenty Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically a Sasha by the way had died but it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with her dad at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were normally together as a family [noise]\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the\nTiming of the attack was critically linked to use his arrival ah hacking her data by females and stuff which said sure I'll come up from the apple et cetera et cetera et cetera would help them to locate a gay make sure he was not a business trip or in some other way absent [noise]\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm Yulia had boats and he is a bit of a cab yet he is salt by some two of has connections with\nA one of the Russian intelligence agency thought he was not on the scene for example back in twenty sixteen\nWhen it's believed that is a figure of using the name so if it does have traveled to the u._k.\nHe was not on the scene back in ... when we know according to the u._k. government\nThat her email account was hacked or he hadn't been on the scene for much more than a year so [noise]\nYou know we don't know and [laughter] you know fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some pause in if I'm about ... we know that after the attack um [noise]\nUh well nearly among softer there was a court hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was stated in ... that he had not been in touch with the hospital for example to find out how she was\nSo the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance or you just had access to the Internet since uh\nIf they often ... by a social media or messaging ... or email or whatever or buts we have to assume that they no longer

that he it'll kind of lost faith\nAs it were in the G are you do have a sense of whether there was a last straw for ...\nUm yeah that's a good question um\nThe way he describes it and it was a gradual process so when he was in middle to which is Nineteen Ninety four to eighty nine he says he was walking home he was recruiting souls his he was really playing the game\nBut he also says that he began to have downs\nA and began to question the audio logical conditioning he'd been given you know to view members of the CIA or am I say so west and minute tree as enemies and to view them in what the um
