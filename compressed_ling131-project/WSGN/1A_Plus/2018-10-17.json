[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson in Washington what her Native American voters thinking about for the midterms\nMuch more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry the senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI get why some people think there's hated being made here\nYou won't find my family members on any roles in I'm not enrolled in a tried\nAnd I want to make something clear I respect that distinction I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes\nMy mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things does it matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage\nClearly does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry that apparently led to senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we are now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a Cherokee citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA uh you're really undermines tribal interest frankly on top of that\nThe bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth\nFar less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her quote DNA test is useless even they don't want her phoney and quote\nWhat is this story actually mean for Native Americans right now\nAnd what else matters to these voters that the rest of America should know about joining us via Skype from Anchorage, Alaska is mark ... the editor of Indian country today he's also a citizen of the show any Bennett nation mark welcome to the program\nThank you delighted to be here\nHere with us in Studio is Carrie levine a senior reporter for the center for Public Integrity Kerry welcome back thank you and joining us from NPR West near Los Angeles is Simon ... Smith a Chicano writer and reporter and the CNN contributor he's also an ... citizens Simon glad to have you with us\nFor having me we welcome your questions and thoughts about this or any other issues that you feel are relevant to Native American voters in the midterms so email us one a at W. A. M. U. dot org comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a and of course we should be clear there are certain issues that cut across\nBeen a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing Carol thanks very much for getting in touch with us mark ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is\nFor becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is shown is was hunted bastard on\nHunted mastodon\nHunted messed it I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledged member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it is incumbent upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native [noise] you know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money they make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smog in title ...\nOur word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say find not your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth\nOf last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nNamed Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about would be and they can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you are going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nYou ate progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you were in progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the court until now last\nWeek the Supreme Court decided to essentially and let it go into effect for the November election\nSo what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election as you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who is one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer\nHer Republican challenger polls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had\nA very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed at\nThat were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from you if you're in North Dakota but email is one a X. W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one a or comment on our Facebook page\nJerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them is this on people's radar as this kind of more of a a smaller issue\nI'd say it is and also you have to put it against the larger contact\nOr you'd see it as it is a big issue ...\nI think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nI'm a you know it's really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the states\nGetting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their excuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits that are taking steps\nTo try and help people get residential address as if they need them assigned trying to make sure that they can obtain id and looking to mobilize voters and find ways to get them to the polls whether those efforts will be successful given the short timeframe I I don't think that's clear yet but I think you absolutely have a reaction to that is\nRight now\nFeaturing the all new three row ascent with eating for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs\nLove it so it makes us Subaru Subaru learn more at Subaru dot com\nFrom fidelity investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more it fidelity dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services El Al ... and from Americans for the arts\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with a national look at major races and issues we booked a great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one day which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national\nLevel it's eight five five to three six one two one two you can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.

I I have no context for dealing with tribal populations in politics and you said there is quite an array of diversity among the tribes that would that you'd be representing\nIn Congress can you give folks just a sense of what it's like to try to represent the issues of all those different groups do you find that there is a handful of issues the kind of overlap every one or do you really have to be sensitive to what this tribe is asking for versus whether that tribe is asking for and and we are the differences are\nSure I mean I think there are some of that ... ... absolutely\nHum land water uh our environment is all I mean that's sort of a ... those are issues that transcend\nUm you know tribal lines so to speak to issues that that all of us are concerned about and so um so I I'm I'm a lifelong environmentalist and you know I I'm a I'm somebody who used to go down to the\nTo the field with my grandfather and weeds and pick worms off of corn\nUm so I Know I understand the value of clean water and clean land to our people and I think that is that's an issue that\nTranscends a lot of tribes across the country um but you know the issues you were talking about earlier with voting that that is that's definitely an issue that all of us care about as well because we deserve\nA to have a voice at the table that's something I've been fighting for for a long time I've I've been getting out the vote in Indian communities for nearly Twenty years because I've always felt that we should have a say in who are elected officials are so\nUm so that's a passion of mine as well and and I want to work to make sure that that our voices are always heard in that respect\nI don't want to keep you too much longer but I Do wonder what you make of this larger surge of Native American candidates this year ... ... what do you think is behind that\nWell of course I mean it's a you know it's hard to say exactly but I mean there we can because we've had you know we've had a advocates and and you know we've had protest for centuries there I mean we we've always been on the ground\nFighting for I'm fighting for something that we feel we deserve and and that's been true whether it's fishing rights water rights land rights\nUm those have always you know been hallmarks of our of of protests throughout throughout our country's history for Native Americans\nUm but it but we hear it pledge drive after pledge drive a from folks who have listened for years and I've decided I'm now's the time I Can't do it anymore I've been listening forever and never once given\nDon't be that person be the person who does something good for your self uh by getting to a news organization that that you can trust 'em and that you that you rely on day in and day out eight hundred for for for nine two four six or W.

A. M. U. dot org let's read one more eggs or from\nThe book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland and it is on page eighty one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down page any one of the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that first police\nA sure\nAnyway and offer ... when we were asked of okay\nWhen we were half a mile from home in Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat kept both ... both hands on women look straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and suck more red black and green African medallion it into my public enemy T shirt you told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer now down and lifting your window when I saw your face or close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted a superpower to melt every gun in the world and the black grits\nOfficer asked why we had in Mississippi license place because\nPark has done anything wrong officer when officer told you to speak up and claim you changed lanes without signaling you kept your grip\nOn the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signaled and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face as he asked for your license and registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came off just staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may I have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions golf to ask both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said louder this time we have done nothing wrong\nMy fist were bald up and I was edging towards the driver's side window you slapped me across much that's what the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious office right as another officer pulled up the first officer who now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nYou eventually showed a second officer your license and your University of Maryland id\nOfficer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you set it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself I hear you I told you and try to make you laugh\nWhy didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said\nOh you wouldn't I told you that fool got matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nThe right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky and the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threatening us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style\nOf flying I loved our style of flying\nOther eggs or for heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crust of a lot of ah the relationship to talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school and eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning\nWhen we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put the knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned at some times and often a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not and giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble\nLater I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out\nAnd that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking this section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom issue we're trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her ...\nIs that we're right some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more [noise]\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about why people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about was like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that finding that protection she saw me and relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself where I was mistreated people emotionally\nWe didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside in the house\nThe particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it and so you know it took me until I was like forty to forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house I Want to talk\nMore about your literary style but I didn't want to point out one other aspect of the anecdote you just read\nWhere the officer looked at you and said who is that is that your man there's also this through line about people presuming that black boys are older than they are it was a factor in the shooting of to me a rice the young man who was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio back in November of twenty fourteen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "17"}
