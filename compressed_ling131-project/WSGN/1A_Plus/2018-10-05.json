{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WSGN", "content": "We've got continuing live special coverage from NPR regarding the built this morning on the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh it's nine o'clock\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court if he clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those and just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nKey votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to win\nKey thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not necessarily not not necessarily yes over the weekend could vinyl say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy\nAnd it sounds like if there is for key votes this has got to be close they're going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most ah let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're gonna try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entire already over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's\nFirst nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final cleanup hit for their side\nAt but don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo independent investigation\nOf the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel\nTo put a witness Dr Ford on trial only at the eleventh hour urging a break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a\nOne week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely circumstance cry\nBy the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago\nOne week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward\nWhen it comes to complaining about delay\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nGarland\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign\nOr the politics of personal destruction with this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience there\nAnd our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr\nFord and her deeply held memories of what happened to all\nOf a smear campaign are they using doctor forward if a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee\nFrom the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter has the shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America\nPeople who will stop at nothing to entrench in advantage on our nation's courts\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nBe recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nAnd for what for whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh certainly a product of an elite education\nBut also someone with hard right conservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans believe why most Democrats oppose this nomination at the outset\nFeels like ancient history now but let us not forget that most importantly\nNot any more not after\nAll this the United States Senate will also be making a say within the states\nThat partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEveryone is innocent until proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside one politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping\nThe center the mob can attack and the Senate case\nAlthough sign up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on Americans live\nOr will declare that our society cannot and must not will not set the bar so low\n\nSo I'm at I'm president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well\nThe ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long\nOr on fooled us\nAmerican people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice judge Kavanaugh was now says the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would pave the way to turn it\nHis audience\nCrowds of far allowed protesters still filling out in the blanks on their pick inside there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy met\nAnd I'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nApparently you get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nThat was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meanings\nApply\nUntil of course one number of judge Kavanaugh's last night I said I'm ... earlier this week\nSo stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity the absurdity the indebtedness it this\nIs our approach to confirming a Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct and resist and before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nColleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation mere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary it was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nResistance until the final vote was called for a few weeks there are fringe played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat there were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... ... women\nHospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old trucks so I'm old playbook but here was the problem\nThey all players weren't working\nThe distortions were being literate drowned out by the facts\nSenators received an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus a pen which\nAre sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge\nThere's nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was clear modern president they owe taxes weren't working\nBut I'm going to get the job done the resistance demand more try something new they said\nWell we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr forward and coughing up to the Democratic side of the judiciary committee's\nSomehow\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for truth the community collected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh\nSeventh\nFBI investigation\nBy an embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence not not\nWas producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiry\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWell not wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yeah again\nI Believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty or all allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nThe latest story as it the whole investigation is invalid because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand\nAbout nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses never mind that they didn't actually witness\nSo let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say they'll say first heard thirty five years after the suppose fact what nonsense\nOften this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things Senate do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation that would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast for the addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime really\nOf campaigning for a change the federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as they go through the roll your kill\nIs Mr Toomey Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow\nRacine that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture\nOkay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is ... is is flew it entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a sperm sense now the final vote goes until they bang the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nTelegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ... and Chris Coons of Delaware has got to Delaware\nBut I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new\nHe said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and there really is it ... in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he ... the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with that asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nRight Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor\nA cabinet along with Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nAnd he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate that test vote in a sense and just to remind people or maybe joining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be a coming on Saturday you\nAre listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex ... has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nA Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and\nYou know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the mid term is the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been an do jazz them\nGap as a lot of the service has shown and as NPR's surveys show earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we are uh months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was the challenge for us going into the metro it's why the out of\nPower party normally does very well and\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been\nThe Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of the nail on the coughing in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there was probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined\nTo have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from\nA Republican perspective we wanted we want to have a a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely while the character assassination continues and then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor\nWhich is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee and others solid\nA judge on the Supreme Court that is a great deliverable for for our base just like tax reform lesser good deliverable for our base I think we're you're if you're a Republican voter who has mixed feelings about Trump's personality as frankly I Do you look at these results over the last two years between tax reform but we're done with judges\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate and the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and a West Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah ah choose a choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the notion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is\nSenators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well\nGood morning to get both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as we got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme\nCourt to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick\nFrom his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance sports sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four\nI think you can expect the conservatives to win\nAnd they may\nMove on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on legal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue the conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nA good heart even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding presidents so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether\nAnd then for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration said to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class\nAction suit in court challenge that ...\nThat example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights\nAnd and and many other things\nLet's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a\nSo that a minority cannot block a action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes\nOne of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to rip out to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nVoting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride Ron Elving\nIs but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would you do that\nWell the the justification that people put forward as they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't\nAnd at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor she has not said that let's be no she didn't live in and out\nAs that option she may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's on her and she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules were different when that sort of thing would happen you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe only fifty two votes to pass and now you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote\nAnd win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote\nAnd then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about the nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the factory verdict\nOf the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail but\nThe uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate will have the files or\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer today with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now more lately is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ...\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learned this news of the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the um [noise]\nUh she was in college a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know\nShe might be actually trying to uh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know he deserves a vote I'm going to vote no but he just starts about that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe mansion who I think Democrats are probably\nUm but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now [noise] ah if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or\nReinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we're deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one or plausibly although it's a long shot in both\nHouses of Congress could flip and we have mentioned in our live coverage here\nThat there are about ten Democratic senators who were seen as vulnerable representing states that voted for President Trump and now up for reelection\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we had been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage then they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance denomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock\nAs to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nBut the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote\nFor a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault and then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is the vote\nThen the segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to your ear to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate to beat the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allow much Alaska well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's a very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't all Republican leadership anything\nSo when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profile in courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nOr because of the politics of either their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe ... and when\nWe say profile in courage we're defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody has to stay well at that time on that and how to fix would suggest that not as a Democrat that pro democratic same I mean that as somebody who would ... going on in their voting rights go against their base so\nWhen you think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with\nThe pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and there wouldn't be an out I'd still be fifty votes would be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake in an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday I must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n[noise]\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of the kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't it a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter is to pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick\nGarland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell said Mitch McConnell said\nWe're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never ... an island and and and Obama had thought he was doing a\nI'm a a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick that she picked a moderate he picked a moderate liberal\nUh of ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit every\nWe can hold month at that that you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nA Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listened to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also got it on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick as your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen\nIran answers that I've just had which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and ... and so now that the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what are beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong yes there are some\nSimilarities here and for Republicans the years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan did this Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time that had just one of the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they had lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning in the south\nWith black voters they were winning with African American votes\nAnd Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case that those southern Democrats really owed those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who was willing to quite freely admit\nHe had highly conservative views remarkably eye opening eye popping views on some of the oldest Supreme Court precedents\nAnd the Democrats were appalled in the hearings he was somewhat combative himself in the hearings not to not like Brett Kavanaugh was last Thursday but he was certainly pushing back on all of the assertions that were made about him\nAnd so when it finally came to vote in committee he lost in committee Democrats voted against him and when when it went to the floor there were even some Republicans from southern states voted against him because of some\nIs special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United States Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine to advance\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes runs certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nRepublican voted no the only Republican devote no\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes\nUp put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there's at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote\nWhen the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what\nWhat evidence do we have to go on as to the way she's leading well\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters are and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nIs she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of Betsy device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot tensions [laughter] there's your health committee yeah um\nWell done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns about how ... how much you would be strong on public education at the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a Collins and for or against um\nDevice and wound up forcing a Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney had to come down and break a tie on a package of\nTax just a reminder that the vote today as a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and you may choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... is executive vice president for policy at the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ms ...\nCome on and so what are you thinking about this vote\nOn thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's bipartisan opposition to even proceeding are ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are\n... of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American households\nIt's just not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony in considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing to boot [noise]\nThere was one Republican one Republican or out of fifty one who voted no ah this has been a very very partisan vote ... equally part of some of the Democratic side is enough\n[noise] well I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nI usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote\nIt sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is\nBy this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's procedural vote is just the preview for uh the\nThe consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't\nNeed a Totenberg so you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine Blasey Ford letter in early July [noise]\nUm and you you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which a Christian shifts both [laughter] so ah ...\nYou know and and Dianne Feinstein said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone\nIt it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein\nAs ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality\nAnd I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story how do\nYou think about that was it impossible for her to tip off the FBI to mention it to someone so there could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward\nFrom Rhode Island or to the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\nYou know share it with other members and still preserve confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as Senator Feinstein really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or stuff has been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another ... or at least one of the lawmaker who had possession of a letter we don't know who else might have been told\nAnd in what way both in the end\nIt leaked do you believe it all to ... we had to lick was there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been on corroborated I'm Better at an individual will do more to go on the record\nI I don't know who leaked it but I think that what this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week is\nThere are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly confessed to a senator or they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women\nHave experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good\nAnd I'm I'm really worried that Christine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter at a campaign rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "05"}
