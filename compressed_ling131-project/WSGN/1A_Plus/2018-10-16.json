I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about or that ... they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than\nWhat we just said with Michael says that they say when they say that and then but what about ... scientists who say it's worse than ever\nClearly climate change it's tough to discuss despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its existence or maybe because of that evidence\nI mean think about it if someone tried to hit you over the head with a bunch of facts and figures Supreme Lee confident that they are right and you are wrong\nHow would you feel or if someone flat out refused to hear you out despite the facts being really clear and just dug in their heels to avoid feeling like they lost an argument\nWould that be like we want to elevate this debate to change the way we talk about climate change and we want to hear from you where do you stand on the issue and what is it been like discussing it with people whose views are different from yours what's worked and what has not email us one a at\nW.

seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add or comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking\nAbout all this it's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions what we lack or political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states denies factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico\nAustin everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he will consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe it and you know\nThis is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through and through relationship and trust and empathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really base emotions and fear anger\nUm [noise] I anxiety\nAll of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions ... into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean\nIt's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change which we discuss last week on this program and not feel like well we're all going to die anyway\nWhy bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be around and collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go\nA Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions on environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nI didn't realize it HFCs these are some of the the refrigerant chemicals that kind of kind of safe and the heat out of a refrigerator and help it than to

Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage\nThe test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking\nHead of the midterms if you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nNow if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life\nWhat did you discover and how did it change you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nNow to our conversation with Sarah my ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts you down and dreams you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and a poll I Wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with the thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours no doubt per se\nHey policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there were a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like a congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is\nAn imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nAnd I think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and the useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to\nThat well I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have to have it in that um that that those projections are coming through I mean all of that pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations and we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise] [noise]\nYes and there's ... there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that ...\nIt confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been ... oscillation between glacial in inter glacial states\nAbrupt warming ... followed by slow cooling into glacial states so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun\nSarah backup along and they're changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial stayed last me it's so cool it's amazing like oh what is confusing like like bring it down to earth from me\nOkay so in the last million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American\nAnd you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nUm it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold too warm or cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the way goals and ... of the geometric\nIn earth orbit and earth pills as it moves around the sun\nSo I Want to make sure following you just yeah just heartbeat this earth heartbeat between hold too warm\nCold War it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right at like ... okay that makes a youthful\nPattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was at least they are on a super high cholesterol\nSugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and the climate system can't take that forever\nThat will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people aware of this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distrust individual\nSense of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases they're under stating the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually\nBenign climate science what I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house professorial lecture at American University Center for environmental policy\nAnd a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you Josh and Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ...

I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area\nIt was the first major speech on cyber as national security threat think about that it's now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat and it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica bicker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... treaty division exploit social media in order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling\nA company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin on the also on the back end had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named ... Hussein he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to them was turn it into a kill list that said using this customer information\nAre located from his safe hole and Rocca a Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of this stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live\nThat's the new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal threats merge or blend with terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world that function before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John if Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a where hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world in different countries and they used a hack\nTo simultaneously allow them to withdraw money from me at ... I think Michelle does have a point you know for twenty five years\nWe moved to almost everything we value from analog space from books and papers to digital space\nAnd connect it using a protocol the Internet's protocol that was fundamentally never designed with security in mind huge advantages to that economic convenience however we did so systematically and this was true in government along with the private sector without taking into account\nRisk without taking into account that the bad guys the terrorists the the rogue nation states the crux are going to move into that space we're just starting to reckon with that\nNow and it's vitally important we get it right because we're about to have another revolution towards the Internet if things now it won't be our books in papers right

now might be a good time to go check your Facebook account\nThe most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you love right in without having type your password Everytime\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work\nYeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or try to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to race it's game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good that connecting people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities in businesses but it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent this\nAnd then hate speech as well as developers and data privacy Facebook talks endlessly about its community and that the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda\nOver the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through in its reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policy so for instance terror propaganda now we remove the terror propaganda that we removed from Facebook more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us\nNow once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies\nIt comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages a and making a decision if it violates the policy than Denver mayor that if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's\nGot to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire content reviewers who speak a different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have\nNative language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used so that's a big focus and are hiring once you're hired as a content reviewer you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one\nSo for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nYou catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook that violates its terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the cost\nA bag and then ... we still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery\nOr terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at a time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how's that pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves for instance if you misrepresented yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise buy within our content policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody\nThen it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that is going to come through to our review teams first and so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that one\nThere if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or light or copy and then there's other options and in those other options there's an option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world that is learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive I think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it\nAnd because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time to have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience in finding these reporting options and even just understanding how this works so we actually do the options that we offer people to report content actually do vary by location and we're always testing ways to get\nMore report to us to make it easier now there's a tension here if you just have one big red button and people can press it whenever they want them to things happen one is that people might report things when what they really mean it's just to hide it and get the content away from them because they don't like that person and the other thing that happens is we don't have enough information about the post\nTo routed to the correct reviewer right away so you'll notice when you report something on Facebook we ask a couple of questions not many but a couple of because we want 'em to find out a little bit more should this be going to one of our bullying experts and does this need to go to somebody who is a German speaker", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day":
