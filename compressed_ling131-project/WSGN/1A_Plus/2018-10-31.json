A. M. U. dot org me get to a few more of\nYour comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as the vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans hate is now fair game at high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now\nWonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can tap into something that wasn't already there\nWell I think that's a completely fair position I mean you know the United states has had along problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular\nLink during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a set off white supremacist you were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet itself has allowed this kind of material to proliferate\nRadicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior air as so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nNick how do you see it uh there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout through the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political ah aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization and up opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs was noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level uh he should be leading the discussion in a way that is more productive than\nOther thing to think about though is what is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a violent to a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera\nBut in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I\nWonder though Nick how much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power\nBut ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those already of weapons for sure and they led to a war ah you know yeah\nI I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about this I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nPeople I Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term ... media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who've commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to de twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime and Jim\nLimbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera be of permeated our society and uh finally elected veer leader which only embolden them Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that going back in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has has publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your sense of how much of an oval various media outlets plan this\nIt's a great question and I think that um there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is the reciprocal ruled that used to exist between the president and the press\nUm it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured a and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that uh is especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message or you know on Twitter he has followers many of them are bought 'em but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right\nUm because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good puppet of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities um and and so in this case a lot of times the press is been guilty of amplifying those messages when they shouldn't have\nHighly America wonder how much you put the blame on various media outlets versus the president I feel like at this point we're kind of use\n... it's almost a trope in our culture I mean\nThe new Spiderman game on the PlayStation has J Jonah dream is and the guy used to be the publisher of the daily bugle where Peter Parker worked\nAs an AM talk show host whose whole job is to criticize Spiderman and it comes up in the storyline like we're so used to this it almost feels like background noise whereas the president always feels like foreground but that's kind of ... concern is that the president always feels like foreground how to use it as\nSupport for

conversation with Jennifer ... by Rick and Nick Gillespie a few more of your comments Fernando tweeted we are all adults at adults take responsibility for their own actions the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally\n... can you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president has denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred in all its forms\nThen in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on that Tuesday I think\nHe said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder\nHow you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nI'm In ... after I answer I'm so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial I'm In these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggests that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge um what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie coffee in GQ\nUm and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nUm and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie ... had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me um and then to accuse\n... other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy um and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nI'm In that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um admit that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective do Jennifer's in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this kind of wondering what your take is on us to refer to President Trump\nOr does she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue you call all the people who are elected him supporters enablers of a demagogue at a time when something like this happens but it's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term\nSo um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first step in addition of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is bad etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and has voters once who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue into bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own game\nFor the use of the word is the use of the word accurate though it may be use it\nHelpful\nI think so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but his specially in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies\nOf I'm wanting to uh\nYou know jail people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies um which are are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHardy I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nAs just heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left saying that they use similar\nHere's a sample of some of what they're referring to read his time for us because Democrats to be as tough as they are dedicated his arm to be committed is Michele always is you don't when they go low we go low we can [noise]\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect his strength\nBut of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi what about the ... across the political spectrum how does that factor into into our current climate well there's no question\nThat there was ... as well on the left\nBut I think it's a little ridiculous to try to say sort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville but there's some sort of equivalent scare the real nastiness is coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on immigrants\nMuslims global is which many people would argue are anti Semitic theories and there's something else more the violin is coming from the right we don't have domestic terrorism that's out of control from leftist that used to be the case in the Nineteen sixties\nOn carpenter is a

U. dot org\nA conscience gritty let me come back to you let's talk about the nineties a little bit there are two particular nineties references that I Love you to react to one of them\nIs one that has been getting a lot of attention lately because it's celebrated its twenty fifth anniversary this year here's Bette Midler caffeine to Jimmy and Sarah Jessica Parker in Nineteen Ninety three in hocus pocus be must find a book the new the post\nAnd its allies mature enough Salem also and I I just can't we\nCan't we just foul come\nTheir head and he ... he had to flee when he started out with the adventures and he says slow lane\n... focus from Nineteen Ninety three I was Thirteen I saw this in the movie theaters I was like I don't know why\nFrom Nineteen Ninety six years Robin Tony and Rachel True in the craft I drink and my sister and I asked for they cannot have those who gave me especially racist piece of simply bonds score on the\n... two very different kinds of depictions from the nineties but but were there any common bonds to\nI think there are certain similarities um I think both of those movies are sort of grappling with the kind of wizard of Oz Margaret Hamilton idea of the ways that we talked about earlier right the idea of the which is this weekend a threatening woman who is the villainous types the status quo\nAnd in hocus pocus the way it sort of deals with that is it makes a which is fun and bumbling and they're not totally threatening because there's still a bad at what they're doing um but in the end of course the the modern caves\nAre victorious in the witches are sent away and\nAre defeated and you don't have to worry about them ever again the craft kind of wants to embrace the idea of the wicked witch a little bit more it sort of the joy of that movie is watching ... grills gain access to this power in sort of spiraled out of control and go feral in this kind of really satisfying way\nBut at the end of the movie they still have to be returned to restore it to the status quo right because it would be too threatening at that point in time if they got to just have all of this on channel the power so the source of their power which is officially gender this but the movie consistently refers to him as a male and sometimes they call him daddy\nThe source of their power puts restrictions on them\nAnd the only the witch who\nSort of response to those restrictions appropriately ... gets to keep her power the ones who rebel against those restrictions and try to just do whatever they want get punished and have to be\nSort of sent off to an insane asylum and straight jackets in order for the status quo to be restored so in a way both of these movies are about the idea of wanting to bring the wicked witch fantasy into the ... the twentieth century and wanting to get access to that power but not being quite able to do so with wholeheartedly\nGlad to hear from some of you about your favorite references to which is your music and movies TV and books more tweeted Sylvia ... Taliban and the which the C. A. L. I. B. A. and the Taliban and the which\nIs essential reading on how early capitalism and massaging the witch hunts were tied together and the current season of American\nIt's sort of broad city called which is when Abby and a lotta learned to embrace wishing is as a powerful part of womanhood and perhaps actual magic\nChristians solely let's talk a little bit about American horror story particularly the third season of the anthology series American horror story covered in which takes place in New Orleans here is Jessica Lange as Fiona good from the third season\nShare to down here and had company with about as much as the next five pounds of raw\nAnd Marie them all the way back which reminds me drink\nJessica Lange us feel good in American horror story coven now Kristin feel good is not very good in the series she sucks people's life forces to remain eternal young but she's always got a quip she's one step ahead of our enemies she dresses fabulously\nAnd it seems like even when which is our evil in pop culture they still kind of are portrayed as enviable\n[noise] yeah I think it goes back to the ... type is often a one of the stations at the ... that we see\nAnd um yeah we were afraid of her um but we love her you know were drawn to these things that we fear and I think that's that's what makes which is so appealing particularly someone like the on and we want to see her be wicked and\nThen we want to see her be punished for it unfortunately that's what most people want to say and so that's kind of what plays out within that serious it up to any spoilers although it was many years ago so he probably seen it [laughter]\nI Wonder how you see that the crust than I mean you know when when we look at the the way that different struggles for\nEquality or for social ascendancy are depicted you know sometimes it's the it's a very ... it it feels like a similar cycle you know you have these these characters that are very noble and then eventually we get to these characters that are renegades you know we have\nThis Sidney ... is the first wave and then you've got black ... she got shaft it's the second wave you have these characters who are are very admirable and noble and then you'd have cattle characters who are like you know screw it I'm chicken butts in taking names\nYeah I mean I it just speaks to the the complicated nature of actual human being so in that way they're sort of a human ... and that's happening when we see these multifaceted which is\nIf on be which that's the one which I never liked because of her husband's demands that she not use her powers of oh yeah ... I Wonder if you could could help me with this ah the use of the word which I don't know if you've encountered this but I've encountered\nLot of men who have used the W. word because they knew they weren't allowed to use the B word this word is very charged for a lot of men I mean\nEven that song by Frank Sinatra witchcraft where he says there's just no nicer which than you I think that's kind of a sideways reference to that B word is that something we have to grapple with\nAbsolutely and we see it in politics all the time you can Google pretty much any female politician and no matter what side of the aisle they're on you will find them photoshopped as a which\nI'm so this really is still a negative epithet that a lot of people use to put women in their place to shame them on to shut them up especially women who are in the public eye who have opinions and to dare to speak their mind\nYeah and I I I Wonder kind of cost us where we do\nWith that mix connotation a Noel wrote on our Facebook page\nI don't see the concept of which is as a positive feminist forcing mainstream American society if a woman says she identifies as a witch in any sense of the word she's only embrace without identification and pagan culture the word which still has negative connotations like witch hunt\nSo I don't see it as a way for feminists to assert themselves and be hurt a strong powerful voices in society\nAnd Kathleen wrote on our Facebook page here's what I learned as a young girl from the wizard of Oz well behaved sweet witches are always beautiful graceful and kind which is to strive for power are ugly mean and bitter not exactly a feminist message Constance\nYeah I mean I think that the listeners aren't around the either the messages that I mean one of the lines in the wizard of Oz rate is\nA door and he said which is our old and ugly and Linda says no on the bad witches are old and ugly good way to get it for their general there's definitely a kind of classic

Carpenter is a master of horror movies end of the soundtracks to bring them to life his latest project as a return to the film that launched his career\nHalloween John Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he's the composer on the twenty Eighteen sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from a Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nWhen the producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back I knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the the son of the ...\n... ah talk to me and they said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we\nMeaning he he and I\nI'm getting bored and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been was cinema since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worst other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that you're right ah it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell ever or did they at least understand let me think a a\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny\nThey're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure so forth and so on so director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot like 'cause it's tiny it's all about timing\nAnd it's all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but um people just think that horror as a lot of war and obvious violence and it's not\nYeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well or on blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience ... what do you think it takes to make that kind of timing in ...\nThat only the Brotherhood no so I Can't\nOh come on you can tell me something\nWell look to make it really simple\nUh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every\nAction think of it that way not a genre necessarily torture reaction to things and that if the story is is unfolding then you use the story tell it to a a a set up your scares and set up things they're\nFrightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and a feeling for him\nThat's what it takes now were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or was it something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nNo I I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise]\nA virtuoso violin player and he had taught a college level music courses at a university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old and I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violent to the piano and tar and other things I picked a lot of stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five ... ...\nIt taught me five four on that and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing so\nAdapted that time's signature during the piano piece and we'll\nWe're speaking to John ... the director of dozens of heart classics including probably some of your favorites Halloween to thing Christine prince of darkness escape from New York\nAlso a
