A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record it hug be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what you want to say the holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how did he distinguish himself\nNo votes for the question though we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure at hard you know for years decades of\nA different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD has the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that had never been put into a rural\nInto the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had equal housing opportunity\nIn their community and I'm very proud of it uh unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back um through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home and we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity\nFolks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing dean\nTweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is Huck doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor secretary bank are yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken in the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also the ... work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bubble\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know\nThat President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nIt as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalates\nOur farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China are but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture as you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are some of them okay what's the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nOr you know I think a lot of folks can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by\nA while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment with the leadership of of uh some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president in twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nAh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA one of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can [noise]\nOf of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment uh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics and warehousing I'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from a perspective of the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nYou know I I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town\nHow many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost\nI see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American like the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully\nCobble life together what do you say that those folks in terms of the future of trade here\n[noise] uh what I say is that number one I'm\nYou know we need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time ah we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a essentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities\nUnderstanding the assets of each of those communities um your water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may not be located there now that we can actively along with the private sector work on getting their\nAh and then how does that relate to to each of these trade deals and the thing is that what's missing from the Trump Administration is any kind of\nA fought for plan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebuke of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end or it none of these things seem to have a plan behind\nA significant part of your story is obviously an immigrant story so I Want to ask you about immigration policy particularly because uh\nIt's not on all of his policies you right in the book\nAbout the difficulties you and other Latino families experienced kind of struggling families you worked with poor Americans homeless Americans while you were HUD secretary give me a sense of what\nOr W.

I don't wanna hurt jobs tell everybody what's at stake here you know well there's a lot of ... there's a lot at stake and\nMaybe especially so because this man was a reporter is something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really\nTerrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see we're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment\nPresident Trump speaking to us we stole in an interview that aired last night on sixty minutes Sarah what do you make of that\n[noise] um well I think it's definitely a an indication that President Trump is trying to appear to be taking this more seriously\nUh initially I think uh he and others were hoping they could sweep this under the rug with a lot of if fans um you still hear hear the if then language\nA in a President Trump's remarks but there's also a promise of a severe punishment um which is interesting and important\nI think the other piece of this that is distressing and interesting is that while every single American administration has sold weapons to a tyrannical abusive governments are like Saudi Arabia\nUm there was also a little bit of embarrassment about it it was something that uh wasn't boosted about and uh there were sort of measures of condition analogy that would be attached\nI think President Trump is the first president that is just clearly make at least saying I'm that well this is about dollars and\nUh it doesn't really matter what the other side does we're never going to sacrifice her dollars for it um and I think it's maybe it's a good thing to expose the harsh reality of of what us arms sales are really all about 'em but I think it will also make people very very uncomfortable\nOr to recognize that it's a value free transaction that that the U.S government the purports\nTo stand for certain values actually doesn't care about them if it means a enriching blockades in the ... of this world you're let's clarify what some of the luxury\nThough of it being about defense if you will and\nI'm In that could lead dollars I'm under not just Trump yeah I I Do want to ask\nYou about those dollars themselves we got one listener who wrote on our website the one eight dot org please discuss this one hundred ten billion dollars how much is really contracted and over how many years how much is just letters intent caring we've been hearing about this hundred and ten billion dollar deal do we know what the substance of that really is\nWill that is what the president announced when he visited Saudi Arabia in June of twenty Seventeen\nEven thin and I'm not the\nLeading expert on this by any means but even then\nMany people said some of that is already sold some of that is still not contracted so this is a kind of\nMystical aspirational promise number as opposed to the checks in the mail and um [noise] Bruce writes Dale at Brookings who is more expert on it\nSays that there have been at an essence most of that is still on the calm this is not um money that the Saudis have paid\nUm it is true that every time Trump says ... you know have got to pay their way I mean we\nWe are not unlike we are with NATO allies warned not funding Saudi Arabia to the fans ah we they do pay by buying American arms so I'm Trump is uh his desire to sell them more\nAh and get jobs is perhaps understandable if you're an American president but he is wrong and saying that we're somehow\nAnswering telephones um we also want to thank our guest artists each go around this time it's Eric Poland for his a lovely\nDesign for the the WB H M painting glass and mug\nFor an eight dollar a month sustaining contribution you can have that mug by Eric ... you can see it at our website or to great design um\nThat the ah depicting what WBAI ... means to the artist and how he thinks we uh his representation of WB H M and the community for a one hundred and twenty dollar donation either all in a lump sum are spread out over over ten dollar a month\nA increments you can get a Eric Owens tiny glass just two of our thank you gift here WBAI Jim\nFor your financial support this is Ninety point three WB H M Birmingham in one oh four point five W.

A. M. U. dot ... before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved for Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul Page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. V. O. M. radio back in July here's part of what means governors said\nOr one thing I Know is nobody can force me to put the state and reading and I will not\nThere have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nThat's part of Maine Governor ... speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean how's this going to end\nWell a ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh ... was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that uh\nUh he probably shouldn't have one in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters um the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point Paula pages turn out this year uh the Democratic candidate is leading in most of the surveys that are that that up there\nUm but it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need and and this is a it's a problem in Maine especially in a communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs and\nA ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs an issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Brian Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those\nA pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers Kennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with the air with the pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because of that is consistently one of the big complaint so we hear from our\nConstituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this will\nBe these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of the low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug price issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nYeah that that will be let federal legislation in the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggling to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gangs clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the no the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act and uh\nObviously based in the navy you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a\nSchool the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that but now we have it then it's going to really drive prices\nScott ... back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws and the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is in that\nThe words they are are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a price increases increases beyond a certain point and the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reverse in some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill\nOr in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five more states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program\nTo exclude some drugs from the a formula or the the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all\nFDA approved drugs in their formula Larry the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make sure understand the argument from Massachusetts when they were trying to do anything he said the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now right now for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts\nAnd you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive and we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that\nPart of the exactly that's right I mean interestingly enough in this uh uh the federal government though it rejected a mass at the Massachusetts effort\nA President Trump has proposed that there'd be a pilot program where five states would be able to um to do this what Massachusetts wants to do and in addition to change the way that a Medicaid works with regard to drug prices and allow these five pilots states\nTo negotiate directly with drug makers rather than um adhering to this national\nPrice formula so there is interest even though a this Massachusetts after was shut down for now there is interest in in this idea of one of the criticisms\nThat's exactly it thank you so much one eight

or radio quality audio files through our app won a vox pop or series the state we're in continues next Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from months in law who tweeted\nIsn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support is that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high\nDeductible well of course the people who have an employer plans with hijacked our our big problem and the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductible so you have to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to uh basically filling with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way they Affordable Care act was created was those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get\n'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts and they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plants and they wouldn't\nStates are doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned ... was simple set of healthcare costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and that needs to be versatility\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states\nScale do an enormous amount of regulation of health care they always have the federal government has always been sort of the things you and your partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act was trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were beforehand\nWell as Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that they are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example\nA on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... a offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they're joined the federal level um insurance is regulated at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it's the it's kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalize the recreational use voters\nAnd I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states\nInto more conservative areas overtime or yeah and it's not just the medical that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota\nA medical ... no for legal legal for recreational low you know if her in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of a marijuana legalization tend to be\nA older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more you in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are the and talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement uh ability and the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will then have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there three items in Missouri so they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that they put them on about those are amendment to an amendment three\nAnd then there's a proposition which I if premise wrong I think the proposition goes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California in ...\nIt was also essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pie you can find that on line at the one a dot org\nScott a couple of things to add to it ah read said on this very interesting issue um one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain and then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into marijuana bills or this idea that a\nA minority communities have been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization that makes sense to include in these bills provisions that uh\nThat ... on the one hand would allow people to uh to expunged they're a criminal records for small amounts of marijuana but also some of these bills are calling for investment in these communities that we're most impacted and and also as a Reid said it's a big business\nA step up for for people who are members these communities so they can get into this very lucrative business", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "15"}
