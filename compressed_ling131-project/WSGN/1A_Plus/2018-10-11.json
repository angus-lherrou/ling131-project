I I Do a lot of interviews and nobody ever asked me that so I appreciate that [laughter] I'm good I think that like I'm a I'm a\nHappy about being around the people I knew before the protests and people that I Know really well I got to see my sister the other day and and she's grade and her two kids so\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with the bone a certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise in customer service contract to locate her and more information or at Boehner dot com\nAnd from ... committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise locations matinees him dot com slash NPR\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream accustomed to host of the podcast pod saved the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching help lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I like don't you can myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like every single day I had to show up as I taught sixth grade math every single they had to show up and I was math to my students I had to be as prepared and I'm sixty nine hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever there an eleven year old\nUh what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are to be consumed and could be repeated back so my skill was like what I learned was not only how to like get kids to understand like with an equation was but like I did teach discreet skills like you know what you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right but like [noise]\nAnd if they can put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impact so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggled like they can get it like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it\nBy the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it and that was like understanding like the arc of how to\nBuild capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got their\n... and that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know them and I believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after we're gone\nLet's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo when we think the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who are in the street in Ferguson we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organize everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate is that there's this narrative that it's that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations that that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who are industry in St Louis who did and credit\nAnd to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names\nAre in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's I guess most of the people who like started every thing and the movement or that there's a small set of organizations who like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end emily's seep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book raised to like that so I think about the book specifically\nBut in general in the space like I'm mindful of this ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that us\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of nonprofits than we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first of the database of police union contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done ever before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not a I'm a salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nAh and with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense\nUm and it's not like some huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's like I ... at the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter] now late at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like he was a really rough um it was rough\nOnly this only a couple of months ago was the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of um like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's not sustainable some say it but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like\nThere are these narratives of like oh I made ... dollars and it's like well no you like see me on the news you came in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before you know that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant though I'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another text club or who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nWhat do you think he I think you know I think for ...\nFor two thousand years we slip people's arresting called a health care we literally drain people's ... down and we were like ... it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh ... their blood pressure changes like no they didn't have any blood writing like that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical\nIf the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good and like this was excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so you look at the clearance rates and violent crime all across the country like\n\nSupport

NPR station\nBack now to our conversation with to Raymond kissing his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book like page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write quote I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of\nTraumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward active as\nKnow it's interesting uh this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I have to re read the book we should talk [noise] and I just haven't I haven't done with the right back yet so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the chapters ... I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she can leave and it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize is that like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their dignity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass on what not to ask why new like when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside you know a lot of people talk about\nIf the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can't start that magic things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't know that they were seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller about a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times in a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet\nBecause I've never been any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was in Port in for me to be out very very\nUm [noise] I mean amount for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\n... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was a real like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a black man and like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work that all of us have collected with them and social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about my own identity\nNow I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just said ... and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and you know when I\nUsing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me I'm so like\nYou know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives in like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right\nAs I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all their career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people\nAre OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my ... and\nThey have to yeah you know like I think\nWe have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave that like there's not one way right that there's not two ways to be gay they're like\nThe pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like that I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live in like other people can feel like it's real re\nSo like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now they're trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people when people get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the results but that\nAh that they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that to me it's fascinating\nThey're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who like are really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your hate\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote\nI Wonder how you are finding your way\nForward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so in a way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism word that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nNo it's like a both and great that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in Washington Post and people literally there were like you're wasting your employees I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now like that is that ... that was a wild statement said then it's wild to say today so I think that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that this president continues to\nTo put in the face and you think about even there are a lot of really really public people and movements aides who literally just would not say anything about Hillary that wasn't she was a monster and like you don't have to agree with all the Hillary stuff to know that like she was a better choice in this guy so so that was sort of

Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire fifth season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about season five right let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty\nBig amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a ... actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh when I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be on a press to her talking about a show a little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about when and putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the ah tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nIt it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who knew you know a touches a show and turned it into gold\nAnd it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the ah directors brings so much to the episodes of the story about ants\nI bet yes I'm doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word played the slapstick the ponds and the Pratt falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nFor him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny um but we really\nAre mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season and what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's a talking octopus\nOr you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so this story is quite serious\nAh but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your for\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show [laughter] no\nI mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American audience\nI I think you know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons and um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the bubble um or the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to say\nThe south park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men um and and so I\nI wanted this to feel more like a drama the hum and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously um but but but those shows were certainly influences as\nWell at one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah we'll our net as Beau jak Amy today are credible artist Carolyn sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and then a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at\nSome yeah I'm ... one of the first people we cast [laughter] and I was cast her whale\nAs a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda Lamont and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role and really and we call them like yeah sounds like fun um and he's fantastic we keep bringing back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had them do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of as a very serious man are goofing around going\n[noise] you know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Allison Aubrey is Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this in the show now deceased and that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her\nUm how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it well um we cast Alison\nOr in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we've been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be a leader\nBeing a and she's going to a a great job ever since um but more and more are as I was looking around at the cast and and thinking about you know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our cast was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is like I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices or tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically\nUm you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's the thing that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character\nAnd you know as I said in these other interviews um I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this won't become the thing that I ended up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there was also talking ... you know anti eaters and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how was an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nI I think there are differences and I'm more interested in exploring them now and I feel like\nThe uh avoidance of the issue\nWas holding us back narrative way well instead of avoiding it then you took responsibility for it on your own initiative and and as I said in season five\nDiane confronts those issues directly for herself makes a trip to Vietnam and narrates an entire episode about the experience for her um I also mentioned ... voice of princes currently she's my she's my favorite character I just love that\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the

many more but the performers might just rely on one crew member more than any other the cue card holder\nNYC cue cards handles all the cue card work in New York a decidedly low tech job but some productions refused to do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nAh thanks for having me Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother is working at a time as a receptionist\nAnd ah they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and uh uh I got the job and I did I did it just get my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make some money connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I'm On my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one of the specially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that the you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly and the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live\nUm the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master\nWe do all the Project Runway that shoot and then we do to show any show that comes to the town that he's ... guards you know work on that as well\nNeat printing now my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between the between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the streets okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train it for like two or three weeks I'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you\nCan't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interviews ... these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card a courage to stand on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next car just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York okay so let's say you're working for me for you know\nThe late night with Joshua Johnson and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nLike near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses were your glasses on the show where you were contacts are we're not we're either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you're wearing a glass of so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger\nSo that you could see but that would also make less words in the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to say you got to wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we were we were to have her son's ride would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you or looked arrests\nHow do you mean it looked as regularly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play those cue cards now if you are looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later the audience will be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the cameras so yeah so I'll I Will open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cards and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical working week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsal is on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it\nIt'll change from Thursday sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the without the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturn show day\nSo everything's printed I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set\nSo sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you a lawyer you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ... there is a little\nBit of both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced and the people that want the ... in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related\nBut yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leads to Saturday where ever heard of that then they come out from behind the scenes and there were her sing with me 'cause I Can't\nI Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cards at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nHow close up to Showtime say for Saturday Night live how close are you writing up to Showtime\nWe don't stop making changes usually until ... sometimes twelve thirty at night ... night while the show was going on\nSo you could still be writing while you're alive\nOr we are we definitely are um we we get most of the changes done and and then the the problem that happens is that the show starts running late and there's maybe two sketches that lord would like to get in so he'll tell the writers need to cut", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "11"}
