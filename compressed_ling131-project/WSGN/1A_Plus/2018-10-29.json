I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like ... job is not the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome\nLooks like you short well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there is anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ...\nBeing that that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top when the president at the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we had somebody\nOn the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ... yet but it was either\nA ... I'm Sorry where am I going to do you want to get a little deeper into that\nA lot of thought 'cause a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other form of\nEvil and unfortunately evil comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning he wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the opened an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote\nGotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan is in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes I look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers\nCredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people I'm going to be under the tree enemy that people I mean this is\nThis absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we are not able to inform and educate citizens um about what's going on in their country if we are not able to hold\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from visiting angels\nVisiting angels America's Choice in senior home care office locations are visiting angels dot com\nAnd from

confidence\nBack now to our conversation with rabbi Jill Jacobs Charlie ... let's get some more of your questions and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre\nIt was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping trumped telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful device of speech that is anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rats if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks orange forever the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who is both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower than on the left of people who have a starting with religious is at a close connection\nAnd a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable in college you know bill that um you know the express a strong here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up in and how you were high school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know ah not physically\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave the school\nYou know they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh\nSo I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids who probably should need need to shut up you know\nAnd I'm a fish out of it but the you know you can't argue with every just kind of you're going to have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard\nThing you have to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised students to do that\nAnd not the not federal everything will David ... book can be can be very hard\nDavid let me put that to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of Davis comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and I'll laugh and very often it expresses itself\nAs a as a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of his trials governmental policies that we are all this\nYou have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store and a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred\nA race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government it would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nMake it to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation we get as many of your calls as we can't as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better\nIndira would you react to that I feel like part of what\nWorked I hate to say in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had someone crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nMean scroll hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to CMU\nLawyers professors teachers accountants dentists it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall is also um you know politically liberal community and voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community as Pittsburgh overall and the mayor um built to do do has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago an attacker killed five reporters and Annapolis news the Capitol is that so you know I I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line\nUm I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nJust attack on the one in here just mention CNN is reporting that a suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted at a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least yielded any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today\nSure what what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors do an after all this\nUm puns very upset it's you know it's it's it's devastating of a family or friends and customers in there and live with a squirrel hill it's um we're taking a brutal hit\nMe too movement has revolutionized how America talks about sexual harassment how much is it changing the laws to protect victims and punish harasser\nFrom W.

the details\nBecame apparent immediately after the incident really is it it's it's not known or it's not clear if uh the gunmen had\nAny criminal records believe that he didn't have any criminal record beforehand but you know he was heard by witnesses and did according to a complaint later tells swat officers who are removing him from the scene they just you know yelling very anti Semitic clearly anti Semitic messaging including\nAll Jews must I Am going to kill all the Jews and that's reflected in his social media posts both immediately before the incident\nAs well as stretching back a good ways so we do know that he was of that any allergy uh but the investigation is really still ongoing the the site is still closed due to forensic investigation and the FBI and other enforcement is really still screening through his social media posts and conducting interviews in the lake so we'll learn more details as those sort of come out\nHouse the city of Pittsburgh coping with all this right now what's the mood like in town [laughter]\nIt's a blue collar placed right like the real tough place then I think that that's become very very clear in recent days is the community has come together\nUm it's it's tough it's a tragedy that has obviously most directly impacted our Jewish community but that doesn't mean that everyone isn't really rallying behind this issue and to support

professor at Oregon law school she's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome\nThanks for having me and Suzanne ... is the program director of the employment labor in retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us\nYes thanks ... we'd also love to make time for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state what went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover it and who don't become so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment lives um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the with the facts\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that if you work for a very small employers that are a lot doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... in the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to them\nWho they're covering yeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduce legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements\nOr an enforced arbitration agreement so we've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York\nTennessee California as you mentioned Vermont in Washington\nAnd other states are also looking at extending training requirements um so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that pass in um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from an ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it can change your reputation I really wish I could ever protect myself in both situations are just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFor us for tipping how common is this for freelancers and being a situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive to provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaint system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nSpeaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University this year BU required\nThe legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expending sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that there's been creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention to workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in the workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment\nWell when you think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system so\nPart of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law firm lawyers to get out of them\nAnd a lot of states have really low caps on damages so if you through your employer the maximum amount of money that you can get from them you know in some states might be fifty thousand dollars that's not much of a deterrent for employers who are trying to decide how much to invest in their systems to address harassment\nObviously our series is about what state lawmakers are doing to address a number of hot button issues across the country and let's hear from one state lawmaker right now in California joining us now on the line is California state senator ... Jackson she's a Democrat representing a district that includes Santa Barbara\nSo they can prepare for life's ups and downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com\nAnd from American University's ... school of business committed to business being a force for meaningful change through graduate and to undergraduate degrees mission driven curriculum and a hands on approach Morris co God don't American dot edu\nNo short conversation about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment was Emily Martin of the national Women's Law\nWell assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth tip it's we woke up some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or field you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email won a a W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... and so I was like ... California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's been a real leader in the space both with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session\nAs well as if you love the unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time off and for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon\nFor other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws in meaningful ways many states Emily that you're targeting in particular [noise]\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement as a condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and I'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out\nThe Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment or place in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder Susan and if we could dig into the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements most of the legislation that we've seen\nUs specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily ban nondisclosure and great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people sign at the start of their employment that says keep our information confidential and that was another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they have hired a lawyer and those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because\nBoth parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line that case\nFor someone who stick with you from it I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful\nIn terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions with federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that does can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts and away educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiffs lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning this information aren't at the table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say in whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws or cross state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise help bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on well that's a great question\nIf you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond setter ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed and win state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in another but it's important to remember\nOur core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about that no matter you know what's it called they live in\nA suicide I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nRight now we're considered one of the most litigious states and the nation's one source I just looked up said we're number six six out of fifty own worst states for litigation\nMatter of fact if you divide of the country into\nFive four regions the south has one hundred and eighty six cases like that her ten thousand people the next closest section as Fifteen one tenth less than one
