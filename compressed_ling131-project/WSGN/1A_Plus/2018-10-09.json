A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments before we keep going\nNick is in Wilmington North Carolina Mick rights I'm In North Carolina and the G O P state super majority pushed a bill through last year to not release any body can footage to the public except for family members involved to view if I could make one law to increase mixed trust with the public this would be the one\nBe Sean wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd assess wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people hearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man\nUh no I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the key to all of this and that is that decision that the court made many years ago and the Graham case that basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force\nIn much basically take be in the seat that that the steps of the state of the officer\nSo it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer have\nDone it in that situation so it is not an object that look is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do and as a result you find very few\nJudgments first of all you know in in civil ensuing police departments are jurors have to again how hold the standard\nAnd prosecutors before they decide to\nTo charge an officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation had done\nSo it is the Supreme Court that has set this rule for all law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd there are over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court set of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the cheeses Graham versus Connor Institute's from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually comments with regards to what's going on in officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like to do with the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force in the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military were they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon ... the Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover\nWorking as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you what what happened that caused such stirred did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were actually involved\nAnd the runny the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and\nTherefore I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI used the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed the officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence was unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nA they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer how law enforcement or my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because I drugs all of us know why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\nYou know honestly a lot of police officers dead approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on us police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nThis code of silence and what was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common straight officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBy says we're actually\nIn ... the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of fear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them\nThey complied because they it it's easier and easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't\nWant to they felt they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWe'll let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police Kevin ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB easiest podcast on the Koran McDonald's case called sixteen shots here is Kevin ...\nWhat I Do I Do believe when some of the politicians I think\nOver the last several years the views this case one thing and I want to remind everybody we answer millions of dollars every every every year and they've used this case to really took ... probably ... which is unfortunate because I'm going to tell you this and um\nThe men and women of the Chicago police departments are some of the finest police officers in this country\nTake seriously\nWhat they do and they try and provide the best protection again for people who sued in Chicago\nAnd they do is putting their own lives and barrel every single day and night\nBecause Kevin ... the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police shut and I'd love to get your thoughts on what Kevin Graham said I mean it doesn't minimize this look on McDonald's case at least for me but I Do kind of see what he's getting on in terms of getting a bad rap I mean if you want to see a positive portrayal of Chicago police you gotta watch NBC and ...\n... has a point I Do want to stay um most of the Chicago police\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the main office of tourism offering travelers an

climate change leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one egg we'd also love to know what you're working on to fight climate change in a big way\nTell us your story eight five five

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Neal Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will Doris Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and a gun however\nGalvin had these questions Calvin writes the question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force does a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot while they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions\nTo Cornell maybe you should respond a Galvin how do we suss out in a fine or sense what reasonable mess is\nThan than it is in the eye of the the holder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do\nIs put themselves in the shoes\nAnd it's happened and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it but\nBut I Do want us to get to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to re imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is ... militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community\nThat's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments\nArmed to the teeth with\nTanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically\nA patrol and and take care of traffic issues\nWhy can't that come from within the community why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to that deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim brutal and I'm not disagreeing with you just by way of doing some places where the lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer doesn't deal with things like parking enforcement in traffic enforcement things that are less likely to required to be for\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic\nForce and and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have\nOf police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras\nAnd what what happens while we have officers some oh don't turn the cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of trust\nThen police say wait don't get to know who these offices are their track record their history they're disciplined history very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland left this in our inbox\nI talk to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have had experiences where you know we just simply\nYou know would rather have conflict with ah with me rather than actually serve it I really think that they should\nKnow take away the uh for the first couple of months but at least two but she is out of the community without gun makers Dana community to force them to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a ... a lot better uh was serving their communities\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first if we could contrast what Reggie said\nWith another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law out convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cornell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors when something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force were you know none of the people are very few of the people were the ones that you do know there's conflict\nIt goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community decides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever where the community decides what's important with the community decides you know what\nWe can handle these issues at ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that but policing is very political political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors\nAnd we'll never get to that place into the community decides they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing and review boards were part of it including on a larger scale Jamie asked shouldn't there be a national\nGroup or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nPaolo tweeted police forces with their training transformed them from people's defenders into communities photos with this dance to police forces not your friend even if you are a regular law abiding citizen so maybe trainings part of it\nAnd Hector emailed the u._k. and other European Union countries have unarmed on duty police officers and we should have more on armed cops to Patrick Smith I'm not sure if anyone is advocating that any officer than Chicago disarmed themselves but I Wonder what people are suggesting I mean is

boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything butts on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe will also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get refused to go get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared ... is a\nGame you know I understand I mean to review the NAFTA deal to weigh in on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so believe we've all done and if it's a great friend and they do a lot of things the high the thing\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're about our country because they are in um ministry and our\nIn little ones I adore them and continue actually when you know they sacrificed a lot they've cut a lot of time and energy into it um but they have a lot of heart and\nReally wanted to make America proud and so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good slate and on for the next and Vassar to come in but now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd just getting years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the south let's

polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nYeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nLet's see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up if that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that work I'd just needs to be the one person I\nDo to keep my head down and we do not make waves\nAnd being vulnerable and bring it up and in ... that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of ...\nI I think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I've never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble 'cause it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\n\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a star yeah your scars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tender there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive\nYeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog Rice University and then\nTons of data evaluation data so I thought when when\nJust cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long I was like so that blew my hypothesis have fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership\nThe greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThat having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed\n[noise] we are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam and I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee I'm a paramedic and fire fighter and that was such a definitely feel like I Need to do my job perfectly at all times because there are definitely times one lives and livelihoods

better get stressed the job\nAdam thanks very much for calling and sharing your story with us no contrast Adam's story which is a bells story she works in a similarly strict workplace was a rather different take\nI'm a doctor and a big hospital and it's just really hard to suggest that anyone to feel safe there you have to watch everything you say and do and there's so many corporate compliance policy I Would say like it's not a safe place to be human at all\nIs it but we appreciate you sharing your story as well Bernie it sounds like very or one might think they'd be in one of these high pressure leadership environments would lead to more common experiences with both of these folks are in places where laws are on the line with wildly different experience is what's the variable that makes a difference there\nAnd there's another one that we'd like to think as well any sides and Charles sellers thank you so much for your contribution\nProviding customized insurance for small and

P. in the app store\nAnd we'll share some of your stories on Monday when our series this state we're in continues on one day\nBack now to our conversation with ... brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to arm or Monday ... emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah any boundaries are actually a big part of this box because batteries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense it it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I'm an protect feeling good about myself\nOver movie and I work for it\nTo the difference between so there's a difference between say armor and image such as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's ... it's on a deeper level now\nIt's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus daring leadership as one form of armor we see a lot and folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the network and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into ...\nI see that manifest themselves in the workplace disproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust\nWell here's one of the biggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and said that I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nDesert desert everyday traumas and it is real that that that that yeah the armor that you need to survive this thing's Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender as another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the for testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we are more data all got\nTo go yeah who was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core\nValues and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind\nOf mission statement or vision for clarification or posters everywhere saying this is we're supposed to\nBe and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies were the value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what we're even start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled tomorrow down to my to why only two\nWell here's a big if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating\nSo we really don't move your point in my head but little do yeah [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so what was so you know operation allies values into behaviors\nFewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with have actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women who had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know\nThere's a long list in the book like we talked about and it was hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nOh truism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independents self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my ... my two core values for me or faith encourage and I know that the core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational as an end to behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nWas on the values that you were to do is\nLike for example one of our values as take good care taking care of each other ourselves and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you don't\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that has a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable it's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble of phone or ability living into your values which we're talking\nThe anatomy of trust and and learning how to rise had to get back up on your feet after a fall or set back\nDo you need to declare these values I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you live near I now think my to core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list for I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my two were based on who I Am the work I Do like\nI guess one sure catch I sure OK face\nNo\nThere's not one of my two chords but it's incompetent one of my two cars but no fake ... I\nDon't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about ... I Know but I'm the host I don't have to do and I'm just I'm In charge here here we got ... no no I was OK okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and growth those are my two values\nAnd give me an example out of behavior that supports freedom\nUm\nWell for me being out more one thing for its freedom I'm being a better\nListener on this program because if I value the freedom to tell my own story I have to then extend that to you and I can't monopolize this discussion on my best days I Will do for less talking and far more listing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "09"}
