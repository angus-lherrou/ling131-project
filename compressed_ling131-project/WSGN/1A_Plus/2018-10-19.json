A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of ...\nAnd over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of the arguments that split fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best static but we'll see how things play out\nAnd said what area will just go ahead for them it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying I mean look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio ... uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them try to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh will view\nOf the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections I found it telling the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear lose their favorite both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight and overworked came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty six\nYou have of how the candidates came out of that debate\nUm you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know try not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lying in bed I'm attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for or\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nThey rather progressive Democrat like O'Rourke has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nMean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAn undercover aspect of this raises the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go and mark a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength of Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over ark\nHas been able to keep them to single digits\nI was going to make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra intact\nBoat dress counting for all the Republicans on the ticket yet you can basically do for every Republican all at once and this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they would do on Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers out raised Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that corner\nIn the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races also glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas\nKaren tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town in Mexico beach has not reported given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing 'em but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that ... you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they are expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nAlexander the other big issue is when people can actually start to rebuild and I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early ...\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up to the latest building codes and which ones were not because the homes that were up to codes were there and the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any effort is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nCustom quotes and rates are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive\nNow that's progressive and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income dot org\nBack now to the friday news roundup with Josh Rogers Alexandra Jaffe and Franco or don't is still a little bit more time to get in your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from across the country one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nAbsolutely trading him a party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town that we're the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states are enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace to Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris ... says you know part of some sort of resistance movement to design we've obviously she nationally uh you know Chris Pappas\nI worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um and uh this race though is one where the seat can go either way and ah both parties believe they have a shop\nThere's also a gubernatorial race underway here the Republican government Governor Christie new new\nFaces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that tallied the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican three to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... brands listen\nIt's going to help families be happier and healthier it's going to help people to be more productive at work and sell\nIt can win win everywhere I go in this day I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is\nFor people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that most when they're needed them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will it's\nBeen a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge of somebody covering the story of how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue\nHe was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it at the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm you know the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work your way through college and that you know pursue new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get it new\nFor income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ...\nYou know ... should win you know we have to your terms here no governor's been promised after one term\nUh since two thousand four and part about it have been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those uh here polling indicates new news up by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers in\nMali has outrageous Christian in three to one and the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he healed free ... doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand no interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that ... uh buy dinner background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking of nationally\nKnown names Frank or don't use I Wonder what your senses of senators your brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is there is speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty\nUm I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed granted one of the people that that people aren't talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes on is being picked apart um you know analyze a and looking for how it could mean and how it could uh what impact it could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week that the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven\nBy the end of this decade to ... a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly\nThe tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly and in fairness Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though at this rate although the economy is booming there's there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at\nAt this point um it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on\nA welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing\nUm and so going forward you know it's interesting they care or to see Republicans silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits but it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with that\nBut you're disturbing in a trip through in the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid Seventy percent of what we spend every year the subject we were just discussing the funding over Doberman about thirty percent of what was ...\nUm I ... I think Peter said would argue well whether there's value in that but but the point is um we're here for you twenty four hours a day seven days a week and even even more on ... gas or will you be here for a WBAI ... please make your gift right now at WBAI ... dot org\nIf you're in a position to support it we're asking that you do there are people who just depend on this service in aren't able to your donation helps to support it for the heart of Alabama we're asking you to step up now in this final day of our fall fund drive\nEight hundred for for for nine two four six or W.

the former military officer and his daughter Saudi prince denies any involvement in murder of journalists who criticized him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that ... was murdered based on recordings heard by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in them Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that was ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens\nRespond to that yeah absolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states and world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children\nAnd is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that weren't uninvolved party\nUm you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions right and many other things\nI Will say though I dreams I Do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is on entangled but I kind of take Sonia point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it\nWell this was the let me ... me up with about point Josh represents absolutely critical you know someone who's been actually a very good on this is Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them of paraphrasing here but all the money in the world and all of US military contracts in the world would not be\nGet away with this then we may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis\nIs a business relationship and you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been roped killers\nWho took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of a show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or just recognized coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sweep the scent of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence that the Turks now have\nThey've photographed these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of\nThe ... the crown princes security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they are going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWell we will keep an eye on this story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given of course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight\nYesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar the commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped\nUnharmed today the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in that province they were supposed to take place tomorrow those elections will carry on as planned in the rest of Afghanistan despite widespread violence the Taliban have already killed at least\nTen candidates and scores of voters in the ... give us some sense of how the Taliban's efforts might affect the outcome of this election voter turnout the reliability of of the results what's the the kind of upshot of\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by\nBuilding math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day and nine hundred franchise locations not sneezing um dot com slash NPR\nFrom log me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done and learn more it goes to meeting dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\nBack now to the friday\nOpen the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org this week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now\nAnd I got out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana\nNationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen\nAndrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made it official Hays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a global trend something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\nYou know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that when you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at you compare that to things like the un office of drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you weren't you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which he did is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know that I'm sure that Ken is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes a surgeon traffic accidents where their claws asserted tops ... or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting that in this country marijuana is considered the most\nThe ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse there was a conference call this week with Todd oh and who was in the fish will with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point no but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mass right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also dreams what other kinds of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative move there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level might meet for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a controlled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California mirrors dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to him in may when your tax marijuana a and the use has happened in any way and uh\nSo the north for probably going to get a jump on us on this but um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYeah this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like the fight of love against prohibition you know where it was considered a major like\nIf issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense to you out of this is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Canada's had medical marijuana since two thousand and one is very popular so too does not out on a limb by endorsing this so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week M. J. Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith this story involving energy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India oh is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks it has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nUh we've seen as all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and assaulted by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account\nBring um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism seeing ... and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protests of the ... temple and Carol estate the BBC's dreams Clinton was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no no no the media and it turns out to making this among them they don't really want to do the story goes up they wanted to say religion that's the only thing these\nSome of what the BBC's dreams Clinton was told in carelessly outside the ... temple there in ... I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this external pressure from the media and politician he wants to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says\nObviously that's not true let's I mean it's the most obvious part of that is that ... Modi who is the prime minister of India is from a fairly far right Hindu nationalist party so he's clearly not trying to destroy the culture and religion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "19"}
