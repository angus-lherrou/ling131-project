reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome\nThank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we the people had any idea what is actually contained within the four corners\nWell we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public a despite clearly a\nFair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among a chunk a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there\nOf what we do know is that publicly at least a six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim God that and Chris Garrett\nOr as well as one friend of of Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to

the leftist his rival Fernando ... died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including boss and arrows near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil in how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me up Bryan winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and power ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio Paolo thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you on her ... year to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is jai are both in our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAnd ... is a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades now\nI'm ... despite having sat in Congress for so much time and he he shows\nOpen loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists in\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure\nBut in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating a lot more with people\nWhen they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead an old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty\nWhat is Fernando ... what it is just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty to twenty fifty and this seemed like\nJust such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of West military rule from Nineteen sixty four\nIn Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our or even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people just both worlds Brian we're going to work on your Skype line a little bit of will will get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast is not as\nFiery as ... and our with correspondent has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around and say that drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stamped so the party at south now is very much hard left\nUm the candidate though is that um that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so\nA lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not do you see as president\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we're going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to the idea that voters know who they don't want the\nApollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally uh eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nOr one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we both are not winning more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are to laugh from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely fed up\nWith politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there's not going to be admitted there equal in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an hour oh has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers or the eaves\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally\nWhat happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil in a way I mean\nIt was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both so now he he almost\nBy his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him politically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because the plan by the more centrist candidates in this race\nAnd elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nPublic sympathy they really had to tone down or in some cases eliminate totally their attacks it's also allowed ... to stay fairly quiet and not articulate his plans what he would do if he gets elected as much as the otherwise would have had to I mean he either as a huge probably the biggest presidents\nThe con don't wait for the fun drive to start give now at ... dot org\nSupport for

[noise]\nWalking back to when I taught Zwick we're talking about the political climate in Brazil heading up to this weekend's presidential election what's happening in Brazil might seem familiar to Americans in the wake of the twenty sixteen us presidential elections\nMy guests are Monica to both senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics Brian winter is the editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the council the ... of the Americas\nAnd Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your messages won a listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... people are so fed up after the carwash scandal they will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party\nNow Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash in the broad offensive corruption scandal or is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but how old the will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in a car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred but let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context to things\nThe most important um findings have love as you had to or a car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen into was president at that time\nUm she was impeached in twenty six team\nAnd part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of hook of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash findings in the car wash\nIn terms of this particular investigation she was ... she didn't she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing\nUm but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because the the impeachment that\nShe suffered was really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had\nTo try to at least slow ... if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil because the people who still defend the workers' party instill defend the P. T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of or is that as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states up Paulo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nBut now terrible recession heritable corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country protests and to be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country ah one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers bar too far to the was led\nBy a man born in poverty a that to build this very successful ... own initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil\nA ... a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics big producer of commodities had the wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hit a\nA lot of that shot Duquesne and the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what they should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems\nThis crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that this whole thing should be positive is the fact that the states in Brazil he's basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from\nA ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what the how they plan to go from ...\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite\nNot enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion well if\nYou look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be on inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program feel like they're voting against\nSomebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences\nOf that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned Todd\nThe degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen this happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this corruption\nThan virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians\nThirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a and you know hard right turn earned it could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things I I and my time\nI'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile\nI guess just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military\nRule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little bit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now well\nBrian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilians say their representative democracy is the best form of government now I'm an right to the point ... emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus elect in Brazil\n... is another ... he's an air to wanna ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who were being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America\nAll of them are low for their corruption their narcissism and a total lack\nOf democracy and Paolo in the United states it's been said more than once that a ... is a Brazilian version a Brazilian analog of\nPresident Donald Trump they're both right wing they're both populists are these are these ... comparisons apps do you think\nI don't think so I think a President Trump is\n\nNinety gave us a lot Jurassic Park flannel jackets and of course the ... boys but was just a decade that sowed the seeds of political discontent

U. dot org we heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most divisive issues\nSince the civil war and we still have never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company\nDick suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today\nAnd nonpartisan Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do\nI Want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager he helped impeach Bill Clinton and then went before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the ... Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended Kavanaugh he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years\nYou've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow backing twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans had your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk if occasion in the Trump beer at say to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it\nTells me that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense they're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election there was as you remember the certainly the the Republicans ... ...\nAnd did that demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term they came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party is like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's what I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... more than ...\nMore than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of his party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he if he converted what's he think he I mean look\nThere's there there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons to Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there is also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing Donald Trump win the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans\nAnd what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last\nIs the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if when he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle\nI usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and and Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising\nTo you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting yeah at the main political science they those voters who go and they a Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about\nUh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could\nHave a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen who was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner's maker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house if you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run then I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it a back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at a well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah there there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play or you may say well what was the big deal the deal was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet for this you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nFor NPR comes from this station and from a Rhodes Scholar and not for profit offering learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at R.

is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the

a\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nMany ways we are a shining city on it\nFor the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory\nAnd the places that you don't visit\nAnd your shining city and believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill\nWell here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back to our send you a whole\n[noise]\n\nSoon\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to harm the Arsenio Hall show remember him for for ... before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talked about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus what Ross Perot second place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton in so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable\nHe'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li ... scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was\nTo to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with the traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just arson you Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point\nAnd and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls and Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent in just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteer submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that\nIn our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that when one after that was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing\nYou know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message um\nPoliticians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama\nHad a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public have\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich in that moment with a meal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN give CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late nights\nAnd how Gingrich or legal to build his career as rise in the house around that\nFast forward to Donald Trump or to Donald Trump do\nIt television obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties was CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there\nWell let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his had little oven I guess he's an anti Semite he doesn't like the black sea doesn't like the gays I I I it's just incredible that anybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch right wacko ... I'm not even sure if it's right\nIt's just a lack of of and I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously\nDonald Trump sounded than about ... you can and how John McCain sounded about Donald Trump\nJust a couple of years ago calling his voters wacko birds you know that you can and was a candidate who supported a moratorium on new regulations supported building a border wall even said and this is a quote from your book we're going to make America great again there's nothing wrong with putting America", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "04"}
