let me get to some of your stories in comments one member of the one eight text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and the freedoms of dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scene\nWhen I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so\nIf you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt in its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\nYou know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to just stay silent Ken my own experience\nCan you share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so and it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I had I had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and been interested in learning other and\nWhen you drink a lot as you had Twenty years old at the time on and he drank more that\nUm and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was a rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm often to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I saw at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked\nProfessor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter ... the uproar is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippie campuses and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDr Ford and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are evolved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away\nYou when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react\nLike the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but for get other details like\nUh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nIt kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way you describe that it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you walking through on that house you'll forget all the decor but that's the thing that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that great example yes\nNow more you said that a moment she's mia Lauren Lauren Taylor these moments that in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or do you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through those or ten\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a ... community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is\nHelp people find their voice and find their physical power\nA talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor Conan will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so magic\nUm release of that and so mad at basically means so much is body so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting\nAnd um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body you're not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nLeads to a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin\nShe emailed I'm Seventy two I told my best friend about her employees who sexually harassed me she asked me to show him my breasts while he stroked himself asked disgusting

love your help with tomorrow's program about the minimum wage this warning Amazon announced that it will raise its minimum wage for all its workers to Fifteen dollars an hour it's the latest move in these so called fight for Fifteen\nHow big a difference would earning Fifteen dollars an hour make for you if you are paid an hourly wage how did your rate get to where it is now and how well or poorly is it meeting your needs\nLeave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one day for that matter maybe Fifteen is not enough how much would you actually need to earn per hour to pay all your bills and live decently\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a where you can use our app won a vox pop singer so radio quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nName is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to knowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth which she wait thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why\nIt doesn't matter that we were victims\nWhen we are raped we feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves let alone to anyone else\nIf it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and\nReaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation embarrassment the comes after that incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault\nOr it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social research or you know that he's shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am in my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really\nWatching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of\nThe embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nI just wanted to um that speak to what this\nAll powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who make that choice not to tell\n'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emailed when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some worked I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant and I you'd be in me this went on for almost two years\nMore and let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for ... a sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd right now [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper Jeff Flake or or any ... to me how responsible for that responsible ... own kind that\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get his drunk 'cause we want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day it is difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug anyone and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters\nProfessor ... could you react to that I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how this might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because um [noise]\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nUm and um be hurt 'em so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford or did they feel like their experiences are being\nNeglected um I think if more men um\nWho were able to and felt comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to move the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from Matt Mel perpetrators but we also need to hear from our allies and met males to have had similar experiences I think that um\n\nSay there are no dumb questions Neil DeGrasse Tyson says that's true and he's answering your questions about first space and war\nFrom W.

combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the ... you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas at the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association\nBecause we just humbly said mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact\nAstrophysicist and then the earlier days are strong numbers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision\nAround the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have the conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military about the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which costs\nTrump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth ... since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of ... within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people enough humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space force is not a new concept and it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs there's consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus\nAnd other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nThe what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter]\n... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess [laughter] but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well might we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space worse separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nExcept as as I speak that was very we don't want to just be there we went to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will this mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than saying the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really referencing rhetoric not reality reality is a space for us what would that mean\nYou would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force and slide them out under one umbrella one sort of coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that\nUh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it that could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render us all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survivor ability right of of of the ... that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include ... by the way I Would also throw in your clean up the debris it's up there while you're asked the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace it's very hard and not particularly strategic to make space and act the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature today more than a hundred countries are son from Nineteen sixty seven that it's a peaceful use of outer space treaty has a much longer named and I always forget right those are those are the that those are the essence words from the title\nAnd it's very beautiful treat it you feel like holding hands and sing and ... as you read it particularly at a time when there's the Cold War but space activities weren't right on the rise it was a ... a really beauty\nFor NPR cameras from

women in America and what it's meant for the country what's your story\nHas there been times when you chose not to get mad or maybe you grew up being told never to lose your cool\nLeave us a voice

five to three six one a one a can also use our app wanting vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file we'll talk about women and this and other moments of anger tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Neil DeGrasse Tyson lots of good questions to get through let's see how many of these we can get through in the time that we have left Eli wrote on our Facebook page that she's a big fan of yours Eli writes\nI have a job interview at Goddard today the God of space flight center do you have any suggestions on how I can slam dunk this thing it's my dream to be able to work at NASA\n[laughter] [noise] I think in this kind of in the world of of\nUh exploring the frontier and not only a strong resume matters but uh inter personally enthusiasm ... I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and your\nYour your spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all partake in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I a robot body transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\n[noise] ah so first of the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions is also reduce some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing to put a human brain into a robotic chassis\nUm when you could program the robot attracts you to have almost anything you really\nBut to to put our consciousness I tell you I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it that's evidence that usually you don't know\nWhat it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books we got grabbing [laughter]\nWe're not still writing books on it ... it just the law yeah obey gravity [laughter] so um but it it sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of translating brain what I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a O. S. at least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm\nSorry the brain of an a or less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nThat this sounds very altered carbon even wants to a lot of Netflix Amazon\n[laughter] very Frankenstein to ... I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly helps though is on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is this there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some order and they analyze of water really carefully and say [noise]\nThey're no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy in our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next\nThe bigger it as the easier it is to detect so so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comet could come from out of nowhere ... comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but ... I regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding protecting have any insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over and nature and heed the warnings or scientist\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of guilt today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is\nThis I cannot tolerate any further on an e people I don't want to ... people are so rich that really is too hot [laughter] right right so you\nSo you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and this this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I'm ... I've seen people bounce back\nSocieties bounce back ... people in power bounce back so how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in and so that's why I think we'll be okay\nIncapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what the timeline to solving say something like\nDark matter the question Jared Neil ... so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether I was slightly rephrase that question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask and this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so ah now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders are those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we're assembling wrong by wrong a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted\nAnd so we were so maybe the sum of all the intelligence of all humans\nWhich has provided by peer reviewed journals that are publicly available as we all start where someone left off and take it further that as we ascend may be we can be smarter as a species that we can't as an individual", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "02"}
