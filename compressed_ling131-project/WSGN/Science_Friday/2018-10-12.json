Johnson is the author he's a theoretical physicist himself and he taught himself to draw\nThat's that's amazing to to to to create this beautiful book and we have some of these original sketches where the dialogues up at our website at science friday dot com slash physics Clifford is also professor of physics at the University of Southern California co director of the LA Institute for the humanities\nThey're welcome to science friday Dr Johnson especially to be here you're you're working physicist but you're taught yourself to draw to make this book it it looks like the work of a comic industry veteran\nThat's very kind of you uh yes I I I think it is sort of fits with with what we do\nNew technique so we just take the time out and then the techniques and do what I did\nIt over two hundred pages of all kinds of must be a thousand panels are more in their um yes how long did\nThat take to do well a bearing in mind that I have my my professor gig during the day as it was I was mostly doing this in my spare time except for the last\nSemester where I had a sabbatical semester and so I I started drawing on it seriously hum it around twenty ten was when I started trying to figure out whether I could draw for it right\nAnd then a a realized that it was it was possible and then over the years ah during spring break in between bits of research and what have you\nI did it until I finished in twenty sixteen\nAnd it's just amazing and end of the book is called the dialogues that dialogue in the graphic novel aspects I think to me reading it takes the scary part away from it\nAnd I was trying to come up with an analogy for what the book is like to read and I came up I was watching the film of Henry the fifth last night on TV you know it's one of my favorite Shakespeare plays\nAnd if I were just to read any Shakespeare is very hard to understand what's going on in the scene but if you graphic making it to a film or video and watch the actors they sort of bring to life between the words\nThank you I also want to thank Bruce and Pamela Green from Reno whose they say they enjoy the balance of information that that WHM provides really with real news and real

them before it was just crazy feeling of ... seeing people that I knew really well and I never met was very disorienting day my first day but I was a big listener before I came I Love the the\nFor me I like to get information through my ears and some people like to read it some people like to watch it I like to hear\nAnd these people spoke in a thoughtful sophisticated intelligent comprehensive way and I listened and it was interesting and I was interested in I was learning something\nA year learning something every day when you listen to W. B. a gem when you listen to programs to science friday and all things considered how much is that worth you how much of his love of lifelong learning worth to you how much is driveway moment where do you where where you're sitting in the car with your key in the accessory position and listening to the store you can get out of the guard\nThat happens because the programming is is is different the programming sounds different because of your support eight hundred for for for nine two four six make your investment right now your investment in quality programming eight hundred\nFor for for nine two four six era we have a ten contributions to go I think we're going to make it the hours kind of still almost halfway through but I think we're going to make it I Believe in Birmingham Michael okay [laughter] no true or words have been\nTwo four six or W. B. H M dot org thanks for listening and thanks for your support of public radio [noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we are talking about physics this hour in a specially bad to\nBlack holes will get into all kinds of uh cosmology here are are with me as Clipper Johnson author of the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe\nIt's just wonderfully done I'm thinking what I was really struck about was you had panels in the air that had no conversation there was no dialogue gets like this is where you think you want you on the characters just sitting and thinking about what they just sat\nYes I I I also like to celebrate um silence or as a ... a breathing space or ... or ... visually in comics I think is a really wonderful thing there's always a danger that people will just sort of skip through those ... to look for the for the speech bubbles but\nBut I I Hope that um some people will will appreciate that I'm ... I'm trying to give you\nA time for yourself to think and maybe the characters are thinking well maybe the whole story is sort of working up to this dialogue and as he's quiet ... that it's nice to actually go through slowly or in anticipation of the conversation\n... ... it's good that it's written because we can look back on the panels in the dark or equations in there some famous equation in there and then you know I\nHave new I found new meaning in them in in ... from what you've written a one of the scientists are in the book makes the point that you can have a simple elegant underlying theory and yet still have lots of solutions to the equations that defined it in China so it's not so simple\nMore elegant and for that is true right\nI mean this has happened on string theory where there's a proliferation of solutions and eh what one sort of hopes were as a scientist is that there's a prediction for one for one being singled out and um and so we find ourselves in his unusual position where this\nThis theory which may may be the one that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity and explains the black hole and explains hawking evaporation and explains how much is not singling out a specific solution\nTrent permutations of the laws of physics and we're grappling with that\nAnd people are in in the book the characters in the book or saying maybe we need new physics\nOr wherever or string theory is wrong and physics\nAnd and and and just and it gets to a question I ask a lot when I ... I Can't understand all the mathematics and uh I Can't understand twelve dimensions whatever um he's maybe the math really doesn't describe reality even though we works\nI mean yeah you know I I it it's an interesting question because mathematicians are way ahead of us and inventing mathematics that they don't foresee will have application in physics [noise] um the mathematics that Einstein used existed beforehand and he found an application for it by understanding it could represent curved space time\nIs it possible that all the mathematics always has a representation in physical reality I mean these are profound questions or are simple things like irrational numbers simply not part of reality\nYes it is actually a there was one of the stories uh starts out with that discussion which is well do you actually well it comes up in the discussion which is it do we invent mathematics or did we discover it\nAnd depending upon which position you take it it does say something about the the whole business of research in theoretical physics or these wonderful things we make up um\nSometimes they could just end up being wrong or maybe they'll have applications we just haven't thought of yet string theory may turn out to be wrong for the things we\nUh started applying it full but maybe it'll have applications in some other piece of physics one day a and so on and so forth is it's very interesting\nWhen does when does an idea I mean you lose its validity if we don't have a test for like string theory we can't test and then you talk about in in the ... when you get\nWell I think that that's actually something we just have to accept that are tests might not catch up with our ideas in a human lifespan\nBut that doesn't mean that the ideas have failed when we prove that something can be proven that's a whole other level than like proof that things can't be proven we're nowhere near that there is an absolutely no proof that string theory can't be proven and I think that as long as it remains possible we have to allow\nFor the great ideas to calm and maybe they won't come and the next five ten years maybe they'll come at a hundred and that's that's just something we have to accept\nWhat it is it's important to remember the uh since this already very pragmatic and this goes back to the whole business of what sites\nYou I'm In best shape for doing what we think we're trying to do with unifying the you know [noise]\nCorner mechanics and gravity and things like that but if something better came along\nWe're busy but if you do a sustaining membership ... your membership is always up to date and we appreciate that very much it's very cost effective for both you and us eight hundred for for for nine two four six ask our volunteer about a sustaining membership or W.

I mean you you collect\nWhat is the the ... is a term\nThat we have always used at the museum and the ... lab where we scan birds and we have a lot of bird egg laying on the table\nAnd so when we started working on a bird strike a dentist vacations that was sort of a natural word to use and for that race it spurred Eric ... so its forensic what is on and it is in a way I mean it's not\nTechnically forensic because we don't do law enforcement cases but we do use forensic techniques and so we look at the trace evidence we look at the microscopic characters\nThe DNA the circumstantial evidence to solve our puzzle which is ultimately the identification of the species of bird\nIf you're going to identify them then you must keep samples of birds match with how many how many birds are in your collection well actually we\nAre located right upstairs in the national museum of natural history at the Smithsonian or and and the bird division and the bird division was founded way before there were ever airplanes flying and so we are just a user of that huge collection there but that is our resource in our research collection so we\nHave somewhere around six hundred and twenty thousand museum specimens up there and their drawers how we represent about eighty five percent of the diversity of birds of the world and so it is an ideal place to conduct this kind of research\nSo how many how many birds actually get hit by planes or vice versa yeah [laughter] that's right the birds are actually flying into the planes it's not their fault 'em\nBut we you know every year\nOur lab identifies over nine thousand cases and you mentioned at the beginning and they show that we do about twenty four hundred in spring migration but totally\nFor the year it's over nine thousand uh samples that we received now we don't receive all of the samples so there are somewhere around Thirteen thousand bird strikes report it to civil aviation and another four to five thousand from the military so it's quite a quite a few birds every year\nSo picks up the sample sample get to you it's taking some time but we've got people\nIn the field now um the military has a a bird aircraft strike has her team though I Will pick up the\nAnd so how often do you have a completely unsolved mysteries you know a lot of times\nNo not really [laughter] we have great tools to do the work so we have DNA and we have microscope analysis and we also use whole feathers\nHouses how small piece of feather do you need\n... well we sometimes we can do it with a single or just a single barb from the fluffy part of the feather and that's the the base has a feather or the part of the feather that is responsible for insulation and keeping the bird warm and that's where the the real diagnostic characters are located so we need that part but we don't need very much\nIf somebody's send you some large and you analyze it the ever say hey this isn't a bird I got so they somebody sent me something\nWhat is it well if we get that somebody is going to get an earful [laughter] because we uh you know we are very serious about what we do we don't want people sending his jokes but uh we do get things that are interesting that that are valid tell me like fish and\nYeah and and deer and I'd say wait a minute of backup edited dear good on a plane [laughter] I don't buy it and we we do get snakes too [laughter]\nUm how well the interesting thing isn't it all turns out to be pretty\nMuch the same story is it's usually a a bird was either feeding on that animal or or the bird was carrying it in its talents and it just you know when it hits the plane everything goes everywhere and that's the part of the sample that we receive and so it yeah\nIt's an interesting interesting I I Know that your team worked on the aftermath of that crash that led to the so called miracle on the Hudson and a plane that landed in the river was it any mystery that the plane had hit these though I mean\nWell that's a good question because they did the pilot I think reported yeah these are and they did think that's what it was right initially in the very beginning of the investigation\nMichael I think we're going to pull it out here you had asked made Fifteen how great how great that's wonderful so thanks to everyone that maybe they should have a new\nHour we will have a new goal that's just how this works right these are the interim kind of little baby steps we need to get to the big\nTop of their staircase actually Fifteen donations toward our larger call and have four hundred thousand\nThanks to everyone who's made a contribution if you haven't yet there's still plenty of room eight hundred for for for nine two four six or W.

B. H M dot org hello I'm ... I'm Ryan I'm rubber quote\nIt is how often do you do this you head out to the store where's the soy milk as big of a couple of things to\nGet that and this has been good in the ... I shot to again and yes you do it in ...\nRaman blue asking the state we suggest instead of impulse buying that stuff you don't need that stuff ... both by us\nYeah I mean after all this is public radio and I don't go about this call the number line\n[laughter] here's how hundred for for for nine two four six WB H M dot org impulse buy WBAI I like\nI liked that idea that this impulse buy right now you're listening to us in the car don't drive safely don't don't don't do anything rash but once you get home or you can pull over or give us a call or go to W. B. hmm dot org and and make your donation the number to call one eight hundred for for for\nAnd we need to hear from you now because we want to supply you with the kind of programming that you come to expect\nYou listen to W. B. ... WHM is supported by listeners nearly half of our budget comes from your individual contributions pleased donate now that's how it works here at W. B. a gym we we take the money that listeners like you'd donate and we pull it together and we pay for the programming the programs that you enjoy\nExactly right to you know science friday's talking about pretty high math this is pretty simple math\nYour ... your donation your donation helps us pay ... pay for everything that happens here WB H M and it helps us pay for the programming we get from NPR from other providers\nPrograms like science friday come to you because you are someone before you stepped up in contributed to WB H M so we're talking to you and we're talking to you now listeners we love our listeners they are so important to us but membership membership and WBAI Jim is essential\nEleven eleven contributions to go this hour to keep us on track you can do it on line at W. beecham dot org or go to our Web or call the eight hundred for for for nine two four six thanks for listening\nThank you for your support of public radio for Birmingham and the heart of Alabama [noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking this hour about mathematics and then it has sparked some great interest in our listeners let me quickly go through our guests Rebecca golden Eugene Chang Emily real or professional professional mathematicians paid for that instead of just doing the crossword puzzle\nUm let's go to the phones let's go to the first call from Bruce in Huntsville, Alabama Hi Bruce\nHello hello Hi there my question is do mathematics exist without human beings are consciousness to um to think of them\nAre getting about philosophy there's mathematics exist without\nPeople that he has his well I think I think I like Rebecca said some mathematicians think they invent math and some people think they discover it what I think is that I discovered a mathematical concept and I invent language for thinking about it\nSo the philosophical question become do thoughts exist you concept you why does exist without humans existing I think that the language that we invent\nThose ideas do they exist without this I don't know\nOh ... ... ...\n... let me see for Rebecca ... only wants to chime in on her\nYou know I think one thing that I'm appreciating as I get further on in my career as a how important a community is a human communities are to the mathematics that's being developed so it's a sort of very charismatic a lecture or a good ... can have a huge influence over field by\nMaking other young mathematicians excited and dry and people in and so then a lot of energy happens focusing on particular problem some questions and you could very easily imagine the development having been different\nLet's go to a home or in woodland California Homer welcome to science friday\nHello thank you for taking my call 'em as any license birth\nAnd one of your guest was talking about uh if you have a big imagination you can pretty much do anything and left me that's why I decided to call them ...\nYou know and I I'm I'm attempting to write a book you know I'm I'm five five enthusiasts [noise] mhm so um when you mentioned hardly mentioned just about the kid who travels so hard to measure than basically I'm just using my own imagination\nSo I'm wonderful I don't know what to base it on as far as I Know a third dimension of life with an ... foot fourth dimension I heard his time I don't know if that's true or not but then where do you go from there I mean what can we owe about higher diminishing or what what we can do so\nAll right let's see if we get some hints for a good good luck Homer\nThat those are great questions and I should add that there are in fact blind to mathematicians so it's a it's certainly not impossible to do very high level mathematics or if you're blind\nThere's um there there as far as looking at higher dimensions one always think about it I mean a lot of people like to think of space and time as having those being those four dimensions that we can think about but\nAnytime you keep track of a bunch of things here really dealing in high dimension so if I wanted to keep track of\nA People's hair color and their eye color and their\nAddress and some other information or that I'm really maybe their income and also their phone number at that would be the kind of thing that maybe a wheelchair realty people are interested in keeps track that kind of information and that's already a bunch of dimensions one dimension for each piece of information that you carry about somebody\nI'm so there's a kind of way in which ah what mathematics does dimension is really just keep track of\nOh hi dimensions have been in the news in physics which takes mathematicians to figure it out for ... for them um and especially string theory talking about hide the big dimensions are many we're talking about twelve a dozen or more I ... do you understand what's going on there because they're all dimensional mathematician\nThat's sort of a joke in an infinite dimensional ... theory that once you will be on three it basically might as well be insanity [laughter] so difficult to be on that one is three in fantasy [laughter] it's it just to understand\nBut it's a great question when you say do we really understand it and I think one reason that many people have put off math\nIs it that they think they don't understand it but none of us really understand that honestly we were just trying to understand it more all the time and being confused doesn't mean that we're not good at and I think a lot of people who puts off because they they feel confused and they go oh I'm no good at math\nBut actually being confused and caring about it is what matters often the people who think they understand it they really don't\nAnd I might just say quickly add one practical suggestion one way to a matching what's a four or five dimensions might look like from the perspective of three dimensions is to imagine what a three dimensions would look like from the perspective of one or two\nDimensions I'm so this is essentially the move that Edwin Abbott makes in his book flat land which is a wonderful novel yeah\nAnother way to imagine escaping so you can ... you can escape someone who's chasing you in three dimensions by time traveling and then you can escape someone if they have a time traveling machine as well then you can imagine machine could you use to escape that person that would be the fifth dimension\nI have a tweet coming in from Dylan who touches on something that really bugs me and that is could you ask your experts what is the utility of zero now when I watch baseball scores a big baseball fan and I watch the scores it all the time [noise]\nUm I ask a zero was a number of people do not you you know they they say we're at the bottom of the ... there is no score of course there is a score zero zero right as it is it and he says it odd for me that uh we have a representation representation of nothing\nZero has been a big problem and map for for centuries heaven\nYou know there was actually a very long history between when they thought of numbers and when they came up with zero and then we would like to think about zero with you there really isn't that interesting but you really miss it if it was gone and I tell my students that it's just like some people that are very interesting but they can be really important sometimes the boring people\nNine contributions to go nine contributions to go to keep us on track during this hour eight hundred for for for nine two four six or W. B. H M dot org\nHey this is Jed from radiolab public radio embraces complexity right we love stories that challenge our assumptions make us see things from multiple angles and we had a front row of view of that on radiolab when we spoke with a mother\nWho is really struggling with their sons choice of sports I I stand firm on both sides of the debate\n[laughter] I Know that may vary\nI also stand for him that children should play football that it's a great sport\nFleet is like the world is complicated rights it's not simple and yet so many media outlets try and paint stories as black or white or your local public radio station is bucking that approach and that's just one of the ways that public radio does things differently another is how\nWe fund public radio listener funding is the single most reliable way that we do this so your sustaining gift right now makes this kind of programming possible keep your station healthy keeping vital by making a sustaining gift right now\nOh and that uh that mom that football loving mom\nOr she did find a way to thread the needle\nHer current solution can be a kicker [laughter]\nEight hundred for for for nine two four six don't punt the ball that you know don't don't comfortable going to make your contribution right now don't punch for someone else to do it for someone else to do it you do it you value the programming you know it's unique a eight hundred for for for nine two four six\nWe've got this many goal this hour we want to hit we want to stay on track\nFifteen donations we've got nine guys\nTo go until we get to the top of the hour we can do it with your help one eight hundred for for for nine two four six is the number to call\n'em look we know that there are plenty of listeners out there who who listen to the w._b. H M but don't contribute we had a hundred and ten thousand listeners a week I'm only about ten percent of those people give money to WBAI Jim I'm be one of those people who stand up\nAnd support the thing you'd love and use\nWBAI Jim as a public service unlike any other radio station in town were noncommercial nonprofit we depend on listeners to fuel us and make a strong one eight hundred for for for nine two four six are staffers and volunteers are back there and they're waiting to take your call there waiting to hear from you\nAnd if you can become a sustaining member that's how you support the station year round it's a monthly charge on your credit or debit card it's really easy to set up our most popular giving level in fact is ten dollars a month on a sustaining membership or we've had lots of people do that\nAnd it's great because ... ... people are busy I'm busy lives I cannot I've taken calls this morning so it was like yeah I gave I gave last year and and like no they haven't given for like three years actually and it's not because they purposely haven't wanted to give it just you forget about it you've got other things to do your sustaining membership is\nNeed to just by by letting us know but the sustaining membership is is a great way to support the station on an ongoing basis and it's a good\nMoment Michael ... thank all of those staying members\nOf WB H M and to think especially the standing members who have stepped up yet again during this Dr during this week and given us just a little bit more they know that we're trying to reach this goal trying to do more for Birmingham in Alabama in terms of the programming we provide in in addition to the monthly charge on their credit card\nThey'd given a little bit more if you can give a little bit more or give a little bit for the first time we want to hear from you one eight hundred for for for nine two four six\nI've taken a two types of standing member calls want us as like you know what I give ten dollars a month on raise that to Fifteen dollars rise and we're happy to do to do that as well\nAnd like you said Chuck I've ... I've said some of the you know I'm a sustaining number I'm giving a little more now I Want to help you meet this also uh of course if you've never given to public radio and you're new to public radio you're wondering like what is this what is going on here this is how the business model works we trust you you are going to do the right thing and make a contribution\nTo the radio station you listen to more than any other because the programming is unique that's our business model we count on listeners for our funding half our budget comes from you\nMake that call right now eight hundred for for for nine two four six take that first step and transform yourself from a listener to a member nine contributions to go ... about a\nFifteen minutes to the top of the hour we want to hear from nine donors out there who will call now or go to the website now and give to this radio station and keep public radio strong in the heart of Alabama\nEight hundred for for for nine two four six and when you give thank you [noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow I Want you to listen to his sound and guess what it is\nBad\nYou know it does sound like a heartbeat but it is not it is the seismic sound of an elephant walking the vibrations in the earth let me play it again\nBack\nThat African elephant is the largest land animals still alive today and more importantly for this story they are the heaviest they way up to two tons so it might not surprise you to learn that we can listen to them and the shaking of the ground earthquake monitoring tools are capable not just\nOh ... what kind of behavior is being hurt whether the elephant is walking quickly or even just roaring and the researchers speculate perhaps this information\nCould help us monitor elephants at risk of poaching among other conservation effort to to talk with me about that is a bit more than ... research fellow in the department of zoology and University of Oxford in UK welcome Beth\nHi thanks for having me on the show\nAnd ... associate professor of geophysics also at the University of Oxford welcome a tire yang thanks very much for me you are welcome are bad for what sent you looking for elephants seismology in the first place\nSay I'm interested in animals these vibrations through materials intonation say send us my previous reset ... spiders and how the vibration tree despite a Web\nSay I have obviously let's get the other end of the size spectrum but for the sense that spider Web is basically the savannah terrain say is interested in what the role that physical environment place on how they can use these vibrations insemination\nTo change a tire you have you ever tried to measure the size of the logical signal of an animal before\n[noise] no certainly not consciously sold certainly some sort of lead to [laughter]\nTo deliberately no I'm seismic instruments essentially measure anything you could imagine but um [noise]\nBut in this study what we really tried to do is is a focus on this a memo behavior describe the equipment to use and how you set it up and it works the recording of of vibrations works very much like what we're doing right now it's a talking to a microphone so we just sort of put the year to the ground and and listen through the waves as to propagate through the substrates\nSo wherever the source comes from cooking earthquake could be okay no an impact to a nuclear bomb or in this case an animal\nIs uh the the art and science of success multitude to disentangle the vibration in terms of where it comes from\nI Want to play the sound one more time and then I Want to ask both of you to sort of dissect it for me let's take one more longer listen\nDum de\n... it sounds to me either like a heartbeat or a motorboat underwater\nYeah say ... what we did to January they would check place using that she is saying which measures the vibration through the ground and basically January ... is that\nTo increase the frequency city the actual pitch is that she got a lot to think like really low base that you can feel rather than here and then I also had she amplify the recording as well say uh it's modified from its original\nForm that you can imagine it's the same techniques that you would you used to record say out of voices right now\nAnd that was one single elephant we were listening to\nThat was one elephant a walking past a which was recorded in the field in Kenya\nNow you find that the signals can travel three or even six kilometers was set up to five miles away from the elephant itself is is is this something a human could feel just standing there\nHumans do you have a sense of vibration I Would not fairly good at using it they say it's a lot better cheese these types of edgy phones\nAnd then she uh use a census itself but it it doesn't mean that humans can be taught to use these types of vibrations intensive the long distance scale that you're talking about that\nWhat we're able to do with these recordings it's basically got an idea for how much force the adolescent at which generating I'm we put\nThese into the computer models\nSay that's a ... kind of six kilometers was using computer models ... favorable conditions so by that I mean kind of known noise and on a Sunday to rein these high full ... is that just walking around could be be able to detect and be able to discriminate up to that kind of range", "show_name":
