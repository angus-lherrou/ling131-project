I'm a chemistry part prize was split with two other researchers right Stuart Smith and Gregory Winter ... and what what did they win for\nSo they both work on a this technique called phage display which harnesses bacteria phages there are viruses that infect bacteria\nUm and it's kind of us the similar principle where you're taking advantage of these living systems to produce useful molecules proteins and antibodies that have all kinds of biological and medical applications ... and what about physics\nSo in physics the prize was awarded to three researchers who work with lasers a pretty cool [laughter] I'm Arthur Ashe skin dried Murrow and John Strickland 'em and they basically not just use lasers but use lasers as tools so asking um develop this technique called optical tweezers where he basically\nFigured out that when you point a laser this focused beam of light atmosphere ... object to the object is actually drawn towards the center of the beam and you can use that to manipulate\nThings as teeny as particles or as big as bacterial cells or seen the ...\nWork on that large of the laser pretty focused but um it's fun to think\nAbout ... and ... after winning the dumbest trickle of explained what amazed her most about the research\nI think quite late generation is one of these remarkable things one color like water any clear anything at all the color was short and and it's just remarkable that there were two oldest colored\nShades of Isaac Newton\nYeah and it was cool hearing that Strickland actually mentioned that she um uses white general ... light generation when she teaches introductory physics courses so that's something that anyone can appreciate you don't need to be a Nobel laureate to see this really cool\nPhenomenon heartless move onto physiology or medicine\nSo the award for medicine went to two researchers James Allison ... for their work on um you know therapy um this is basically a treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight against cancer\nAnd both researchers discovered proteins that act as breaks on the immune system\nI'm Ira Flatow and you're listening to science friday we're talking with Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twenty the Nobel Prize in\nChemistry I'm\n... years a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were very proud of engineer\nAre you not I am tell us what the differences well I Love\nTo build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talk about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] years it's really amazing has changed so much in the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you're saying that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of ... almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edit it but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells that all\n... and so uh where do you bring truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make\nTheir ... agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n... my son you talked to said I have fun for us we molecules to have sex\nOh yes [laughter] I Do [laughter] [laughter] well if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around\nIf you read combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dieting coach something novel\n... she would get a call phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ... Adrian and Hamdan I imagine\nThere who are non unharmed on um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your\nThoughts on the subject how to identify your kids or younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to well I\nWas lucky my father is the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls to do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to ...\nOr somebody could even be their parents who kept him or good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age who was talented in science\nI think all children are talented ... and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone ...\nHave a tweet from ... says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury thing\n[laughter] I Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty and dogs are so many interesting behaviors\nOr they can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details of that are\nAs we sequence more things and under ... and measure their properties will be using in Portland and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to pull out what is that genetic basis\nWhile you weren't you don't pay that my my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I'll give you while you've got some money now from the Nobel Prize or what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have\n... powerful enough tools to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use AI machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that one of your great ambitions is to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards ...

thank you doctor for taking time to be with us today thank you Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the twentieth the Nobel Prize in ...\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious dues individual political races Ken we're bitter conversations about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic logic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to\nOur guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and um [noise]\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are funding in and first one Alex's from Chicago hey neighbor\n[noise] hey there you go ahead so off\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know out as\nA black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes to suicide you stick systems unknowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as a feminist\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine system and so I'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing feminist um and identifying myself in such a way really changed my mind\nI'm In law I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nHe's you know as part of the problem is that we don't see how we are there see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend two don't try to defend our end points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of\nUsing some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences so in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience [laughter]\nThe empathy is caring enough to respect the view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way parts of math and\nThese things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects that bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some some er current events or let's turn out to the artist topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault a good a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write that in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process is at play and tell me what you mean by that\nThat's a whole are there are a whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about wrong definitions because all of the people who claimed to the principle of the presumption of innocence and the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to presume ... someone innocent until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused personnel let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man\nThen what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man I'm the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and cello Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time I studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of presuming the accused persons\nWith some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and go well what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen and does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we're somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next problem is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but said on his book that that we are characterizing just spin the both will crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale and there are things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of\nIt while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying or your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind justify accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nI'm finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a little while you have to decide what you'll default position is and then say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very sure that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court appointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important\nAnd so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good and important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\nBe we should nuke we should not punish somebody if there is some doubts about whether they should be punished which means if there is something something good to offset the are showing us about the fact that they are bad\nAnd those are two they sound the same but that's slightly different situations that have a different now ... situation [noise]\nThey'd for for seven to forward to four or five lots of people are checking in on that let's go to a career in Washington state Hi welcome to science friday\n[noise]\nMilk doused with formaldehyde bar acts filled

climb aboard ducked decrease Dr Christina ... is assistant research scientist in the department of biology\nAt Indiana University in Bloomington bulk up to science friday Hi Ira\nSo tell me about these ride sharing arrangements between the dung beetle and unable to do that to be to organisms interact\nGladly um well when the dung beetle is ready to reproduce they a tunnel underneath a done Patty and they create these developmental chambers out and done that we call it breed ball and in each of those ... balls they place a single egg\nAnd from being an egg to an adult beat all of that that developing beat all depends on this developmental chamber for its nutrients that for a shelter and protection and uh none of toads right along on these beetles they're they're small worms\nAnd um they end up in these developmental chambers along with the developing beetles and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um\nThat this association existed and so this is something that we wanted to investigate more to understand the consequences of that interaction for\nTell me tell me what did you learn\nWell um [laughter] we looked at all in all different parts of the Beatles ... and we found them on various parts but we're particularly interested in is really high concentration of nematodes it's found on the genitalia um it's a good place for ... to hide but also it's a really\nCompelling a venue for getting to the next generation because it's involved and reproduction\nAnd so what we found was not only are are these ... passed between males and females but they're also passed off to the offspring and the offspring that develop alongside these nematodes actually a grow faster and larger than their counterparts um that don't have the is on the toads\nAny conditions that we tested we didn't find that that the number two it was actually bad for the developing beetle I'm In the the conditions under which we tested those we always found that it was a good thing to have it along so it's more of a mutual is really\nYeah I was wondering about but usually a parasite or something and it sucks away the life of with your toast right but this was not what's happening you\nKnow and that was um nematodes are are almost infamous for being parasites they're parasites of humans have cattle plants\nI'm In a lot of our attention is directed towards that sort of negative interaction um but less investigated his ways in which they can be either neutral or even beneficial to their hosts\nThis ... science friday I'm Ira Flatow and the past few years the field ... exoplanet discovery has really taken off instruments like Kepler and the newer tests had been racking up the planet count\nBut this week astronomers writing and the journal science advances\n... the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have been ... exoplanet but ... moon orbiting and exoplanet to be specific\n... sixteen dash twenty five dash B. and his some four thousand light years away how did he do that well gentlemen ... talk about the research is Alex teaching ... and and ... graduate research fellow and the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome ... science friday\nThat you very much for having the first one ... the moon is just wherever they gave us a little thumbnail description\nSure yeah so it's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there\nAre a large moon about ... Neptune actually which is sort of strange um or putting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five B. and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can to\nSo so what is the relationship with the size of them went to the size of the plant\nSo the size of the planet is ah about the same size ... Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is uh like you say about the size and the mass of net\nPlay them that I'm pretty unusual well known that big well it's certainly unexpected right where if\nYou look at the moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are there all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said uh you know this is what it looks like about the size ... tune\nThat ... sort of a raises new questions for people ... how do you get something ... that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this was potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know ... because it is so large uh it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see so large\nYou know because when you think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a piece of it right it doesn't look like that and this case\nPacker scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus and then finally a capture scenario like a nap tunes largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ... belt\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nSure yes I Will uh there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the store like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks out some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see\nThe gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it is it orbits the star and so\nSometimes I planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them and\nThey insist on that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right well what did they say out loud\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and is the famous thing goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to rule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planet in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making and wobble around a those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative\nIncredible claim or it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nWell it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this naturally very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about\nThis very sure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth\nSo you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that are that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an excellent point it's going to be\nLike why yeah if it had been spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine how people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go around so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the mirror is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly more of the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know there are downsides officer now there isn't\nA matter of obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else that makes some law well I mean we should have made it twice as big we've had whatever I Am sure yeah you know so there's other\nThe a telescope called blue war than a new ... yeah that's a\nUh I I don't know who's working on it that it's it's a ultraviolet and read an optical that's L. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh that they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instrument stadium Estee will definitely be an an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is All right so if this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planets situation\nThat's a great question one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come with the question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here\nHappened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here and that of course speaks directly to\nThe question about the origin of life for example ah so it's particularly since this a moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this it's opening up the new questions about the dynamic will histories of these uh a planetary systems and and the speaks\nDirectly to that and the more exoplanets you discover that with thousands of them yeah there about four thousand confirmed plants I think at this point in the more questions you're going to open rather get answers fast well\nYou know that that's a good enough number and did that and we're now really filling in some nice statistics but there have been surprises along the way we found these things called hot Jupiter is you know plant it's about the size of Jupiter but very very close to their star nobody\nReally expected to see these things at all and even twenty some years after their first discovery or the theaters are still debating how you how you make these things\nI saw a story today just in passing I don't have any details about a new exoplanets too big you shouldn't be as big as insurance to write it sure it in a\nThis\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book the poison squad one came a single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for\nEight to five five I'm let's turn that the the clock back to that time period Deborah or you have an entire chapter on ketchup\n[laughter] what was so and then to that ... why you're devoted a well I read it I Know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up\n[noise] so\nThis very twenty first idea scrawny for a century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based kind about but in the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of thin nasty\nA sauce with a lot of vegetable ways to end that people would put pumpkin runs people would put tomatoes but they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called tar dies and then because the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dump preservatives it's in a like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... because it's this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz and he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the bacterial count down\nAnd then he really went to war a mean this was a\nBattle between business and advocates and and got business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer and profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent his or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nI Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nPlus you know there was a major combat over the preservatives and get to her and that was pretty fascinated\nUs let's talk about a Harvey Washington where I was a little bit more the focus of your book in the ... squad um\nHe actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that what is one of the ... you have to ... it's just crazy\nYou I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control but what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years\nNot able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things in the human beings\nAnd so that's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment\nIn which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was\nThey wouldn't eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison ... squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at cell of silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you are food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hymns wanted you know create this poisonous ... gets to the bottom of the food safety\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller ... he and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also in like ten or a preacher\nOn the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely really I mean what was interesting about him was that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just\nThat risk before the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on ...\n[laughter] they can take a drink of water out aren't [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kind of how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the\nThing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person who drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually we're in we're in our laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling always stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection law\nEver passed by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that\nIt for what he accomplished but and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died before it was created\nOr you know you were said though that you disagree with some of his of his tactics [noise]\nYou know he was as I say kind of a holy roller and he became very rigid I think some of that was that he was under attack constant attack both in government and out of it for Thirty years and he kind of awesome five to some extent and a perpetual defensive position\nBut also he he just\nHe couldn't bend on even the little details so he would like spend his political capital this is my personal opinion\nI'm sure it appreciate it [laughter] as a second guess them a hundred years later [laughter] you would like obsessed about you've made of vinegar and it's a fake vinegar and you should not be allowed to even put\nThe image of a grape leaves on your label but can somehow that my main one thing that you really grapes and so he would spend a lot of capital on these very tiny details", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city":
