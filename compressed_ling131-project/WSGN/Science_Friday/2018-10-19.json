change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by two degrees Celsius might look like then on the heels of that report Exxon Mobil announced that it was throwing financial support behind\nA U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled here with the story as well as other short subjects in science is ... are fun a staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on a service that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nProposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker\nThis is a group called the climate leadership council\nAnd proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise over time then they would use that money to go back to people like you and me essentially in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimate is that what started about two thousand dollars a year for a family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon wants ... rolled back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related law suits that one day\nOh it gets to what they got and it's what other industries have also tried to get\nA has a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been ahead of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped author the PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels ... years ago in in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers\nSaying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nYou know ... make us look good sort of thing\nThat's always the question isn't it I mean the thing to remember what Exxon is that they are an investor owned company so they do have to answer to their shareholders and they've been getting a lot of pressure and shareholder meetings to better address climate change also climate change poses a business risk for them um in terms of their facilities and\nIf they aren't out ahead on this they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor\nAnd another way of carbon tax might actually benefit them is that it would target the dirtier fuels first things like coal which would clear some space for one of axons other products natural gas\nAnd of course the catches the things they want an exchange for getting the other environmental regulations rolled back and the immunity from lawsuits I mean those are all things that benefit the company so you know this could be viewed as an act of self interest overall\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this the worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent in the past\nFifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rates globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number a four four seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us at ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that a Lancet Siri she's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries and overall there is a rising C section rates can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overuse C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it\nOf surgery is enormous his um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure\nAnd in countries such as in Africa that um don't have enough access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way over\nWas talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's an accepted norm of this part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise]\nAnd again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... is his area and is not a low risk of surgery it is it's a major surgery ends and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of pie\nSome places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nWhy they're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to to stay at at the ... there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan is the\nVice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics\nAnd gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ...\nThank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um ... there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise and sit there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that\nWho's responsible um it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that my country\nIshaan I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on the brink delivery unit that might put some pressure on them to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision I'm as not to ... to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do see a\n... a highly what's your reaction to them\nAnd why would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a badge and birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved imagine a burst\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday\nHi Ira thank you You're welcome good [noise] um\nI actually had an emergency C section at thirty one leave 'em and I went to prison for that\nFor that bill me [noise] um but when I got pregnant for a second time I really wasn't given the option of having that occurred after the sex and um I kind of had to do all that um education investigation\nOn my ... so I had to look at me but I I had to look at rates what were the very end mighty future pregnancies and um it really was up to me it was um like my provider all they want to have a repeat at the time I was like oh\nSure I have read that but I was that get then that risk and benefits of those people to make at truly educated\nDecision um and so I think that um I was able to\nActually win that Senate repeat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and my God I really ... them with that and I was able to have you back but I feel like there was a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had this ... okay in a lot of the information was\nVery emotional and it was really hard to find the facts\nAren't learning ... let me get let me get her that's great great\nBut should [laughter] and I'm Wondering through you back in the day everybody\nHad to add one section after another and voter was sort of saying you know I didn't know that maybe I didn't have to have\nAccess to the back or a vegetable birth actresses area and is going to be is one of the critical interventions that we all as a health care community are going to have to embrace and need to embrace in terms of lowering the overall sit there and delivery rate\nEight hundred for for for nine two four\nSix this is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we been talking this hour about the increase in the ...\n... school of nursing or Tony go and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get there but let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach here compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell in in it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out the W. World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp on us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have\nA collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a associated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of bursts are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type steady\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their mid why the midwife knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nTony going you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine\nProblem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area in a first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are and labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heart rate monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use fetal heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather then subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definitions for progress in labor a old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor then newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and I would do if you were only from so blown down here in Boston and so there's this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section ...\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on scissor and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm\nHas to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery ... did you study that your your your report how it\nWill ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more per se is Erin to really\nUm level the playing field in in ... in addition to liability reform um many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIn in time or perceived to be in time\n... ... you're you're ...\nIssue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than a scenario and delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S [noise] uh the reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay\nLet's go to Sharon in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications throw a chronic disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and\nUm I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just asked if he could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nKind of questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's\nWell our hearing these discussions and I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um and different direction slides I'd love to hear the response I got about a minute or Tony are only\nWould I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... birth to Syrian are fully fully discuss I'm\nTold me what about this the charge of sex lives of their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nOn the person who gives birth to the baby becomes a parent's uh after that happens on it's no less are no more ... regardless of what the motive delivery is and says area and delivery I'm certainly makes you just as much as

a honeybee labs and but I went Robie and worked on bumblebees instead I started a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to honey bees bumblebees have a very different like cycle right out of the colonies gets dark\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social on there's never a point in their live in a life as a hobby queen where she's living on her own the bumblebees are different and they have an annual lease\nUrging the colony and these queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd start their own nests so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary and sex are part of their life cycle to\nYou and you were brought an show us we're ...\nI did yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor with social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\nAbout ... meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time really well to be to be right\nWell I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focus and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals in the colony contribute to forging ... at home\nYou're brought from ...\nFrom I'm here in California looks like so far she on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what you are a little bit longer there but yeah and they're like ... and then once you see on the sidewalk\nAnd what why are you interested in\nThese areas and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ...\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing I brought here as a cast ... and flip it over I was on its head\nOh so it was like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes use their like pouring foster parents\nThis is the top part about six eight inches long it looks and just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did win cast as his ink um which is a type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when his hardens it's easier to dig around and will break the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of Fox so that determines how they can go\nBoating house there's so much focus on queen bumblebees wonder about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said the ... the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this and there were those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other search trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point uh but we think that there are probably also factors in regard to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just haven't looked for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your audience let's start right or were there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm my um my mom is\nAllergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets style\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack up for a certain you work with ... and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not buy movies\nTerrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me to\nUm those a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the venom and it'd be interact\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question but no longer answer also lived in big groups with the queen Howard there are large different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of species and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground raised bees will and\nPut their hives inside fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example those honeybees and some species offense will relocate from one site to another so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends will also there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances in our dark places or there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have a colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so the leaf cutter ... can be a ... million individuals\nAnd just been talking for Halloween I Know that you also started social spider word or social spiders\nSo upset about more than forty thousand species of spider is only about forty species are so our social um and what happens is they are living groups and the reason we think they leave in living these groups is so that they can capture pray that is larger than them and so they offered lead build these\nKind of retreat structure is where they live and they raise their offspring together so that you see behind me as a team or a bunch of faith in spite of moms there actually each one is probably the size of the centimeter centimeter half so half an inch or so\nUm it just taken with a macro lens\nAnd the small individuals or their babies that hatched from their ... um and so they take care of all these babies together with their standing on is basically a little ...\nAnd then they build another Web that's what we call the capture Web and so that can go basically on on a whole a case of tree um and that's where they'll capture\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nDid you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard but I Am not the only one I can see from the audience that district's about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great\nIn a bad idea to consistently lose disease chronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... thing but it is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles\n[noise]\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is yes\nFor um the majority of long term studies\nThat have looked have found that if you get significantly less will significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night than that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah 'cause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is not going to ... in all honesty I'm In the six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe up with the kids not get enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which\nMakes you at higher risk for infectious diseases and it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes and I mentioned about genetics\nOf genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what about sleep what our genes control would it\nBe the hour the than the number of hours that quality what what is one of the genes\nDoing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes is you're not just talking about\nHow genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nOn the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day\nRecently most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep the things about sleep that preserve your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep then improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused\nOn now what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study be on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have had a lot so remote one is what's known as a clot scene\nYou have clocks in every selling your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears talk to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know the clock is er [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell you\nYou have to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes to low turn the heat on your terms that's how the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these work similar to there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it says to go to another and works the same way in our bodies\nIn the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from you know so when you say the clock\nIs that the the circadian rhythm we've\nBeen talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down at night um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours Russian overhear yes I have a question about napping\nAs I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of in the south\nSo napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself than an hour and I do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap in my office in the afternoon no one can complain you can write at all I Know what I was researching [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is the napping is very important if you're not getting daily stuff is asleep and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nAn hour's usually was about recommended but anything from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting stuff is\nToo much too much and that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh so I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either exactly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just me let me go to the questions on this uh yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day\nBecause yes [laughter] and and as a parent\nI definitely want that to happen because getting my kids up in the morning before noon is a challenge how does your study a fact our decision making and farming our society in that arena\nSo the quickest way to answer your question is that my study doesn't affect that at all\nBut there is a good reason for that and the reason for that is because the science behind\nAdolescence sleeping and timing the fact that adolescents on such a adolescent masturbation is associated with a delaying circadian rhythm is well known since I first came into this profession what would you bring up as a great point about", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Gadsden", "day": "19"}
