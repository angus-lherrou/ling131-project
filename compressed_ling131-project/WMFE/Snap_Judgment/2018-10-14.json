so I took his rifle on I turn around and I'm very intently gave it to John and I sat here John do you mind holding this for a\nMinute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled him up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie any patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like pattern among the shoulder and they're like ... will die like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goes and may praying they mind their own business but there is a guy in their country that's been charged with\nA really bad guy you ought to themselves president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to release study their religion\nThe men were from Pakistan where

sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back in my suffer pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into\nTheir own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our chapters as as evil as you might think even though we are seeing that murder somebody I very much a\nMinute's victims of circumstance in some way or the specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there and saying you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up a rock bashing his goals\nAre stabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys drove to manage jump on this guy and to fight his throat gets teeth or a sharp weapon that I've got might be better than a sticker raw and um yeah as in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters are ... split on now with only two characters with guns to far climber in they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it and then five minutes and I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but they just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guide to Base Camp and now I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nAnd do one at the climbers to continue up the mountain among with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kinda say this weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come on me to [noise]\nAnd then we were all going to go together it's summer there was safe and and obviously man that he has the story that I had spent a week selling children's father hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him Denali\nServed pleading with him not to go in dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than they split\nUp do tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere was just this ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted a scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and the anger name and I think you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of train especially since there was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they were the game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find a\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way but also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this was the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge went back and the top of the mountainside\nWas maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything to them and we'll be morally and killing somebody but\nBoom boom fusion as Anton ... support me off in a second

would always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to theory terrible headache and he was diagnosed with it now formation in ...\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now from Asians\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but then the brain situation didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time when ... became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone\nOr you know I'm without his and but I felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel that way I Would say it's like I say it was about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nUh just knock that coming out on the surgery as a totally different person I think it's when I was scared of\nA different person center was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery\n[noise] sometimes people experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that and

brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him since\nHe was worried that if you changed the green you changed him\n[noise] so I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out in everything wants them all men are familiar\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant
