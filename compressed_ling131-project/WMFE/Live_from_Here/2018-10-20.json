to Buffalo New York along Lake Erie\nWere the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecast was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeve shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years in their tablets filled with stuffed animals they lined the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and the monkey was attached to the steering wheel\nThese are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys she goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the main made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger\nThey don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids\nI guess I was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie\nAfter growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they wanted to go to the hottest place I could find but it turns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for lizards\nPeople who stay there too long start to look like a sponge that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we have a lot of moisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water man I grow when it's not raining it's snowing and when it's not doing either we can count on the message from Niagara Falls are you here to see the

gives the snowplows time to clear your way home [noise]\nEnter what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in light years assigned coasters stuck to the wall the kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place but so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beer to big pausing to grab while he worked he says he's been in this bar for Thirty years and that he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way it\nHi I'm up on taking all of our president and general manager of make the point is that what do you imagine it's been a for two years since we first tried

wings\nI have\nChris had a big hartfield laugh\nHis kids are grown in just him and his wife down the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking\nI don't understand what everybody's after I mean sure moving to another city might get you a little more money but when you lose from being away from your family is too big of a cost everyone complains about their parents in Chile shell out twenty dollars an hour for a babysitter and\nThen suddenly we're not so bad\nHe keeps busy with this bowling league he said people like to knock bowling but it's

we're a little nervous we lost one of our guys to a heart attack and there's a young team called the kings that's been gunning for us\nWe refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was a lick any split\n\nAmong the trophies was the fate of newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was the captain the last year they won the state championship\nThis was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day have you ever started to tear up about bartenders glory years
