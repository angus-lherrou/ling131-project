I I Know there was consistent work the entire time what that didn't have much room for school\nWhen the family needed more money she take more time off school so she could no and when the family moved to follow the crops she'd move with them\nOne year she changed school full time cheated bonding or make them the truth will she thought this was ... it wasn't until the filmmaking made a documentary about her that she ... she was different from other kids\nAnd to see a room filled with about Fifteen hundred people and they're all looking at your story is mind bottling it was crazy that I was being nowhere and it's just something that I didn't even know was\nA problem and then that's when I realized that it was a problem and not the way I was living was not the way everyone left\nThat was the first time she had the tongue challenge labor and she realized it describes a that was seven years ago now she's made it to university which is an activist on child labor campaigning and supported the ban\nI definitely feel like children shouldn't be able to work into the ages at least sixteen I think it is dangerous for the safety of these children in their education and I know there's a lot of people like me out there\nAre some people say well surely is a right to feel if someone goes to school and just started a couple of hours in the evenings or perhaps a couple of hours that we can to help get them income would\nNot be All right [noise] oh\nThat's that rain debatable I Know these families want their children to work to bring some income in but they're just hindering their education and I think that these families also need to find a different\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years or later health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nLike they've had to go out in the field to work and that's because you know my family moved on to a different type of job that provided more for us\nSo it sounds like you're saying it's almost as though you need to protect these children from by choice if they might make for the best reasons right\nI feel like these children shouldn't feel obligated [laughter] does that make sense\n\nWhen he was little she felt she had to walk she felt responsible even at the age of seven\nSo she says most should be done to lift that responsibility of the show that the children like come on\nAnd on to the parents to find another way to ban helps do that that ... [noise]\nBut to some of the poorest families in the world that is no other way\nHad four well we can and cannot do\n\nMeeting yeah\nWe have been able to actually create religious which had been tried labor free my address the mold of these shows in the video conferencing man it is possible to create communities where they supposed to do me a bit of children simply going to be\nNuts can be to rotten them to be working on child labor issues in India for the past few years and she's now director of advocacy in fundraising it's concerned for wasn't children that's a charity the bucks and buying glow\nCharging that says the ban on child labor isn't working\nThere is a lot of pressure in countries like mine to insist that is No Child labor any more and more sectors certainly in exports victors the idea is to say that these products of clean they're not touched the hands of child labor\nBecause they've seen that's connected with child labor they wouldn't get any money for them they wouldn't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't even acknowledge their presence\nSo when the authorities come across child labor as she says that instead of helping them they want them to dissipate in\nAnd your children are found working the state's response is come in white ... put them in and take them away to China's gate homes they locked up but you know the way from their families and the state of course the family and there's going to charge would never ever be seen like this again\nAnd when they're released most of the children go back to work because the problems that drives them to work in the first place I haven't been solved\nAnd this is why ... organization comes and they meet child labor as an advantages and ... than not that parents why they walk\nSome talks about the whole meal they get to the factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school oh they said they had to counter the younger siblings so fetch water all of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey are not willing to try for the burden on to the family for instance if they were fishing water they would not or even seeing that your mother fish water and you'd be in school because they were seeing my mother has a lot to do and really\nThey have to find solutions that wouldn't put more pressure on their parents and so it could be threatened is charity tend to what's known as the chance India's local councils\nAnd a lot to do the work of my organization has been to walk with these local governments which isn't sitting with them and the solutions in one case can be as quality for the child who has no money\nIt could be more funding for ... cat so children don't have to look after the younger siblings\nAnd then other kids of each year for it and not just chime in and out of their kids it can be getting electricity for house once we don't have it and that is how\nWe were able to create ... communities that a country like India\nAnd by labor free and she doesn't mean these are communities where no children look what she means is that the works that doing no longer interface with school\n\nLike type ... and she says some what can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with we talked to children and actually come up with a document called work we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking because most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids that you feel ... walked according to the coast which are very to implement and which are very happy kicking they said nobody should be doing it because it's hard for work it's dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments they find out what the children want some like be exhausted by hours of household chores and preferred to spend to al it's working for a local shop of this might choose factory what if a milking temperamental Jersey cow\nIt's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to meet the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited\nBut a child to perhaps continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give the child that choice in fact this kind of work actually increases are responsibilities when they're working with children die typically you don't let them take that one decision and then forget them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life\nThan our children's council throughout bind a long time consuming and expensive but it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor C.
