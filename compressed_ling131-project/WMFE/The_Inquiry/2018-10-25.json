[noise]\nHow long can we miss [noise]\nHard won\nIt all in this case\n[noise]\nWe're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to we were born right on the spot in history [noise]\nI'll say thanks that witness cool Christians [noise] what do the dachshunds and then he is then one day decided he had announced that tracing paper [noise] he now runs the Danish aging with that sentiment well he's trying to tell people getting in the first place [noise]\nWe all know what age ... from the outside what is it actually due to a ...\nWell ... accumulation of damage\nFrom the molecular level then spread to the shells and a tissue and organs and to the whole organism makes kind of all the hits that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging\nStarch and when does it all began when do we stop to decline that is in the mid thirties dot ... seven seven ... yeah now do you stop Oh thanks for the good news [laughter] sorry\nNow professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor College of medicine in the un\nDoes she think carrying on the experiments into one of the most exciting new areas of medicine a micro biome\nNow so the eyes of let tell my co author is I'm living together ways as Ashley all over\nOur body farm that digestive track either side our body to the skiing outside our body so that everywhere\nYou can't see it with the naked eye but I might create buying it on an inside us most of it just made up of bacteria but it also contains funky viruses and other microbes to in the past scientists haven't given it much attention but we now know it has a profound effect to not building\nThe studies show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can even friends how the way they have\nAnd all his show powwow will respond to different medications and sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play that important to keep U.S House the\nMain one wanted to know whether I'm micro biome has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three wakes cell that makes them want if a law that it's a tough subject yeah [noise]\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the ones micro biology wouldn't live longer [noise]\n\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside a ... gun [noise] tweaked its genes to make different varieties and then sent them to separate groups have one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the ones expecting them to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find in fear cases animal I not that they're still alive when we checked them jumping up down because he just totally unexpected and how long did some of the ... list so about fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah\nThat's extraordinary so you had most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that lived fool four and a half\nFour and a half yes I'm with that much more than you would have expected yes I think scientists sometimes we do research it's kind of like ... [laughter] ... we have\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care\nIncluding nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nFind that rates out that's the best moment and so they went on to test other things would have different microbes buying gift ones will Tony a longer life with a better quality of life in that final days\nSo they are way way way way can look at how well they have when they're older they called worm when that getting older their physical activity ... so they move slower and also become a letter that al ...\n\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly one [noise] and she's right you can tell their own blog younger ... around and the older ones moves loaning the skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they showed rank has pets can towels at ... ... is not as good as they used to be\nThe ones with the new Mike right by a tiny wrinkles around will quickly in their old age\nThat they would like to go to disease to [noise] make wine is now carrying out tests on mice to see where the changing ... extend satellites and so there's a chance that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same\nFor us some my colleagues say oh hey you know I think people can live to ... say ... years so personally I think why and jak for me is already that number [noise] so how long can we live full [noise]\nWe had about ... to get us to a hundred and Seventy five [noise]\nAnd how it different micro biome could give us fifty percent more time on us\nBases inventions around to dressing the symptoms of aging\n[noise] cool [noise] well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nHeart for\nFighting you're so by do oh\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that loan Harry's professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. a scientist who's ... is because a lot of people excited\nBefore now it's will be a bit of a holy grail actually and I failed now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get on that I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nI Want to call begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves\nSo basically the organs might\nHave different type of tissue your tissue tomato different types of spouse now sells got told that some cells and say you live or your kidneys or whatever will be dividing to repay some cells are kind of dynamic anymore when I Know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would call ...\n... comes from the lush and what kind of scary which means to grow alone and that's exactly what's happened to these cells they've grown old and come to the end of life cycle but instead of dying they hung around acting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence Sal will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells ran them so it's almost like a self saying I I'm an old south and you guys had been around here about the same sort of a matter of time if I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... as well\nWow so it's almost sort of contamination with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive to cells around it and just ...\nAs we grow older more and more of a cells becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\nListen you do they make the cells around them HPV Austin these innocent sound stop functioning as they should which is thought to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension consent type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Henry's wants to know whether she can get these sounds just don't behaving like a little cells behave more like young one\nHappened that was I had a new research in my lap and she was to find enough seats and we have some old south and I have some kind of cool\nAnd she suggested ... percent ship it some of these chemicals on these old skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to see\nThat they would still my ... so they look kind of lacy under a microscope\nAnd we have a particular died that we can put on our fell coaches the times blue if that's the message and so when I was expecting to see is that the south would be still blue and still looking old and she will they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south to professor Harry said no no you've got the wrong cells these are young sales go through it\nAgain and and she did she did it again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she put me in a sterile I'm wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... scientists and yeah they were taught to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it fails diabetics probably ...\nHow many rogue city services for about nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of looked at them to actually maybe you're onto something had\nShe'd done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenated on south in ten minutes young so\nAnd this is why loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and invested from all over the well is the first experiment this reverse aging in human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nWhen it comes to our lifespan sink low in a hurry so it'd be the most ambitious of all our expert witnesses instead\nOf human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up paying you the new generation of empty degenerative drugs with all the way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular\nDisease what I'm hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those one side of the people he would have died on eight will then go on to live than not true allotted lifespan\nSo how long can we live we know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song from what we've cut that stick out it's like you to write [noise]\n\nWith the discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro biome and still cost sounds aging how many years ... well if we go by took him ... predicts and if you're a millennia like me\nBorn in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five by the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who knows what else would be possible [noise]\n[laughter]\nThis inquiry was presented
