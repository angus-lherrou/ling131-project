M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nShort time on any number of levels both in terms of political violence and terrorism but also in terms of an order that is rapidly shifting and you know we have a spectrum of threats and it's it's I think it's difficult to distinguish what's the worst and what's\nThe most threat they're all threatening the roll back because they all kill individuals and they all target individual\nApproves I've never I I have to say that I've never um walked into a school or up my place of work and fought and was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days would say they didn't ever think about um being afraid for their lives when they go to the movies or when they go to a dance club I mean this is something I feel that's clearly different\n[noise] yes well it is it is there's no doubt about it but we shouldn't lose sight of what we said earlier throughout the United states history at times of great position is polarization alienation we've seen an uprise repeatedly in this kind of violence before and after the civil war\nIn the late Nineteen century during the period those are just realization\nAnd modern communications we saw two presidents assassinated within Twenty years of one another certainly in the Nineteen sixties and seventies I think that you know terrorism hate crimes\nReston sit along the fault lines in our society what we're seeing right now you're quite right is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memory but don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states so\nThis is not in terms of the violence on priest in it but in terms of the mood that both of you in brief described I mean absolutely there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely eroded\nFree let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag talk a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events\n[noise] well I think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant\nIn this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical you try to lump light the premises violence in with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has that you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing him because a number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who were trying to vote\nPart of the problem of lumping white supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacy terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream stake in the politics\nA lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the news that are being espoused by the G O P and particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic care as an Amazon Amazon terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society of America is not\nA majority Muslim nation however the ideology of white supremacy is very much in the may issue of America now of course we have come\nWe have made a lot of progress from where we were in the past but she just guess what is happening now in a way that discount be centuries and generations of this type of violence that we have seen in this country again I just I don't see the value in doing that\nBruce Hoffman is a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the council on Foreign Relations and brand new some bass is an artist and community organizer in North Carolina Thanks to you both\nThink he will match [noise]\nAnd we're hearing from you do you feel like hate is on the rise in this country\nVery when calling us from Brighton,

I don't think that hate us on the ride I think it's the same amount of hate we've always had however before now people knew it wasn't acceptable\nBy the ... out nasty thing I don't believe that either hate crimes I Believe that they are terrorism\nHi this is living from Monroe in North Carolina there has always been hate the we have to rise above that\nAnd be the best person and we can be they have

Pittsburgh, PA squirrels hill area and I'm really angry and really sad and it was very frightening [noise] but it also proved\nTo me how strong our community is when everybody turned out for the vigil last night and it's just making us stronger we all need to be together and I think the most\nImportant thing is we have to start voting for people to get in office that would change the gun laws and I

radio international in collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston [noise]\nPut American voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle the winners of the midterms have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map that happens every ten years\nAnd it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level here\nTo explain more is Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the twenty\nTwenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and redraw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\nDo where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional district need to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district in it may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust alliance get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change and what kind of a role\nIs redistricting playing in our upcoming mid term elections\nIn a vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps so it's a fairly important\nProcess that takes place every ten years you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors what are you seeing as far as money concern\nAddition to the fact that the U.S house is at play in terms of flipping from Republican to Democrat\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to Gallup pd there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip\nBased on the outcome of the election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to end the R C has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gay fifty thousand dollars in support of Ohio redistricting measure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have doubts\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager

M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nFunding efforts in state and local races\nCertainly the look we're able to do who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective was that for them in terms of redistricting well\nI mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers where most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country or in at least a vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all [laughter] no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical it's a critical use of our sense is that the critical thing for those of us who want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue is so overlooked or misunderstood or not understood at all\nRight I I think because most people are just trying to get through their day and every year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries this kind of politically ... [laughter]\nThe whole process involves just a lot of ... and it's really\nA game that's played primarily by the insiders are the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are paying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the Indy RC\nAre very aware of it Denise Ross barber is managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise thanks for being with us thank you very much and [noise] [noise]\n\n\nThe take away is supported by huge originals on roadside attraction presenting diaper cloud starring Susan Sarandon as a mother struggling to free her captured journalist son also starting math Omar and found out in theaters friday\nAnd babble European made language learning program babble teachers practically conversation Toyota Russian leaders and other languages available maps or or online or B a B B.

decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how ... views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement poses and I guess ... as a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focuses on the story of Derek Black\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents and the movement that hearing now is racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an accent of the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\n... welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the center God I thought about your book\n... black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger at the synagogue and I'm trying to blame him for that but do you find them black story relevant\nTo the views that were expressed by the shooter Robert Ballard I think you can draw a straight line\nThe bar for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health covered the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many

am to white nationalist\nSlogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word sort of statement of purpose that is central to what strong front does about um you know securing a future\nFor the white race and the existence of white children at you know in and\nSaying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get get murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's the way that they speak about this\nThat gap is pretty small and in the social media space in it I think it's about a half million users and but uh it really embraces this\nSort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones that conspiracy theorists who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't doesn't allow for it he's he's one of the most popular people on gas Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab and also the danger of of other social media networks is that it allows for people who already have some of these ideas\nTo sort of cultivate their own reality and ours when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation\nBias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care of caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like\nShe'll have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In store front is a site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the sound your son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too\nFar and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\nSo you have you spoken with either gone or guarantee black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels and small waves culpable and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the\nPhrase white genocide and said to popular icing on the movement said to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building saying the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a ...

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air to social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe'd like to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now seeing those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast so the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like yeah but in particular I ever earned white nationalism instead I was just saying\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far as it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better um\nThe the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nDo they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the what is actually the Clintons to word [noise] um racial with our ...\nOver the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think affective we identified a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or if it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talked about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eli ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nUm\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors\nAre and who the victims and heard of them are exactly the end of that\nAnd this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in other countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or\nPosting and the comments section and that quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors the day where the people were making society worse\nIn back to being attacked it it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand that and American culture you know won't be ... quote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists I'm\nTalking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white miss and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that you know the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy and and for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races and different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that um your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nAnd there was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with regard to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition and even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that\nSo the conclusion and the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands of posed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post reported ... the author of a book about Jared black and white nationalism called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break this is ...\nHi this is John bus decker to me Ninety point seven W.
