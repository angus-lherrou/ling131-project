she's a senior analyst at the national Security Archive who's researched us and Mexican Government documents regarding the event Kate thanks for joining us\nI think you times you know so we are talking about a turning point in Mexican history tell us what happened fifty years ago today fifty\nYears ago there was a real bust student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight\nWith students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country pouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedoms for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful\nKind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico and that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement ruin strengths and the demands became sharper and more articulated\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students\nWith the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during the protest meeting in the public square at ... in Mexico city on October second when dozens of students and bystanders were killed and injured [noise]\nThere were reports at the time that armed snipers were up in surrounding buildings and shot towards the plaza which then forced a military response what do we know about what exactly happened there\nSo there was a very aggressive stance on the part of the president can start with the ... that the students themselves had been firing from\nThe building overlooking the square to simply wasn't true it was a lie and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings that overlooks the square where we're ten thousand students and other people were gathered to protest\nAnd that they had fired down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit to the military to move in and harassed hundreds of people which is in fact what happened\nEarly in September of this year we saw major student demonstrations in Mexico city and I'm Wondering when you see\nYou know students and young people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there in between what happens in Mexico today versus fifty years ago [noise] sure\nBut I don't think students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they're pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity or from the government today I think they're pouring into the streets because\nForty years ago almost to the day forty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get it at the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and if never showed up and the government has done nothing uh censor the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government\nAnd in fact the Mexicans just voted in a person to be president um Lopez Obrador who does not represent neither the ruling party nor even the sort of\nDominant opposition parties but a new party that he has found that so there is a kind of a resurgence let's say\nOf hope for change NF demand for 'em an end to the kind of a huge less violence that has been going on in Mexico for much too long\nAnd last week a commission from the Mexican government recognized the massacre as a state crime in your opinion you've done a ton of research on this is this sufficient and is it a step towards justice you\nKnow it really is and the government can emission that recognize that is in the new and important in a commission that is was set up by the current government opinion yet to to provide support and attention to victims of violence\nThat is not a government recognition of state responsibility for the crimes of local Mexico is a long way away from fully\nEmbracing the state's role in killing young people on October second Nineteen

I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened over the last year it's been almost a year since um the ... came out\nAnd there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society and we start talking about what consent looks like ... daily lives in orange ... and in dating\nWhat is consent how is it being defined

mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it taught me depends on your situation how about trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that particular scenario

mean we really don't have a lot of options for how to handle situations so often happened years ago or even decades ago um I said this is one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't

people I mean some people do you just have to go through the criminal justice system this is just an alternative option that I wasn't aware of before making the documentary and that\nWe wanted to bring to the table as a possibility\nFor some people is there any other way that people should be thinking about getting to that level of reconciliation without a face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness in a way that that's the end goal but is it\n[noise] no I mean and what sorts of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survivors to be in the driver's seat\nAnd so it's up to them whether they forgave or not or whether they want more sessions or whether they want to continue the conversation or whether they want to just let it go\nThere obviously many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure and this is definitely not a building and solution for everyone I Would say that there are limited options because you know\nAs we all know the criminal justice system is\nOften fails us and when we want to handle these situations and six out of a thousand cases of sexual assault go without convictions and so we have very limited options but this is just one of the ones that we tried to showcase hair\nAnd at the beginning of the film you

on that department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you right about now agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a triple a prize the big decided we'd ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been suggested to decades and decades of of abuse and score\nAnd it's collected Ross and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know is paying much attention because of slow moving stores and this to me you know\nWhat aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government managers are very long\nTerm slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up uh\nYou know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and ruin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long\nTerm approach and on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's ... that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done when positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people are there people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their

health dot com slash kids\nIn L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did you turn on the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's for sixty five percent or so the budget it goes to this one thing you know what each the Commerce Department\nAnd the national weather service night\nAs a National Weather service is a bit and the other was services the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department as an actor vengeance so it's there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institutions within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and I'm into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather that sounds actually like a good that he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm so here's the problem ah typically the person who\nRuns no or as as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better or all of that saves lives and property or\nIf that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and very Mars or\nHas been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just actually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIf the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and\nYou know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is Oregon eyes especially a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all they need to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a government operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public so Barry Myers\nOr had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now [noise]\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people and the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the court landing team we send a list of standing for questions you wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the question\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him a list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nYou know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the ... are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those department are antagonistic poured those department\nSo yesterday was actually there is actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economists and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you change the ... people don't sense it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking it lots of you know one and a million or one hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it ... comments where she showed you that people don't really feel this and that insight is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark they tenth anniversary of the financial collapse if he's asked an eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis which you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets\n[noise] well I'm a big question the question you asked me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really our job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one outlandish production on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole all that money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a war way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you treat them as a national crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming\nIt's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like ... predict\nWhat might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happens you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ... when they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later health over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nWere going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nMm Mm [noise]\nMm [noise] [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis his new book this this risk is about the federal government under Trump\nA lot of the government is often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything ...\nSupposed down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and I'm so lazy stupid people is it has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy change through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department the Commerce Department\nAnd I try to having exactly the same experience the political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconception but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like um this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have cut up contempt veg contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be briefed and be you know it'd be kind of informed about these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes is is a mission driven person they're not paid well\nUh there there 'cause they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids the people in the department of energy scientist about a passion for their particular size because they were little kids essentially it's essentially what they are all these people are firefighters", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "02"}
