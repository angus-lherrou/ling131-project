T. government\nAt first it was a left wing protests that we tend to have here in Brazil and then in the meantime or after the first one the second one the one that got bigger and bigger if\nIt was a simulated as a a right wing movements\nAnd then from then on they started organizing themselves or they went to the streets against it again in two thousand cj dean asking for do my roof says beach men and then after a while they got that\nAnd well all this structure that was against Beatty now is supporting John you both so now do this stream ride politician and things got really ugly in that point\nWhy do you think it taught this extreme to the point where mostly not really um could potentially be elected\nWell I think it has something of a sudden character because well I don't believe that we have a fifty percent of the population tend to follow ride sauce I mean it just to be ten percent talked\nEvery last election and less Thirty years\nBut then there was so much rage and so much hatred and there was also a media campaign against BP and focusing a lost in the corruption scandals that serious obviously\nBut they weren't only be T's fault and then people this rage and hatred became a support for this terrible character this terrible guy\nThat people tend not to see all the tea and maybe they don't want to have the exact conscience of while they are actually support to\nEase motion honorable exploiting on any of the conditions that exist to social divisions that exist in Brazil right now\nWell definitely mainly the middle class in such a section because well er during the the workers but the government during the Thirteen years they were in power there was significant growth for the poorest\nBut middle class the state more or less the same\nSo they were after awhile closer to the forest and to the richest [noise] and this created some sort of the stuff this section through a great part of our population\nAnd now I think both so NATO is exploiting exactly that\nPass the support of these people even though his his policies won't do anything good for them they tend to do a lot well for the reaches north for the middle class\nAnd I want to read an excerpt from an essay you broach and ask you to to tell us a little bit about it in in your essay you said quote\nIf Brazil were not drowning under so much rage so much hatred so much yelling if there were just a single moment of silence perhaps everybody would be able to hear the alarm bells sounding something is in danger\nIn many ways including on this feels a lot like the moment in the United states that were living right now are you concerned about what you see is what's happening in Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nYeah definitely it's a great reason for concern\nIn well perhaps we are now in the frontline of something a lot bigger I'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances we've had in this last decade in Brazil that seems to be the case that please\nBecause there was this a progressive governments for Thirteen Years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and besides the reactionary\nIn Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been in the United states it's being only Thirty years of democracy at this point\nSince the last dictatorship and you never know when the military will get in the way again we'll start gaining power and becoming something else so it's a great reason for concern that's an ugly\nAnd in terms of those in Brazil in Brazilian society who would be most vulnerable under ... presidency\nWell first of all that's not really the poorest because she has a very violent drug run for fighting crime organized crime and without considering the risks of that\nThan arming great part of the population than giving license for policemen to kill without any serious investigation\nSo we know that in in the ... will see a lot more blood then we see now which is\nVery serious and of course there will be also persecution over the ... it'd be the community because he's been talking about that's his entire career women will suffer\nBecause well he he tends to be against policies of the quality\nThe indigenous community as well he doesn't want to preserve their land\nAnd the original black communities as well so it's mainly the most vulnerable will suffer more and we don't know if that will be something similar to what we said during the dictatorship that was persecution ... of activists\nHe has said things that's point to that idea but we are not sure how he was planning to do that or if he's planning to do that at this point is just a vague menace and well many people don't want to see what it's called\n... is a Brazilian writer and author of the novel resistance

the handling of a guy [noise]\nWe continue now with my conversation with Sasha Jenkins about the restored version of his taskforce Jenkins Nineteen eighty two film Cain river\nNow I Can't speak for everybody on Cain river but that's how I was a model for\nThose people that didn't make the point where we treated everybody equally\nEverybody needs Thomas I never see you again\nWhat is the author gums as a matter of fact that's of off the dumbest thing I ever heard though [noise] they don't want me to you because of something that happened two hundred years ago\nThat the film's protagonist Peter who returns home to fight for his land in Louisiana as he tries to court his love interest Maria when they sat down with Sasha he told me why this film still resonates with viewers in twenty Eighteen\nLand ownership is an important part of the story and there was a statistic that someone in the film said that like every week black folks are losing a thousand acres of land and\nBy the year X Y Z black people won't have anything and I thought that was a really powerful idea the sense this idea of ownership and land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land\nAnd the ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of what it means to own land well we're here so if we're going to participate we might as well be owners as well that was an important sort of subplot in the story that when you mix that in with feminism color resume class there's a lot there\nDid you learn anything about your dad that you didn't now it didn't have a sense of through this film\nWell you know my parents split when I was young and\nHe moved on to another relationship the the woman that he was in a relationship with before he died\nShe's from the region and she worked on the film and had a hand in sort of glowing him into the world and why it's interesting and important but inside of the romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents\nYou know what that courtship might've been like because it was there's something very\nI don't want to say simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's it's very genuine that you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny\nYou know what I mean someone said recently who saw the film that it it has a very eighties vibe what does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties so what does that well you'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the uh parents would designer jeans everyone's ...\nRocket designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great there's a photo Matt you know I don't know for those who are old enough\nTo ... days we used to have to take film right actually get a developed right at a little hut that was usually stationed in a parking lot there was a photo Matt\nYou know so the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now but I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling the story of how my father would make everyone listen to the soundtrack and he made me listen to it too that's the one thing that I always remembered\nBut in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way was kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight teams do you think that there is enough nuance uh black everyday life in those\nFor Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nDo you see the filmmakers are getting better at\nThat well I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to be and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes and why marketing money\nOkay this is very specific group of black people like these hair care products that you can sell stuff to people I get it but I think this sort of box that that same litter you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small it doesn't fit anymore and um\nYou look at you know my man child is ... you know you look at this sort of new wave of\nOkay here's some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so I have hope that things are changing but you know changed never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also a filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming up\nWorking on a four part film about the Wu Tang clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um to really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like\nTo really peel back the lyrics is to have a real understanding of who they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues jazz\nYou know all these art forms or reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so the total tanks or you've got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so\nTo me the music is the cherry on top it's all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad's filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film\nI say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop fashion and you you learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means we're a nice suit but they don't realize it means in certain states it was mandated by their slaves and nice\nOutfit so they can go to church worship God that's white or supposedly white there aren't a lot of people looked like me who have the opportunity to say things and so I like to entertain people but I think it's also important to say something so every film I Do and my father would definitely feel very strongly about that\nSasha Jenkins is a writer and filmmaker\n... thank

G. or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nSo in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to you write that on\nThe college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paying\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it sometimes\nFor Ninety point at a news comes in our land out how to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six ... more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nThe tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach you say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bringing them to me there are things I don't want to know\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government is charged in this case we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of this story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges [noise]\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go between\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bride is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send him to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player\nAs your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more\nSo if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a walk if you have five or ten over those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might not up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded their special issue will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your trial should go to they\nWill find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and a lot of the players want to deal with known quantities\nAnd part of this is there is a money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go betweens set you up\nWith a with players\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nAfter a break he'll talk about some earlier scandals involving Pitino and whether college basketball players should be paid also just in trying to use the new fantasy thriller suspense Maria I'm Dave Davies now this is fresh air\n[noise]\nNew our family foundation supports WHYY it's fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit is involved Louisville\nMove it was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\nAnd in the strip or gay case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on um what did Pitino say about\n\nRick Pitino who's written a couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees a sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\nIn stripper gate and in this recruiting scandal there were people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now\nCoach Pitino has a pending case against the University of Louisville athletic association which technically paid a salary and he's seeking the thirty five million dollars which was left on his coaching contract\nMike ... book
