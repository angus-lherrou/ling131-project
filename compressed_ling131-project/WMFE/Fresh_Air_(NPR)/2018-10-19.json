along this week I'm Tom Hudson in Miami\nAnd I'm Melissa Ross in Jacksonville well Tom in Florida Panhandle today the clean up the painful expensive clean up is slowly continuing after hurricane Michael devastated the region conditions there are still dire\nNow this is the most powerful storm to ever make landfall in the panhandle and emergency calls\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Monday points that double you imagine it's been a fool two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising cold be fine with Dr and this is how we do we now have you been in the family\nDon't get support from hunt interrupted programming donating a dollar a day and if you will call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nTough days long nights long weeks ahead and just a couple of weeks of course until the mid term elections here in Florida folks in northwest Florida may have a hard time voting will\nBegin this hour with a closer look at the current conditions in the panhandle Scott Kaufman is the station manager at W. cage ISI in Panama City he joined us now\nFrom the bay county emergency operations center Scott the governor is expected there I think in about an hour or so tell us what the general current conditions are here a little bit more than a week after hurricane Michael came ashore\nWell it it it's just very much surreal um every time that we go out it's a very hard to kind of imagine that this is this is our home town I'm ... but the officials here mentioned pretty early on\nUh before a lot of people went out that it was a little bit disoriented it because you're ... you're landmarks that you're used to seeing are nowhere to be found and um that is the case that uh\nThe term is used the a lot that it looks like a bomb went off where it looks like a war zone and um unfortunately that's pretty accurate and we have a lot of military here on on the ground assisting and that does help with the old witch either\nHow widespread are ... our fuel shortages Scott and we're also hearing a lot of folks just don't have access even now to water and food can you bring us up to date on we're the greatest needs are there\nWell there there has been a little bit of fuels fuel shortage we didn't report any widespread fuel shortages obviously in Panama City Lynn haven area um there's still no power in some places there for the pumps don't work\nOut but there are places around that are beginning to um have gasoline as we go across the bridges we like to refer to it over to Panama City beach\nAnd further west there are gas stations that are available there um which really slowing things down is traffic or because everybody has a either going in or going out at a at a high rate of traffic so people are trying to get to the beach where there is food and water um as far as restaurants\nWould you like to expand the number of dispenser ease the number of uh of nurseries that are involved in the medical marijuana system as it now exists in Florida\nIt's one of the biggest tragedy to try to get what happened during the last election cycle is that they put a number of tax on the amount of factories and retail shop net are allowed to be offered off her each of the license holders in our state and we're fourteen license holders and what that means is that\nIf I Would you like to expand that no you know\nI think that number it no no I\nAnd ah I think it's a constitutional [laughter] I think putting a cap on the amount of retail by is unconstitutional\nBecause it really prevent access to our patients and so our license holders are putting up to ... and the more urban areas heavily populated area and so a lot of our rural communities are never going to have to centuries under this regulation\nDo support the allergies that have put zoning rules in place that have essentially banned the ability of dispensaries to open up\nA holiday season on well I'm that prevents access and so I think that what needs to happen which is what was in the previous laws more local control\nOur local government what happened during the implementation which I thought so hard on is that they have an all or nothing approach either he cannot regulate them any more than a pharmacy for you ban them\nAnd what's happened is that so many of our local governments you dealt with a pill mill situation and I'm scared of medical marijuana are bad enough where I Know that so many of them would rather just regulate them um and so I think that banning them completely in your communities in the ...\nAnd I have said that on the record a couple\nOf banks so Wells Fargo and B.D and cheese they refused to continue service senior campaign account because you had contributions and it from the medical marijuana industry they were worried federal\nRegulators would punish them for violating federal drug laws you'd like to ensure that the new medical marijuana industry can bank legally that's a big hurdle for this growing sector and that\nAlso to me points up the difference between how the feds see marijuana and how a growing number of states to Canada and there's a big disconnect and there are a big legal hurdles for your vision of how Florida would move forward this way how would you navigate your way through that\nWent well Fargo first shutdown my account they were very to say that uh they were not supportive of my former expansion of the secondary was the fact that I was taking money from\nThe marijuana industry and the reality is is that politicians and unless officials all across our country has receiving donations from candidates interest of for for years\nSo I definitely believe that I Would I be targeted at my campaign on the sun it it's given me even more motivation that I must be on the right track if people like\nA this issue easier and really solve a lot of the the more controversial elements that are still a bit doubling us but uh it's certainly something I'm I'm Glad to be a part of them have been for many years now\nBut but would you wouldn't go as far as your opponent is that fair to say in terms of the ag commissioner directly managing this industry it leave you take a more conservative position is that right\nWell I Would say that I Want to see the the program managed effectively a department of health I think has demonstrated they're not\nUh over here uh to to help see this program be as successful as I think it should have been a one of the challenges is that the subsequent constitutional intimate and twenty sixteen actually provides for a permanent role for department of health it's it's actually one of the\nProblems that we talk about on a regular basis on a you know legislating sue constitutional amendment and so uh I'm certainly open to having the department of agriculture or serving the largest capacity can or in whatever way is going to get the program a effectively manage to implement it in the in the state of Florida\nLet me ask you as well you are a as it's been sent the central casting candidate for this position you're in seventh generation Floridian you come from a family of farmers you know so much about agriculture\nYour opponent is an urban night a lobbyist or sell you come at this from very different backgrounds and so uh let me ask you what would you bring to the position is someone who's grown up in the agricultural world and also\nWhat would you say to critics who feel that you've been to industry friendly particularly environmental groups that have taken issue with some of your votes in the legislature\n[noise] well it is ironic now I'm On the er the agricultural candidate so my primary opponents or criticize me because I don't work\nOr on a day to day basis on a cattle rancher citrus groves\nOr we do have a family history and the state going back to Eighteen twenty six and\nA I have advocated for ... natural resources during my last eight years in the Florida House or the district I represent today is north Fort Myers Lehigh acres in Alva I and it's really a great a mix of issues you know Elvis still one of the most rural places in Lee county uh we've got the ... river that flows through the\nThe district and the issues we have to grapple with their Lehigh acres is an overwhelmingly blue collar working class community north Fort Myers a lot of fixed income seniors and retirees\nAre and so as a result as a as a state representative I've had to be a diverse in terms of the issues we've addressed detention issues in elections issues and are trying to make sure we're we're dealing with a medical concerns and things like that but my passion was bagging natural resources is why I ran for office to try to address\nEverglades issues and water discharges in the ...\nAnd I think the the progress we've made over the last eight years is a huge benefit or you know the environmental community is diverse it's not a monolith or had great working relationships with nature conservancy and trust Republican land and the Florida wildlife court or spent three days actually hiking on the trail with them on their second trip\nRepresent what say ... what what what do you point to in terms of the successes and environmental policy when you're seeing the blue green algae come through that river through your district\nYeah yeah it it you know everything that we're dealing with in the bad outcomes in the environment as a result of of years of decisions a hundred and fifty years frankly of bad decisions\nOr you know no one could live in South Florida if it weren't for the flood control project that's the big picture\nOr that I think often gets overlooked or where people live today and Davy and Wellington in West in in Miami lakes and highly uh uh in Nineteen forty seven and during that flood year it was four five six feet under water the Fort Lauderdale courthouse had three feet of water it\nAll of that water today gets sent down to ... river that was by design that's what the fuck info project does\nIf we're going to change that then we've got to change the engineering of the system that is what conference of Everglades restoration project ... to ... people will hear talked about much sixty eight projects that you can't put the water back where we used to send\nA it's a federal trial date money and uh some of that water or could go to a reservoir some of it could flow south or did the historical routes as opposed to the east and west but when you point to environment your environmental record again what are the high points if you again or seen another last summer to last summer's in the last\nThree or four years because of the blue green algae\nOr what you you're exactly right we shouldn't have had to suffer through those we should have built the sixty eight projects two decades ago\nA and even before we signed up for that agreement which is a a fifty fifty cost share a they were projects you know you go back to Nineteen eighty seven and the feds identified the U. S. forty one should be a bridge so water can flow I was in first grade were building that now with state dollars for one a easy example the last three years we built\nA those bridges on us forty one with ... dollars because the feds ignored it for Thirty years or since they identified it same thing in the larger a restoration projects we knew we needed to build they weren't being built and I help secure\nThe permanent funding from the state two hundred million a year or starting in twenty sixteen out of the amendment one trusts friend dollars and we're going to build we will build more projects and these four years and the next ten\nWe review for decades and we will continue the conversation with\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of maybe point seven W.
