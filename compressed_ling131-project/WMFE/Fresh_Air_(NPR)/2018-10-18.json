violating the league's domestic violence policy and while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays\nThan the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area Whitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public\nRight now about the OSU nah a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case then a a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nI think they're just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended a and eventually just about a over a month ago the criminal case with wrapped up\nWith a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of\nProbation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of conviction um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh yeah the the details are just a little\nFuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way so let's talk a little bit about ... a current domestic violence\nPolicy like what is it it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's led to some long term suspensions like in the case of Bo sooner\n[noise] yes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen I'm there have been a handful of investigations suspensions to this point and no sooner was the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a suspension it was the third or fourth one this year actually\nI'm most recently Addison Russell of the cubs were suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse\nSo are there has been players offended before and after you know he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because there was a trade that was involved um but MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and as they do not necessarily wait until a criminal cases and completed\nThey do their own investigation they speak to victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account and overall the processed it a little bit\nA kind of like ... case it's a little bit um [noise] non transparent we don't have a ton of information about\nWhy it was Seventy five games as Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past few years we don't really know what ... investigation\nConsists of ... um so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the ... case you're saying\nHe's the third highest number of games he must have done something awful\nBut we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the suspended under the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players suspended for steroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a tricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigations go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as I'd like it to the Astros decided\nTo trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that it was soon actually makes the teen stronger what do you make of\nThat [noise] yeah I think it's a ... the way I've seen it the Astros have been a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs\nDid this with our oldest Chapman a stark closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago and it did win the world series and it worked and fans kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it widow sooner um the ... been a little bit more blatant about that what we're doing um you know he ... he throws good pitches he's gonna win he could win a World Series when\nWhat's interesting about this story is that the arrows now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that purely for the optics of ... having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of\nWe now that we've created for us you know we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a is an important thing for the actress foundation which has a thirty million dollar and Dalmatian um so again he kind of fed the quiet part out loud we traded for domestic abuser\nNow we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that I feel like they're trying to have it both ways\nIt it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse presence you know ... flew an H J Hinch Jim and manager of the team have kind of like\n... he's a he's a great player she can put that path behind him it's great and now they're donating I'm Around three hundred thousand dollars to\nLocal women's shelters in Houston, Texas area and um [noise] partnership with the Texas council and family violence so they put the work and they have cooperated but it is a little bit having it both ways we will see Whitney

Suzanne ... and David Barstow who along with rats Buettner published a long investigative article this month but ... use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should\nSell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision so\nThe interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFred Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meetings after ... died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the buildings that were still live those buildings ... own at this time of his death I'll get it also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included boasts of buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much ... empire and it sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer named ... and the price tag was just over\nA hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through the thoughts sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars than what the banks with value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have gone for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that are us actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the low valuations they're placed on buildings made the trumps pay for a few million more bucks on this returning from a few million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you and you've got an agency that is pretty over match\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and Jim extract\nA few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nMost families who you know wealthy families are the most expensive legal and accounting hoping who gauge in these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nTo avoid or their taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more of the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the or else which has been hit very hard but budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just under state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these\nBooks or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals when public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or other combat [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well see publishers are come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie ... skills getting himself back on his feet well within him a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with the moment when he was just taken\nOf twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of the comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their

that early no health dot com slash kids\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump built and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump\nMade his money and what he did with his money and has great negotiating deal making\nAbilities\nAnd so many people still believe the net and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nIn that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think we've reached dot dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America [noise]\nUm but I think that we've taken that I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents shop and it gets really hard to refute the story um charger few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for us to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it allowed\n[laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in to one day with a with a little documents and [laughter] it but we uh yeah it was ah\nJust the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy but a little ...\nLittle ... here I imagine [laughter] other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors do but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up\nTo and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Orlando", "day": "18"}
