M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nDevelopments and he runs into an awful lot of trouble with the banks because his project start failing banks don't want to lend to him so that starts this new thing\nAround the beginning of this century where he starts licensing his name and that's the way that the Trump Organization has always presented it we license our name we don't actually do the construction not what we found is that\nDonald Trump and his children even kind on junior in particular would go around and they would imply to people that their family had\nEquity stakes ownership stake in projects and that the sales of these projects were going fantastically Ninety percent soul sold out these are the kinds of terms that were being used when in fact they didn't have an ownership stake they weren't\nSold out the window the purchased restructured was it they would get their fees no matter what so they would get paid the projects would frequently fail\nAnd people who had invested in them bought in would lose their money\nAnd the Trump move onto another project\nAnd say the same thing we had begun to see this in various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent it was the fact that it's a pattern was what was alarming to us because it suggests that it is a business model it's not just a fluke is not just a project or a couple of projects combat\nAnd there's a about a dozen deals that you guys focus on in this episode and in particular there's one on the Trump ocean club in Panama City sounds a little bit about why that's so important\nSo the ideal caught our attention for a few reasons one is that Panama is a place in the world that has a\nLow rating on scales of corruption meaning that it is very corrupt at the time the Trump Organization got in Transparency International rated it worse for example than Saudi Arabia\nVery low worse than India so this is a country that is also known for being a place where various narco traffickers want to run their money money laundering and want to run their money because there's all of this banking secrecy in Panama this is a project that went bankrupt\nAnd we have we serve on earth through this extraordinary process our colleagues at ProPublica on earth the audio tape up even with the Trump in an interview she did in two thousand and eight where she was asked about this project\nAnd we have any projects or at least for now it's filled with salt over Ninety percent of it and I'm always on there for a lot of free market ever scratch prior to our entry\nNone of those things were true and although the interview was published the audio has never been heard before and you can hear how this mechanism work and it's okay to say I am going to build the world's best building I'm going to build\nA such a beautiful building everybody's going to want to buy and there's actually a concept illegal concept known as ... free which is fine you can see that it's when you start to make\nSpecific material representations ends you do it repeatedly that it becomes a question of whether there was actually a criminal fraud committed here now having said that a lot of the stuff happened a long time ago very far away so there are all kinds of\nQuestions have jurisdiction there are questions of statute of limitations but I think what this deep time has done is really\nSort of make it clear to us that these are not fluke situations but they're actually a feature of the Trump business model and they sort of really changed the way that we view this licensing model which seemed like a really great idea no banks want to lend to you you just sell your name you don't have to worry about getting the financing\nBut that is in fact what happened in fact what happened is they got people specifically to buy in based on lies and miss representations early on what\nIs the Trump Organization up to now it's funny that you mentioned the name and just over the weekend there were some New Yorkers who pulled the a lot of money together to get the name off of their building honestly\nThink they did they took they took a like a cherry pick her up and took off the letters of this building which is something that's happened since Trump's been president there are still Trump projects around the world that they are actively working on their working in projects in the Dominican Republic they're working in project from India\nThey're working in projects in Indonesia both Trump's sons are now on the campaign trail campaigning for the causes and candidates of their father but at the same time they're also going around the world\nSelling condos to potential investors that we don't know who they are\nAlso the the president hasn't fully divested from his businesses\nHe has not there was even one point and twenty Seventeen when Eric's Trump admitted to Forbes magazine that they actually we're still talking about it officially he's given up the day to day control but he can still make money from it and that is the thing that ethics experts say is so confusing you never know in any given situation whether he is making a decision as\nThe head of the Trump Organization because he could have some personal profit or if he's doing it\nBecause he's the president of the United states\nShouldn't that'd be I don't know illegal\n[laughter] I think to some extent what has happened with Donald Trump and it's it's sort of like broken the ethics systems for example the situation is just come up with regards to Saudi Arabia\nBecause he's done business with the Saudis and he took this initially sort of muted position on what looked like the murder of an American journalist resident in Turkey and people were like well why is he doing that is it because of his business ties\nAnd the fundamental instability of this situation is that it's impossible to know\nNow you also want to send out a little message to your listeners on the podcast go for it\nRight so we have been hearing from some people who had bought in to Trump developments and we know there's a lot of takeaway listeners and in some of these places in Hawaii in Florida a lot of people in the

the weakest temperatures gloss heading into the weekend this was Ninety point seven [noise]\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight to pregnancy discrimination act was passed to protect against discrimination based on pregnancy and childbirth or other related medical conditions but forty years later how well is the pregnancy discrimination act protecting the modern workforce\nDeborah dinner is an associate law professor at Emory University and she joins me now Debra thanks for being with us\nHello thanks for having me so tell us how is this law meant to protect pregnant women [noise] well what the pregnancy\nDiscrimination at Nineteen Seventy eight that it's on I'll call it the PTA\nIt said a men's title seven of the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four and title seven is a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex\nAs well as race color religion and national origin and what the PTA does is it defined sex discrimination to include pregnancy and discrimination on the basis of related medical conditions including childbirth\nSo what are some of the limitations to this law I understand it the conditional law can you tell us what that means\nSo what's the pregnancy discrimination act does is it says that you can't\nRefuse to hire someone just because she's pregnant or you can't deny a promotion to pregnant women because you have stereotypes about mother had\nAnd it requires that pregnant persons persons affected by childbirth be treated just the same as other persons who are similar in quite variability or inability to work\nIt's a requirement effectively at the same treatment\nSo the biggest limitation of the PTA is that it's only an anti discrimination mandate and it leaves many workers bereft of protection\nAnd so what it doesn't require it doesn't guarantee enough ferment of entitlement ten accommodation in the workplace so let's imagine a managerial professional and a fortune five hundred company\nWhose fortunate enough I'm lucky enough to work in a workplace that gives generous paid leave so if she broke her legs she could get safe for weeks of paid leave similarly if she became pregnant and ... needed leave before childbirth or after childbirth she could get four weeks of paid childbirth because she would be treated the same\nBut let's imagine people who work in warehouses like in the recent New York times article they work in low income jobs um where they are much less likely to have generalized protections for disability said their employer gives no for example no light duty accommodations to any worker when they fall L\nAnd that workplace and anti discrimination mandate does not get you very far\nSo just the requirement under the PTA that pregnant workers be treated the same as other temporarily disabled worker is doesn't get that much protection so they won't be given light duty which poses a risk to their health and the health of their fetuses\nNow I Wonder if this have anything to do with the fact that pregnancy is considered a disability clause in this law because it feels like we're we're treating pregnancy the same as we would a quote unquote disability is not as a separate category is that right\nYeah the law\nIt's important to recognize that is not actually mentioned the word disability what the law says is that sex discrimination under title seven includes pregnancy and then it gives you an example and it says that for example pregnant women should get the same benefits as other employees who are similar\nIn their ability or inability to work\nSo it might be helpful to explain a little bit where this idea of temporary disability came from feminists lawyers in the seventies where really worried that any\nLaw that specially protected pregnant women would lead to hiring discrimination and so they promote it kind of an approach that with sex neutral that analogy eyes between pregnancy and temporary disability\nOrder to use anti discrimination as a kind of bootstrap to get pregnant women some of the benefits\nWere available for temporarily disabled workers generally and to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of pregnancy but again this uh\nSupport for

suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been a leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this then the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case\nFor restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people\nFrom registering to vote in that state's the federal court actually struck that law down earlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote\nThat part of the law remains in effect and I looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed in Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one vote and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly\nWho's a member of the state Senate an independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in Kobach favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas\nFor Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando how to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nFirst time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what kind of combat due to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally\nIn the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted legally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim\nAnd showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nKoh Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted to legally\nChris called back has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the centers and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is voting issue call back advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures it's used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine\nHow many electoral votes each state has so the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says\nI Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said it's needed because right now in his words the illegals or being counted\nWhen it comes to representation I I don't want to get to tactical here cherry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted when it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation an area should have\nWhat Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens if you did that areas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California\nWould have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way districts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift\nTo Republicans because generally speaking errors lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship has it been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and after it senses\nSo where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire sentence and so if a centrist is unfair for centrist is inaccurate and so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and\nHow it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression in voting rights I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\nThen you are a Family Foundation supports WHYY fresh air and it's a commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support\nIn places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ballot initiative the one that could affect the most people is in Florida\nWhere they have a ballot initiative that would restore voting rights to X. balance so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons can't though that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida including one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony conviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections\nAren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas in other states Florida has a chance to give the right to vote\nBack to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against the term incumbent announced that\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restores voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restore voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans\nAren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have\nBeen appealed as high as a Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Kevin on the bench which has been a nation on voting rights [noise] he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights\nHeat up out of voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state by cabinet wrote the majority opinion upholding this law and he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud\nThat states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota light Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on\nThey can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\n[noise] it's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea that voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive in his words and in fact\nEverything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia orange taste that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent front if you look nationally and voting front how pervasive haven't then\nStudy shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent\nBut incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast so even in states where there are no\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of maybe point seven W. M. F. it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising cold it's fine with Dr and this is how we do it now that I'm happy family\nDo you support and interrupted programming but donating a dollar a day with W ... or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nI'll matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud of New York in the state without a voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their address says I'd have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already and\nI Would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine\nAnd I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that so it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most\nAnd so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or see\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman is the author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America he's also a senior reporter for Mother Jones who's been reporting extensively in the latest developments in voting ... we'll be right back\nThis is ...
