Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nWarns claims of native ancestry and even nicotine her Pocahontas the accusations surrounding warns ancestry date back to two thousand and twelve let her Republican challenger for the Senate stop brown accused warn of using her Native American heritage to advance her career\nGrand Lee brewer is a contributing editor for tribal affairs at high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham Hi what was your reaction to Elizabeth Warren's decision to take this test and put out this video I\nThought it was very interesting I Want to be very clear I'm not here to discredit her story or the common knowledge of her family that that she's been passed down I\nWas more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this conversation with Elizabeth Warren and also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning and I think using a DNA test to\nValidate that history was probably the wrong approach\n[noise] it's interesting there because you don't want to criticize I guess her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the message the way that it was done was the issue a DNA test itself was it that it was covered up by the media inappropriately\nI think it's all of the above when we're covering Indian country weren't covering tribal communities we have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them the problem I had with senator warns approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that his damaging to native people\nTo give you a little bit of contacts I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am\nNot much darker than she is a outwardly the place with a video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma that's where I'm Talking to you from now\nAnd so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history or in fact I Would encourage her to do so but I I think when you invite people to talk about the degree of of your blood quantum which is the degree of your Indian blood which is something that is documented by the government\nIn in my case certainly\nYou're opening up two conversations that\nFeed into stereotypes and Mets about native people blood quantum is a very uh ... subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of of native blood so\nBy putting a stop on me a degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is a choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood is you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eighth\nAs more of a say or is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance I I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we are talking about a political distinction this was a citizenship question I Am a citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nCan you help us understand a little bit more when you talk about blood quantum what does that mean in the Native American community\nSo when the government put many of us on the trail of tears my great great great grandfather for instance they wrote his name down where he was from and where he was headed to that record still stands and it makes it easy to easier to trace my lineage back to\nMy Cherokee roots that way I can show the nation that I Am a descendent of this person I Am a member of this nation and I can be enrolled us such now some tribes\nHave blood quantum in place uh my my son for instance has also parked Iowa ... the ... nation of Oklahoma you have to be one force\nPilot to join the Navajo Nation is similar but when it comes to DNA tests I think we need to keep in mind that a DNA test doesn't prove that you're a Native American there is no DNA test to shed say definitively you are an indigenous person\nWhen it comes to tribal issues DNA tests are used to show who your parents\nAre to show that lineage to show that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am tired or I Am Cherokee or I Am Navajo\nI'm Wondering in terms of the media coverage of this did you feel like native perspective we're being included in the reaction to senator warrants decision um to release this video I felt\nLike there was a lot of attention given to Senator Warren how she feels about Trump's rhetoric towards her which I Will agree is is not okay it's not acceptable the way President Trump speaks to her about race\nBut I felt there was more emphasis on how Senator Warren was affected by it rather than how her response affects indigenous people I think\nHer response helps foster this narrative that like I said to her blood quantum is important or that a DNA test can prove that your indigenous neither one of those things are true it reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street\nIs is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion\nThey don't feel like Senator Warren has made efforts to understand them or their perspective\nAnd they feel again like their own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically but there is an invisibility problem with Indian country\nNon native people by and large don't understand Indian country they don't understand sovereignty they don't understand a tribal membership and they don't understand like I was saying that this is a citizenship question as well as a racial distinction\nI think all of those things together just compound the problem of misperceptions and stereotype that permeates popular culture when it comes to Native American people\nScrambling brewer is a reporter with the high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation

those highs and the middle eighties\nOn ten Xena Vega welcome back to the takeaway\nWe've been talking about the Proud Boys and the rise of far right hate groups with tiny Hernandez professor of law at Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights also with us is David ... author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center\nAnd Tanya I Want to pick up with you what is the driving force behind men in particular some men of color to have joined this group is that racism is it ...\nIt is both I mean talk about a paramedic intersection all example that is the conflation together of both of jet anti gender bias\nAnd race bias the ways in which this is I guess you know you would say for a toxic white masculinity and men of color are no exception to that of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up\nIs it becoming easier to sell in this current climate it is most definitely easy to sell because it combined both\nA quotes of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that he talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting as if you could take away from this ah racism\nI'm just curious how it is that people of color who are not by definition white Kenyan gauge with that type of thinking\nBecause what they do is they disassociate this idea of waiting is as culture from racism and any anti blackness has also reduce the idea of a sudden about blackness it's about fat black culture\nDavid what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states\n[noise] well in some ways it's actually very old I mean I started during this when I was covering Miriam nations in Idaho in late seventies early eighties and date to claim that they were only for a white [laughter]\nAnd it's one of the realities of Ford's from is this group says that's you know they'll claimed to just be pro white and\nDefending white interests but notably they're pro white advocacy becomes a tax on other race but that's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is the underlying dynamic here is less white supremacist them than authoritarianism and that's what they're selling\nAnd authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries\nI'm you know we've got one of our main sort of a ... groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer\nAnd they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man has this big Simone drive so uh yeah ... and I see all kinds of non white you know is joining their right\nBut when I talk to them every one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality Tania you wanted to weigh in here\nThat I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects and and as much as that\nNow these white supremacist groups are claiming to be welcoming to people of color I'm not just that they're pro white and is is just about culture and that they're not actually racist but they were OK with having non white members be part of their bandwagon\nAnd while they may be very much by authoritarianism and I agree with you there\nThey're also spouting lots of pro white rhetoric at it I don't think we should be just missing that as I say in his budget has about authoritarianism it doesn't mean it's not about race\nYeah no that's absolutely right um it is it's very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of all the new because\nUh they're marketing it in ways that I mean the always the radical right was very backward looking and the shape of the ... radical writers very savvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is a problematic\nWell I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest or nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponents but footage from the fight that night shows the police\nSupport for Ninety point

including us all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nAn assumption that there was support here from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD David do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nYes I Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement system trucks country right now as being very heavily politicized\nBy organizations like the earth keepers a rich specifically or you know since centrally patriot very far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement\nUh and they're succeeding so yeah I've been out covering a lot of these and I would say Portland police in particular are very prone\nTo I'm acting in defense of the the right wing side and I'm very much acting against the they very much the the uh anti fascist says the major problem and I think that's the problem Tanya your your\nThoughts when I find fascinating about this David is that I think another aspect of this is that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in this white supremacists authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are serving our it's just about free speech that these folks are checked spouting their ideas\nAnd I think that's part of the underlying problem here is\nThe stereotype of the United states has been so absolute is about free speech that you can say any kind of heat for saying on the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it results in violent although history shows us how intimately into intertwined racist speech is with racist violence\nI Do want to point out that we did reach out to the NYPD the takeaway did for comment about their response specifically to this incident and also\nThe claim that Gavin McGinnis said that he actually was supported by the NYPD so I'm going to read you a brief um a response from the NYPD and they said that they called me and it's an individual who's a provocateur tour who does not speak for the NYPD\nThey say the NYPD is a diverse institution dedicated to keeping safe all eight point five million New Yorkers violence and disorder like what occurred on October twelve is unacceptable and will not be tolerated and the the statement that go on so they did respond to this request\nAt the national level what do you see uh do you see this as a trend that's going to continue to catch on is this something that'll go back underground what's your experience tell you\nYeah my experiences doesn't really help [laughter] just because this is all new I'm I'm obviously I think we're all hoping it goes back underground but I I'm not very helpful in that regard because I think this is very much a creature of the Internet\nDavid night where it is the author of all to America the rise of the

'cause ask them the best picture books and a graphic novels for young adults his new book is a graphic memoir is called ... how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction\nHis mother was a heroin addict his grandparents took legal custody of him when he was a turning three\nAnd this is a story of his childhood\nFill your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but then they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\n[laughter] you as\nMy grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and it very much keeps me afloat [noise]\nThey were tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with\nThis had come home from school and somebody wrongs me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go on their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such dislike Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nI got to go back to school [laughter] they were so lovingly\nCrafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever curse at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise]\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah her and my grandfather just bemoan the movement of ah having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where she said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah he died from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday or my wife's wedding shower with Sunday\nAnd in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife she'd be over and and my mother my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always have thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her nose oh gosh that's dangerous as though they were so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people when they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother still this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie\nBecause that took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always at a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always frauds a ... surely was also drinking a lot of them um she she drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just for us\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years later health has over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nBut if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make a word and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but catching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same schools and building for all those nine years\n[noise] your grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and certainly certainly weren't the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help you do stigmatize you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me art was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in mind drawing\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these craft as he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to kill your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I can get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you've learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was mean that that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel\nThis is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles\nThis is how you have to ask\nAnd so she as an as an educator of the arts and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally and in that moment uh and and back then this was the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that is a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop fat he did but that's not what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter]\nFrom the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for you\nYou certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punches been fully blown but\nNot right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise] you know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] donating you ignore everything about [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hey kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction is nominated for a National Book award in the category of young people's literature we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThen you buy our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from ... I'm committed to changing lives through math\nWhen I saw her at a book event of mine um she she had all of these track marks on the back of her hands on her arm and she she blamed on the dog jumping up on her but I just knew my heart I knew and ah surely after my second child was born\nA this was December of two thousand and eleven she started getting arrested again and so in January of two thousand twelve\nHolly who is who she is my aunt's by lineage but my sister or by heart and soul\nCalled me on the phone and she said did you see the paper today\nAs a hobby [laughter] I live in ... I live in our in western no agency the paper what happens and ah my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies and I went in person to talk to my mother had her court date and she she has she assured me that she\nWas not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here and I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know what I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd uh and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will and you know you do ... I Would worry I wake up in the middle of night thinking\nWhat if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long and ... process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was ... it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and and I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like ... you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home so I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that she would worth address ... to to my wedding\nAnd so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd ... even the company me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had plane that was response or you know I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly would be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was\nWhite as bony had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks her shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute and I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mum beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and and all all of a drug paraphernalia\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know what there's a there's a teeter closet and this other woman right yeah of course I dressed that was that important to her she would preserve and the cedar closet\nSo I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is and on a little nicer than I saw him again and then on the lazy Boyd hair I saw three handguns next so that was to hand guns and now I'm realizing I'm On a room filled with handguns with my back\nTo someone who is high on heroin and I said this is exactly why I didn't come to visit my mom his last two years because this is exactly what I figured I'd step into so now I'm thinking what if I'd done\nWhat if I die here my children need me so I I made the boyfriend like I just need to be alone with my mother's things could you just give me a moment so he he moved and you know\nLoud as I could I said well Steve and you know the the dresses and here I'm just gonna go to Macy's and uh by her address

this painting I made for her ... as quickly as I could grabbing handfuls of things I wanted to hold onto in the events that the house blew up the next day\nUm wow and so now I'm I'm making preparations for my mother's memorial and we didn't publicize the memorial I didn't put in the newspaper to afterwards\nBut now I'm really fearful this guy's going to turn up with with guns and so I hired security\nBut the ... in the interim between that moment and and the memorial\nThat boyfriend was arrested for impersonating a police officer so he had shop lifted a number of items from a Walmart like dog food paper towels and he brandish a a gun and said no I'm I'm with the police it's good and and and and come to find out all of those handguns were Bebe guns made to look like real
