Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nUltimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but now she's coming forward with her full story and she has the lawsuit documents to prove it some of which are signed by Rodolfo himself\nRonaldo denies the allegations in it's called the story quote unquote fake news his lawyers have said that they will sue the magazine joining me now to discuss this issue arena Ahmed freelance sports writer and co hosts of the burning all down podcast Shereen thanks for being with us\nHi thanks for having me to you know we need some of your guidance on this story here so let's go over the basics of this who is the woman in question Katherine my your guy and how did she and wrote Ronaldo first meet\nWell Kevin or does actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about the ... occurred in two thousand nine she was working at a night club and she was an aspiring models slash actress\nAnd she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which is a policy I guess you get this entourage so he according to deter Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside\nAnd she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't shore and then he got\nHer number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warning for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that he's a documented a sane\nCristiano Ronaldo himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop so this is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words\nSo I mean afterwards she was in shock\nAs most survivors are she didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated\nBy him and under and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and filed police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was saying oh what's but he's so big he's so powerful and you'll get lost in this so coupled with her own trauma and the mounting fear of who he was because this isn't some too but player in a semi pro league arguably one of her best players and aspiring at that time\nSo it was you know it's pretty pretty mortified and she knew what she'd be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not as experienced and couldn't guide right away that needed to be but I mean she was and aspiring actress she didn't hop twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with a system\nSure and this is a this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen we had the U.S media been on this story at this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nUm and I will say this very honestly as because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis is the first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in a sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five\nBarely won anywhere made no wage I think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research myself and one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do examine it we pitched this story about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that Cristiano Ronaldo has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest change in the world\nI mean I don't know and that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue as maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think is is applicable here it as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlet [laughter] and no one wanted to or nobody want to destroy and I'm like how can this not be possible that this is the first time this happened to me the same thing with David ... the\nCritical keeper for Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated in a very brutal rape case a sexual assault of two workers sex workers\nBut also we we should also be clear though that that he that that ... has responded and denying these allegations right\nWell of course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Catherine Majorca three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and in NDA\nLike let's not forget that that happened then she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nDo speak all would not and this is something we have to address when we talk about media would not have printed that saved da da da and legal has gone over a hundred times if Christianity and all those team was going to sue ... would have done a year and a half ago haven't even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nRight and it and it also it was interesting to me that we are in this moment this me to moment\nA particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for example the Larry nuts are stories that have come out in the sports world another issue so I'm I'm really surprised that the lack of attention from the American media here\nI'm not it was the same thing with David to hand look what happened with Kobe Bryant he was given basic you know a pass by the media which was complicit in this I'm not surprised at all but I'm happy to see that her story is being shared now\nSyrian Ahmed is a freelance sports writer and co host of the burn it all down pod cast Shereen thanks as always for being with us and [noise]\nThe take away and

automatically be charged as adults in criminal court next to the so called raise the age legislation passed last year as a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail\nHot to be moved out by today [noise] New York in North Carolina where the last two states in the nation to make this change here to bring us up to speed on these two huge changes to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez\nThan he covers urban affairs here at our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high tens enough good to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect today one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged right and\nRight that's correct so said this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year old and that they're facing it in and said this is the start of the law said this is the first days of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been especially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm is the case involves sexual assault if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon um it will stay in this used part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that then the case will stay\nAnd what about this move that at the sixteen and Seventeen year old now have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so today the day and what's happening yes that's true\nToo so another thing to mention is that this lies not retroactive so that means if you're already serving in prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained in Rikers Island and just to give a freer national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country\nUm it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there and that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything\nUm your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nThat were on Rikers Island are now out of there now let's talk about where they're going to go said they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx\nAnd so they've all been moved there\nNow why this push for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this sad this change\nSo there's there's been said the last ... years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em in Rikers Island and they found that guards were using excessive force on them they were striking them in the had repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement\nUm and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island I'm In addition to that we have this young man named ... who is in Rikers in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed that he stayed there for three years he was in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on Pete his family couldn't meet the three thousand dollars bail\nSo when he came out um his story was told by this journalist Jennifer ... from the New Yorker I got a lot of attention\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd there's been lots of talk at particularly from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan\nTo essentially shutdown Rikers Island um and it's complex by twenty twenty seven twenty twenty seven I'm of course where all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly how does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop into about five thousand\nSo um [noise] this is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mentioned that to move people off the jails is to close down record them going to be controversial says the plan is that\nThe city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up new jails in ... I'm so these would be ... that are more integrated into the community\nUm to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are slanted for and there's been\nTremendous opposition so far what\nAbout you mentioned Klee prouder and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people\nIn and out [noise] um right so there is a whole debates about an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which\nUm seems like it won't happen there is those something pretty interesting that actually happening today too which is there is\nThis massive bailout that's being planned\nBy the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and said that\nUm mass bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nAnd women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people um they were trying to raise five million dollars and the ... supposed to happen through out the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see\nSome of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting the city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part of the planning\nProcess has been guided by this city Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Denise thank you tend to you know [noise]\nThat comment for this show up on our Facebook page we had to take away or leave us a voice mail at age seven seven eight my tape your ideas I have a huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about this is the takeaway [noise]\nA\nYear ago a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas he killed fifty eight people and wounded hundreds more\nPhysically and mentally I could try to healing private or I could just lead by example one survivor helps others confront the aftermath of their near death experiences\nThis afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\n\nStory listening this off the new ad for for all things considered here or not he point seven\nSupport for Ninety eight point seven news comes from the ice associates of Winter Park where Dr Gary Barker Dr Sandra Barker in Dr Caitlin Kelly has been providing comprehensive and preventative I care to central Floridians for over Thirty years I associates of Winter Park is proud to support local public radio on W.

meller and other reporters at the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had no section unity I was interested that you used the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] is very controversial in the journalism world because mine implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not you and you're saying it anyways\nSo people are getting just weighing lack is worthy of using the word lie or not she'll you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the ...\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a

documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se ... very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have\nRun fascinating stories here at the post about a times earlier in his career when

an ... year and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um you spoke to Devin Nunes has the Republican chair\nOf the house intelligence committee and usually that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing siege by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had got sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd that just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right there ... there was digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes\nWho has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications of contact between Jared Kushner and and and officials for Moscow and other\nMembers of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say it didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg

I'm not going to trust and not and I'm an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are you are guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy as opposed who those sources are so they\nCan be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really an an a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be on April I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know not really any of the information\nThat's actually write these sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust and because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well\nWhat does the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with source a source be but\nIt's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations are perfect and and then can we do make mistakes\nBut boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility and my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe recording environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types of metal to record what ... what transpired one of those talks about\nSupport for Ninety point haven't neither comes from Orlando

setting about the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how our people our news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\nKony is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody had on the pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting Trump goes on to joke about putting were to say he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once\nReporter spends a little time in jail they make new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism or anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pipes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell let me let me ... ... ...\nWhether it made me afraid I ... I was confident enough\nIn my ability and and how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back mhm um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening anyway Jerry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening and it's um\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders and vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nWe had Miller thank you so much for talking with us from thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you\nGreg Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "01"}
