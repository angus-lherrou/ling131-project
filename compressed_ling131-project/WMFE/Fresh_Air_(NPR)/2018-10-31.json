high but they can't they cannot come in\nThe way they want a government doesn't work that way [noise]\nWith less than a week to go will the president's message motivate his core supporters to turn out like they did in twenty sixteen here to discuss this Christopher catalogue all the White House reporter for Politico Christopher welcome to the take away\nIt's a pleasure to be here [noise] so let's talk about the president's messaging here as we said we've got one week before the midterm elections what are some of the big themes that the president is really knocking hard we've got obviously immigration what else are you seeing\nThe president is going very hard on illegal immigration as you mentioned he has brought up a very unlikely proposal but one that he thinks it's going to motivate folks which is a ten percent tax cuts on the middle class the president has continued his barrage\nOf assaults on the media\nAnd in the last few days he has really dialed up his critique of the Democratic party that is meant as something to really unify Republicans pointing to what he sees as kind of de extremes of the Democratic party\nYou know and wondering the president has made no secret of his thoughts on migrants coming from Central America for Mexico with the very beginning of his campaign so\nIs there a reason why he still really doubling down on immigration um and what does that strategy tell us as opposed to health care or as opposed to other issues that he should be looking at\nThis is an election that's really based on motivating his base nationalizing the selection around his supporters because of the question that Republicans have always had as there were a number of people who turned out for Donald Trump\nMuch of them Republicans but not all of them and the question was would they come out and turn out for\nA member of Congress or a candidate for the house\nAnd that has been a much tougher thing to answer and so if Donald Trump goes out there and says this midterms is really about me my policies are on the ballot you'll remember rock Obama said that need to be turned into a scandal will Donald Trump has been saying that exact thing\nAnd it's it's a way for him to ah to make this about himself in a way to really sort of rile up his supporters\nAre what I Would say about illegal immigration that he's focused on is this has been a constant focus as you pointed out I mean going back to the beginning of his campaign obviously earlier this spring he went really hard on the MS Thirteen gang\nAnd started using terms like animals to describe people which are generated a lot of backlash and so what he's doing is we we flash forward to the beginning of October\nAnd the president's political team started to get a whole bunch of polling data come back to them about this issue of immigration saying that in a lot of these marginal districts competitive house districts where Donald Trump is not always seen as a help\nIllegal immigration was resonating with folks this whole idea of the Republican Party being sort of the protectors of immigration and customs agents there was an abolish ice movement on the left obviously and so that whole issue was resonating and what happened was that the president sort of\nHad this migrant caravan issues sort of land in his lap after they had already decided that they were going to really close on illegal immigration\nWell and and there's also the the recent news that the president has decided to send troops to the southern border we should also remind our listeners that\nThis migrants caravan if you will the folks who are migrating are still weeks away from even reaching the United states border so the president's doubling down on sending troops and reinforces the idea that these folks are almost the scapegoats in many ways right\nYeah I mean a lot of these attacks a lot of these statements are not grounded in reality as you mentioned these people are hundreds of miles away they would not reach here like you said for weeks and then in the last day or so there's been this issue of ending birthright citizenship which um is has been\nReally sort of the third rail um and and it has come up and it has worked in the president's favorite was obviously a question from a reporter was not something the White House proactively put out\nThere well let's listen to that 'cause I I Want to hear that clip and then I Want us to sort of break that down\nAll immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution Wade executive orders exactly right or have you thought about that is the only law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of one and you don't need a\nNumber one number one you don't need that number too much into well you can definitely do with an act of Congress\nBut now they're saying I can do just was an executive order\nI think the president was very frustrated and folks around him were very frustrated over the last few days because the the narrative as folks go head to the polls and a lot of these states that have early voting\nWas all about domestic terrorism there was this obviously this is terrible a shooting in Pittsburgh and and ... you know\nEverybody sees these these things as the tragedies that they are but we have to say that what Republicans have been saying all along they knew this was going to be a very tough mid term elections Donald Trump knew that as well\nAnd what they were saying was you know all these issues come up and they they last for a day or two and then they dissipate and so they never really knew where we would end what would we be talking about when voters finally start going to the polls\nAnd they were talking about these these domestic terrorism issues that we're not seen as a help to the party so\nThe president saw the the migrant caravan a despite the fact that it was never going to reach\nA the border anywhere near election day as a political gift that was the term that the folks around him were using and then I Would say the same thing for this question that came up yesterday I mean these are things that are going to come up and what he's doing even if it's not something that they're generating they're able to amplify the stories and to really give them life and I think that\nIf that is something that allows them to turn the page on the type of narratives that they don't find helpful they're going to do that\nChristopher ... is the White House reporter for Politico Christopher thanks again thank you so much [noise]\nOr for the takeaway comes from babble European language learning program\nHousing it's also access to education you know we're not going to see declines in the number of people that are arriving to the destination cities like LA or New York or Chicago I think it's imperative that\nLeaders take that challenge and really create not only the infrastructure but also think through how other partners can come along in this process of agenda setting for their integration\nLindy Lopez is the director of the Los Angeles mayor's office of immigrant affairs and ... is the urban advisor for the international Rescue Committee thinks ... thank you for having thank you\n\nThis is my point seven WM every good to have you with us we're taking a look at the forecast reduce Halloween when

seventies we're back into the upper seventies lower eighties someday\n\nReturned back now to the Saudi led war in Yemen which by most estimates has displaced well over two million ... where the humanitarian crisis is at a scale that it's hard to fathom\nEven having been there several times before I was shocked at how bad it had become\nNew York times staff photographer Tyler Hicks has made three trips to the war torn country his latest just this month and what he found there was unlike anything he'd seen before\nOn Tuesdays program we talk to the New York times is Declan Walsh who's recent reporting shares vivid details at the desperate state of millions of civilians in Yemen a country now at the brink of famine a company that report were portraits captured by Tyler Hicks showing children and babies starving to death in the north of the country\nAnd the bloody conflict ongoing in the south I spoke to Tyler today about those photographs\nYemen's have very difficult place to work there are a lot of\nDistance to cover you know lots of checkpoints but there were a few places that we'd heard that people are really suffering and these are areas where people\nAre coming from a pretty large region and and getting to just a couple of really clinics I mean these are so much hospitals as as we would think of them back home these are very small\nClinics where where people come and however they can we found out there a lot of the problem is that the economy or there's absolutely\nNo money they earned by people people don't have jobs they don't have money to get to the hospital fuels very expensive and hard to come by and it it costs a lot of money for them to you know they're they're they're having a hard time just\nFeeding their families are let alone going many hours in a vehicle to get to a clinic\nThat's how we chose to go to these specific areas\nNow the piece that you did or for the New York times one of the first images that readers will see\nWhen they opened the peace is a photo of a young girl named a mall can you describe the photo for our listeners and tell us a little bit about what you were seeing and experiencing and really what struck you about a mile\nI'd been to a few hospitals clinics around the north and it when I when I walked into this particular one in a place called a slum\nI could tell that the moment that I walked and that this was a really were some of the worst\nCases were a it's an open court orders which rooms are surrounding it and just looking from that central area without even entering the rooms I could see that that the children there\nWere were really in terrible shape skin and bone and the first for him that I went into I saw this young girl a mall and\nThe poor child was just laying on on a cot her ribs just showing at least through her skin there isn't an ounce of us out on her her arms and legs just like to check\nIs so scary you know something about her face also shoes Gary ... child who ... when you see your body is just heartbreaking and and I I spent a lot of time photographing her um I I knew that as difficult as this photograph was to take\nAnd as difficult it is for the the viewers to to see\nI knew that this was going to be an important picture and an important photograph to be seen because she should really sums up how tragic and how bad the the malnutrition and the starvation has really become in Yemen\nAnd Tyler you know there is often a debate about traumatic images right on the one hand people will say they're just too traumatic to publish tend to look at um on on the other hand there people who say are they exploiting you know people who are in their most vulnerable state\nAnd as a photo journalist I'm Wondering how do you grapple with those issues\nI never take photographs that are difficult to look at just for the sake of of getting a traumatic photo or sometimes there's a reason to document\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of

I think it helps to ah in feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act just because they

said they didn't like Trump's temperament didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm\nPresident Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel the Holden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in a case\nI think there are all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him\nIs misguided one of the great aspects of the system which has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can't do anything\nAt that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices a throughout history have\nSuccessor leap proclaimed and demonstrated their\nIndependence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court rules against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith a president various FDR appointed justices remain friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to the president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with a course such nomination and you said some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\n... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination as was during the course hedge nomination why was he ... to lacked got\nOh ... they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives wanted instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we don't I Will go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinions saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst him not happen to think that Kavanaugh on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the capital will be closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional wisdom his affection for the court and for its own reputation may lead humans on some occasions\nTo rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively so\nIt'd be Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and

Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents for that or blame the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies and it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples to those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase\nThe size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house and the Senate or the White House and twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table\nAt all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals than an eleven member court you have a six five majority do I think that's possible yes\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of make the point that a W MSG it's been a for two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising cold it's fine with Dr and this is how we do we now have you been messy family\nDo you support and interrupted programming but donating a dollar a day the W.
