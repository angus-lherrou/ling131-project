President Trump says he'll send secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia after\nThe disappearance an alleged murder of Saudi journalist ... on October second show he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and hasn't been seen since according to reports Saudi officials allegedly tortured and murdered and may have even dismembered the Washington Post columnist\nSupport for Ninety points of a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children has been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nSide the Saudi consulate those recordings have not yet been made public but now Saudi Arabia says Turkish officials concerts there consulate meanwhile US Senators are pushing the Trump Administration to consider sanctions on the Saudi Government and business leaders are pulling out of a future economic conference being hosted by the kingdom\nSarah as easy as a journalist covering human rights in the middle east Hi Sarah thank you so much for having me on\nSo if the Saudis have denied any involvement in the disappearance of ... and I'm so far that's been apps and any proof as far as we know\nA there was just a breaking news alerts that they are now allowing Turkish investigators into the consulate what's your sense on what's that could mean yeah that\nCertainly an interesting development however really remains to be seen how cooperative that Saudi officials may be and we have\nHad on outside officials allowed on the premise this once before but it was very tightly controlled sort of more of a curated fewer than an investigation\nKeep in mind that the Saudis have had almost two weeks to make whatever preparations they might mean to you in order to ensure that the court investigation\nUm wouldn't go favorably for them so it's perhaps a positive development by you know we should be definitely be skeptical whatever may arise from that there's that\nSort of course President Trump of the world is watching to see what the United States a reaction would be President Trump was on sixty minutes this weekend and he said that there would be quote severe punishment if the Saudis were found to be involved with ... disappearance\nWould you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed\nWent depends on what the ... give you an example they ordering military equipment\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russia want her to China wanted it we wanted to we got it and we got all of it every bit of the\nQuestion I have for you is what kind of punishment are we talking about he's sort of talked around sanctions are sanctions still on the table\nThat is definitely a matter of the day at this precise moment we've had some members of Congress saying that they would want to go that far you know for the U.S that had such a strong and longstanding economic relationship with Saudi Arabia sanctions are treated sort of as the\nUltimate boundary of of the possible it's a red line for some people who tend to want it to focus on a more incremental perhaps more cultural soft reprimand towards the Saudi Government\nWhereas others say that that is the only really effective\nWay the only way to really convey the level of severity that they see in this case so I think on what everyone's really watching is that the threat that Saturday issued in response to some of the hands on which is threatening to raise the oil price is threatening to retaliate um\nAs far as their oil production goes so\nWe'll we'll have to see 'em what\nRisks are government it's actually willing to take but oil on weapons sales are certainly are\nYou know the meat and potatoes the foundation of our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nAnd you did speak with Jamal earlier this year what did he tell you regarding the Saudi state and the Saudi\nCrown prince yeah absolutely I spoke with ... uh several times for a few pieces I was doing I'm On the\nCrackdowns that the growing on suppression of all all types of free speech and free expression in the kingdom on ... on a really shared with me some of his concerns that I'm a well Saudi Arabia had never been a bastion of human rights are free speech\nUm there had been a little bit of latitude a little bit of space\nFor the press for academics and religious leaders tier perhaps differ with the royal family to a degree within some\nThe pledge of loyalty to the Saudi royal family however under Mohammed bin Salman we saw an increasing pattern of preemptive strikes the crown prince was locking up people who had not necessarily criticized him at all but ... who meet just feared\nMight object right before he gave women the right to drive for example he locked up a lot of the\nCountry's most conservative clerics in order to sort of head off any conservative critique and then at the same time he was censoring 'em or arresting academics and intellectual on a more liberal side sort of\nJust demonstrating and need to completely control the narrative\nFrom the top down as far as his reforms and his reputation and Jamal as a journalist really felt like he could no longer\nPractice his craft as a journalist with any integrity um many people are being asked to sign loyalty pledges he was receiving increasing pressure from the government and um he grew really disheartened with the regime he loves Saudi Arabia\nHe really expressed a lot of regret that he had felt the need to leave his family and his job in many many colleagues behind but he told me you know Saudi Arabia deserves better and this crown prince\nMain market um one thing may market a bright future for Saudi Arabia but without freedom of speech and freedom of the press that the really hollow promise [noise]\nSour as these as a freelance journalist focusing on human rights Sara thanks for joining the takeaway thank you so much for having\nAll right every one later this hour we'll be talking about a lawsuit that pleased Harvard University's admissions process in the spotlight\nHas a holistic admissions policy which means that the admissions office upset a whole host of factors when deciding whether to admit students this includes of course academic but in addition to academics it's also looking at\nMusical talent they are also looking at athletic and you know manning that sports teams\nI'm quite that legacy that are part of this and race is one of these factors\nAlso hearing from you based on your own experiences with college admissions do you think the process is fair\nMy name is Kelly I'm from a veto Florida My daughter had a four point oh GPA and high SAT scores and was not accepted to the University of Florida schools like this are becoming a weekend impossible to get aid to we have found that to have to apply to ten or more schools at fifty dollars each\nApplication fee in order to find a school that is right for them [noise] how can families afford this we have four kids and it paid a small fortune ... admission fee before we even begin paying tuition\nYou can keep calling us with your thoughts on the college admissions process is our number is eight seven seven eight my take this is the takeaway [noise]\nWhat I you know would tell people is make sure that you show up make sure that you have 'em all the identification if you have a problem ask where provisional ballots that you can vote on election day and then make sure that you call lawyers are those who are going to be there and be willing to represent you are right to the pro bono\nAndra Gillespie is associate professor of political science at Emory University Andrea thank you thank you

trial is underway that could end the use of race as a factor in college admissions\nA nonprofit group called students for fair admissions is suing Harvard University alleging that the schools admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants spearheading the lawsuits will conservative activists name Edward Blum was organized efforts to end affirmative action before here's how he describes the problem\nPatricia discrimination and it's a quota for the quarter today's against Asians much like quarter back in the Nineteen twenties and thirties was against Jews\nThe issues surrounding this case have opened up divisions within the Asian American community we spoke to a couple of students [noise]\nMy name is an issue I was in Europe David college another writer for the federalist I'm an Asian American but to me you know critical part of that as an American and I think that I Want to be\nOn the basis of Michael ... the content of my character\nRather than the Harvard which Asian Americans reading them for personality I'm reading the people that are less desirable college degree because they're in my name is\nSally Chen I'm a current senior at Harvard College studying history and literature and studies of women's gender and sexuality Asian Americans are being used as a\nRacial wedge in a lot of ways either way of propping up against other people of color and utilizing the quote unquote model minority net to perpetuate these ideas about who deserves to be in these institutions\nPersonally for equal treatment of all races regardless of your race or ethnicity I think that people should be treated on the merits and opportunity that\nAnytime cautious I've\nKind of racial balancing fishing by city usually involves turning away from people who were more merited and taking and people who are less qualified\nI truly believe that my admissions violent my application\nCould not have been as compelling as it ended up being for my admissions officer had I not been able to talk about my race in our really meaningful way along with my other identities as a child of immigrants as a first generation college student or someone who comes from a low income family it done and justice you\nAll students including Asian Americans you try to portray as we are a model and\nI grew up around Princeton New Jersey area um there are a lot of people there were very very obsessive college so I think that\nWhen when you have that kind of environment it really doesn't help when school at Harvard basically says year drought conditions not worth as much and other guys on the station turn it looks like you're trying to Carter\nSeems like you're not worthy characteristics that you know we can't change better so\nI don't think they're the person on the campus to deny that they have benefited\nFrom having a diverse student body and a diverse campus I think that in fact the conversation has evolved\nTo actually be more about how Harvard\nTo be doing more for it and it is to do better recruiting get diversity within diversity thinking about Asian Americans as being comprised of multiple ethnic groups including Southeast Asians and in more recent immigrants and Pacific Islanders [noise]\nJoining me now to discuss the lawsuit against Harvard is Natasha worry coups and associate professor of education at Harvard University and author of the diversity bargain thanks for being here Natasha\nThank you for having me also with us in Studio in New York is washed shoe staff writer for the New Yorker walk thanks for being restored to be here so Natasha let's start with you or you're currently at Harvard University which is being sued in this case are you involved in this lawsuit in any\nWay no I'm not to tell us a little bit about how harbors policy admissions work where does race factor in if it factors in at all [noise] so how has a holistic admissions policy\nSupport for Ninety points of a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando

online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nBut in addition to academics it's also looking at a particular um talents that a student might have outside of the academics like musical talent perhaps someone has done some pretty serious science research they are also looking at athletics and you know manning that sports teams\nI'm of course that legacy that are part of this and race is one of these factors particularly under represented groups African American ... like the you know Native American groups I'm kind of diverse uh make sure that those voices are part of the student body on campus to provide a diverse learning environment\nYou mentioned on the under represented groups you did not mention Asian Americans or legacy students that I'm Wondering why that was\nYes children of people who went to Harvard at some kind of ... get a kind of close to ... they get an extra read and you know they do get a small leg up\nAnd uh in terms of Asian Americans university denies that their penalizing Asian Americans\nIn the admissions process and what they think that they're trying to do in this case is to tie this question of are Asian Americans penalized views of the white\nTo our whites penalize these are the um underrepresented minorities I should say under the law there is a compelling state interest to give a boost to underrepresented minorities for this diverse environment\nThe Congress is not true between you know when we're comparing Asian Americans to whites and admissions\nWhy I wanted to come to you because you just wrote a big piece about this in the New Yorker you interviewed several Asian Asian American activists who actually are in support of the lawsuit can you give us a sense of why they feel that way why they stand there\nYeah I think there's a lot of division within the Asian American community it might not be as great as is often reported but there is a very small very vocal group within the Chinese American immigrant population that is very much invested in notions of opportunity meritocracy\nAnd you know they often spoke about the American dream in a way that I think a lot of people who've been in America while don't necessarily sort of see is contracts we'd binding and it just sort of this perfect storm Edward Blum is really interested in changing the cultural conversation around affirmative action around\nRace consciousness and a lot of the\nPredominantly I Would say middle class I'm fairly kind of well to do single issue Chinese American voters particularly in suburban areas they don't really experienced the diversity that a college campus might provide for them or you know they just see this as taking something away from them\nOkay guys hang on a second we've got to take a short break but we'll be
