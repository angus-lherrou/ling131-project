think\nThey love and all is here to tell us all about this he's the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway good to be with your ... so what is ... city oh Texas like\n... you know Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nAnd the reporters who hunter Hussein who spent some time in the summer down there found a place that really cut against these stereotypes and put a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on a cross border sister town in Mexico or in August ... Mexico and as a result quite literally people depend on the knock out for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there is such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there that were a border wall to be built um most of the people there feel as if the community would be\nNot only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that the debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there I ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty a\nNot a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going a quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else [noise]\nPoverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked\nIt helps a lot of very odd twist it in the story is that if you have a a an injury or if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere is only the most rudimentary basic medical care available in ... in ... and you have to rely on the hospitals and knock out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be a matter of fact to Texas a city that are minimum will be an hour away\nAnd if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by car so as a result of people feel very isolated a they feel that\nA Washington and the federal government in a way as not eating their concerns this is a place for up until a couple of years ago that many of the streets were unpaved him a city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nWhy is this now and it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative in effect for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and I even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there are certainly uh other\nCountries and daily necessities might be there to show health both in an acute situation but also to and\nAnd just keeping yourself a fed keeping your family fed and making sure that that you have the basics of vote of daily life this was a really the reality there and if it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were that to come to bear\nOn also seems to again also fly and then there and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities you know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country um and we'll be focusing on those throughout throughout the week but tell us why\nYou chose the places you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells a story that's different about the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump by as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market is at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well muscle underscore that but\nThere are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that they are struggling and might be an issue of education and we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell her\nIncredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where housing is such an issue on everyone's mind or no should I say the lack there of\nUh we go to a place like Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota where people feel incredibly disenfranchised all these places that\nWe may have only gone to sex but a representative of many other places throughout the country whether\nIt's the uh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that are struggling that that have a reality that goes against what to what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nWell we've got about a minute left and obviously we've just got a couple of weeks left before the midterm elections what could those elections mean for communities like for\nStudio office was happening with the backdrop of the mid term election and people have a choice to make their making it now in early voting in some states\nThey will certainly have the opportunity to to make that choice in November ... election days so for places like this are struggling they they face a big question to which is whether they want to participate or even if they can participate the reality for a lot of people\nIs simply when you're working three jobs and just trying to make ends meet and keep your head above the poverty line it's very difficult to participate in such a critical vote is the one that we're facing right\nNow they love and solace the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and editor of this new six part series it launches tomorrow and we'll have a link

space and time to create new work\nWithout having to have the burden of figuring out where our income is going to be derived from you know we don't have to find supplemental jobs to be able to do the work that we do we can actually just be the writer that we were sort of been pushing to be all of our career and\nMore recently has already carved out an impressive career for herself writing the Broadway bound musical and too proud about the temptations\nAnd serving in the writers' room for the Showtime series shameless she's also authored a series of place set in Detroit a city that is central to her identity oh\nI'm from Detroit and I was born and raised there and my husband's from Detroit and my family lives there and so for me Detroit as personal it's about family I always say that\nDetroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are looking at the city where sort of looking at\nThe social narrative a an air to around race in economics and our nation and stuff for me it's important to be writing about that in writing from a place of within a\nSo much love for the city because I have some family there and and I have such a really particular upbringing there and so I don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure\nAnd so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that cows more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plays a huge take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and on that very young ages and um it's something that it's become a huge problem in in the United states how do you take a topic like that\nAnd bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic well\nFirst of all I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which is a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships or\nTo teaching because of a it's a public school teacher and privacy with teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles and from my play pipeline is about looking at it through a mother who's trying to raise her son but also a mother who's a teacher and a public school so we get to see\nHer relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and his relationship to that private school system and we're looking at\nBasically ... within the two forms of education how institutions can fail children an educator both in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not\nHaving enough space for the total humanity and very motion advocacy is young especially young black and brown boys and our nation and so that was important for me to try to explore our producer\nWho was putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now as opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think\nYou were referring there to the opportunities that women of color specifically have within a the creative fields tell us a little

we're seeing that evidence then large and small way that our nation right now right leadership it comes from the top down and so um because that in theater and take a very ... it means\nProgramming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience or they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to\nHave a very diverse um background and for women of color to being more positions of power and where they are making those decisions I so I think we need to see a shift and that's the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just trying to say goodbye so off the stage because it it it's a time and the world while I feel that\nIt doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color in the audience there has to be a an entire collective shift\nThat invites audiences of diverse backgrounds into the house to have an experience together that's what makes the air special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\n... Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there's an assumption about what people call it will not spend their money on and that is ... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things that are there significant fall\nI think it is also it's about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something\nThat's what the or haven't figured out but I Do also think affordability of tickets it's a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially me talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means you cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house while I'm not that I can cook [laughter] I have my food\nSo it comes to your house and each of food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples like why would I spend money for it comes to your house to eat the food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to you have to rule me give me some samples to bring me out and show me that I'm\nNot just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship was that is the kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active about\nDominique Marie so as a playwright whose work includes skeleton crew and pipelines thank you so much though many thank you\nThat takes away we'll be right back I Want to bring up when he won the Nobel subscribe to the land the hard hats on June or wherever you and your body cast [noise]\n\nChina has become the biggest lender to government in Africa Chinese loans have bumped up debt to GDP ratio from fifty to eighty five percent so we're talking about a lot of money to try and\nI'm Ari Shapiro critics say many African countries are now at risk of a credit crisis that story this afternoon on all things\nConsidered from NPR News [noise]\n\nStray listening to solve the noon ad for for all things considered here or not he point seven\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from Florida Hospital where they are committed to a whole new way of health care on January second Florida Hospital become known as advent health with a belief that health care should be built around your life\nMinute before seven o'clock thanks for joining us for all things considered on Ninety point seven news stay tuned for fresh air that's coming up next you're listening to Ninety point seven W.
