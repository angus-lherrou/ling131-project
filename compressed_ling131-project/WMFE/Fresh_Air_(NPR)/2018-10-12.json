the power comes back on you that\nThere was a Florida Atlantic University study that ah coincidentally was released this week the ten counties in Florida that had the lowest level of evacuation readiness are in the panhandle and in North Florida they rated on six categories such a special needs registries pickup location plans maps and\nAnd plans for pet evacuation plan had her with her sister station in Tallahassee WFSU\nOr what's the the the the kind of quick assessment of the evacuation readiness especially in a storm like Michael that are clearly did not give people much time to prepare\nWell yeah people we've heard from people who said that\nThey didn't know it was going to be that bad um a lot of people did not have those evacuation orders and I've talked to people on the ground they now they wish they had um they have been critical really sort of some of the weather information that they got that you know we heard it was going to be a category two we heard it was going to be a category three and then oh my God at the cat for\nAnd that just really speak to how strong and how fast the storm came up and really some of the smaller community is it it's really important to know some of the small coastal communities are low income community if their cash based\nThey don't have a lot of people and that really affects how people can get out and really even if people could evacuate if they wanted to if you don't have a car you can't go anywhere and so that really uh you know contributes to the decision making of some of these people who\nGet on a lot of cases may have had no choice but to stay because they could not get out\nOr let's take a quick call in Miami lakes in South Florida Renee online to Renee I'm tied on time please make your comment quickly\nAll right that real quick here I'm building codes that are currently a enacted in Panama City in that area a look to what's ... what's available in Dade County and it was just so much difference between a date county code in Broward County but it's just you know there's no major knows no boundaries\nYeah certainly that is true those to South Florida counties a rare and click on time I'd want to get Bryan Norcross the chance to respond to that the Dade County South Florida coach were changed considerably in Ninety two or after the Ninety to uh Andrew\nEffective in October of Ninety four was a lot of work and the data Broward codes are not significantly different things with Robert code at the very top end is a tiny bit less but the codes in Bay county and the panhandle are drastically last and I think shameful they less than they are here in South Florida\nAnd how much less I mean the the the the wind code in South Florida homes must be built to withstand what kind of\nWent category for when and in the panhandle high end category too low and cat or a nominally a hundred and ten miles per se significant difference then in the in the Panama City right now in the

P. algae television in Miami formerly of the weather center is still with us and Kate Steinle the environmental and transportation reporter in South Florida\nFor W. al Ahram Brian I Want to circle back around to the forecasting of hurricane Michael we heard it in some of the phone calls in the last segment a concerns voiced about ah the accuracy of the forecast and it's a common criticism after a storm there's no doubt about it\nUm what's your kind of quick assessment about the accuracy of the cone and the accuracy of the intensity of hurricane Michael\nNow the bottom line is they had two days warning that are very bad hurricane was coming if you looked at the actual numbers ... was a category three hurricane forecasts that two days in advance\nAnd then you have to really turn to try to blind I not to see the trend following let all the scientists has been warning for years and\nI get pretty upset when I hear all these you know record destined hottest year on record in hottest December and worst storm and record storms ... and the news media and not\nRegularly making that connection for the public that doesn't know\nThat this is what we can expect as climate change intensified and I think that as as a as human beings I I don't understand how we can be so irresponsible not act as if this is the emergency that it is it whatever the fences which to renewable energy\nOn and get away from fossil fuel burning it's got to be less than ... billion if not trillions that we're spending on the storms and other people that are dying as a result of these disasters\nChoose not to let me let me put that to a couple of a professional communicator so that are with us here right now I'm a ... weather forecaster a meteorologist ended and environmental journalist what about the critique good that Susan has Brian about\nAh communicating in her estimation that connection between these kinds of ah of disasters and then the broader picture of climate change so let's let's\nSeparate or a couple of things one is if you thought about hurricanes in the Nineteen forties a category for hurricane hit a Miami Dade County Nineteen forty five a category for hit Broward in forty seven category for hitting Monroe and forty eight category for head to Palm Beach county forty\nNine strongest ever to hit the ... the same Nineteen thirty five and ... and another category\nFor his downtown Miami in Nineteen fifty so it's not with hurricanes that were suddenly seeing a lot of strong hurricanes what we're seeing is hurricanes hitting this spectacularly developed environment\nWhiz higher sea level\nNominally higher sea level you know on the order of a foot compared to what it was\nA back when all these hurricane started in the early twentieth century so that's one thing that makes saying this is a a global warming climate change issue quite so definite because in actual fact in our adult lives were all the adults listening\nWe are having more hurricanes because we went through a low when we were younger but in our grandparents lived there were actually a lot more so these things are to some degree system\nNot that's not at all to say that the heat waves and just a plain old heat that we feel the number of Ninety degree plus day in and the acceleration in an all the problems that come with that and the coral reef problems and all those things\nThat's a separate kind of threat so four boiling it down in an attribution in broadcasting is is a challenge to be\nAccurate but we have to think of them as both major threats\nAnd also from you know the perspective of someone who tries to be an empathetic journalists it can it can be hard to you know see this devastation and\nYou know be reporting from Miami on what's happening in the panhandle and feel a sense of not not guilty but you know is this really the appropriate time to be talking about climate change and\nGlobal warming and you know how that plays into our vulnerabilities to\nHurricanes through the warming of the oceans and through sea level rise and you know given some thoughts that and I feel like I mean when else isn't appropriate time you know our president he his position on climate change I think is pretty clear it's not something that he wants to talk about too maybe put it delicately\nBut and but he will eat knowledge you know that he keeps talking about these monster storm and so there's a news angle to that as\nWell let me remind folks that you are listening to the floor to round up from Florida public radio but\nThe thing is and it's challenging and I think is important is that if we over attribute\nThen we actually do more harm to the message of making people understand that it's that climate change is an existential threat to our lives in Florida because it gives people that want to be naysayers\nThings to hang our hat on to say well look they oversold it on that point I that's just a that's just the challenge of communications in this arena\nLend me another challenge is just having enough time Marion Vero Beach I Want to squeeze your phone call in before on a break here are just a couple of seconds married

feel like now is the time to talk about climate change just very brown\nFat or when you said that I found out a lot yeah [laughter] when when does it not a good time\nAbout it ... it bothers me when
