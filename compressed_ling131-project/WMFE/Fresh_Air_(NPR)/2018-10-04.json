Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nReally going to factor into elections across the south in these midterm elections\nThat Aaron Haynes whack and she's the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity and recently she's been reporting from rural counties in Georgia in part of what's called the black belt\nThe black belt is that what we know is the deep south which you know historically if where slavery thrived or where you know the wealth of the plantation system was created and obviously when slavery went away these became some of the most impoverished\nAreas in the country but the black belt is also where frankly the battle for voting rights for African Americans was was waged and so you know you think about Fannie Lou Hamer Ella Jo Baker Fred Shuttlesworth John Lewis these people weren't from Baltimore Cleveland or\nNew York you know they were from the deep south and they expanded that franchise for all and you know this is also the place where issues like voter suppression continuing persist today and so that's one of the reasons why it's really important to focus on these folks and how they're going to factor into November\nAnd you mentioned voter suppression um tell us a little bit about some of the other issues that are really top of mind for black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor\nThey struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have healthcare challenges specifically\nAs we know minorities often have health care disparities from diabetes to sickle cell to obesity but they don't necessarily have the access to health care that you would have\nSay in a city you can have dozens and dozens of churches for example but no hospitals for miles and miles and that's a real challenge for them and something\nSomething that has has not been addressed frankly by by the folks that that get elected in those parts of of the country a lot of times\nAnd in your piece you went to Georgia to report this out why did you choose that state\nWhat's yours was really really important because\nIn Georgia there is obviously a very a high profile ... contest where possibly be first African American woman could be elected governor in the country and that Stacey Abrams and Stacey Abrams actually started her campaign\nIn South Georgia where a lot of these black rural voters lists\nAnd the reason that that's important is because you know about a third of the rural folks in Georgia are people of color\nAnd so unlike other contest local contests for example that that may be\nDilute the power of people of color frankly because of of racial gerrymandering you know and a statewide contest these are the voters that can really be key to those kinds of victories and frankly you know what she has done go into a lot of these places that had been forgotten\nBy Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference in the in that contest and others in in the south where you have a large populations of black folks especially in rural counties\nAaron one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that\nWell one thing that's important to think about for these folks is\nBecause they felt like they they they were electing people who were forgetting about them kind of in between election times you know they they were they were\nVoting for people who then did not come back and give them like I said the economic development that they were looking for or the health care\nThat they need and so they felt like at least in these off presidential year elections that their vote didn't count you know you've got now\nFolks who look like they're running in more of these places are in in in several these counties that I went to you have incumbents who you know been in office for years in some cases even white conservative lawmakers at the local level\nRepresenting majority black counties and and I wondered you know how is that possible well these people have gone unchallenged\nFor so long or people you know have not paid attention to those local level elections and so these people have stayed in office but but now that starting to change if folks are starting to get more engaged in these local uh down ballot races and realizing that that they can also make a difference\nRight and and what's interesting also is that I interviewed therapists marsh is a journalist and a couple of weeks ago and she was talking about how white progressive rural voters\nFeel that their perspectives have been forgotten in the Trump country narrative freight did rural black voters also feel like they were being left out of the media narrative or was that just something that wasn't even a concern for them\nNo I think it definitely is a concern because you know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it meant a lot of and not have their heads in agreement I you know they're not in front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmers I mean black people have never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distance\nFrom that narrative is is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that's foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in cities and maybe you know either don't have relatives are aren't getting back\nTo to that part of the country to see family or friends it doesn't always occur to folks that yes there are black people living in rural areas in and quite a lot of them frankly\nI'm curious if you think there could be the potential for coalitions to be formed between say more progressive white rural voters and rural black voters who might be able to see some opportunities there for cross pollination if you will of ideas or is that just is it too early to tell right now\nWell you know I think it's entirely possible and I say that because again when you're in a small place like that you know these are folks that are interacting\nSo much I mean not to suggest that there are still places like that where there there is segregation and people are living in different parts of town but the town is so much smaller than say a big city and so these are folks that really do\nKnow each other you know I I think of a recent campaign stop the stay the aim sat down and plains Georgia which is the hometown of former President Jimmy Carter\nAnd you know the idea that the two of them would be on the campaign trail together President Carter has endorsed her they're talking about rural health care that's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters\nAnd black rural voters and so you know understanding that they do have shared interests I I think does present an opportunity for just that kind of coalition that you talk\nAbout [noise] Erin ... the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity Aaron thanks for joining us\nSo much for your reporting on this topic thanks very much for having me I Know it's difficult ... full as a staff writer at the Marshall project and she and Emily Cassie co produced the banished support [noise]\nAnd\nThis is Debbie ...\nThank you for joining us today whether maybe a couple of passing clubs and showers from time to time today when the temperatures are going to climb again your little lower nineties we had a little break here for about a couple of hours the range of just drop even more for friday you sort of a week before pick it up early next week no change really temperatures\nExpect to drop Saturday a little more reasonable next week you much good ocean conditions are on the rocks are doodle is long distance will all this weekend\n\nThis is the takeaway I'm tending to Vegas when a woman is a victim of domestic violence finding a way out is not easy for immigrant\nWomen especially those who are undocumented things can be even more complicated in fact immigrant women are nearly twice as likely as the general population to experience domestic violence\nThese women may not be aware of the legal options available to them or those options themselves may be limited many of them say they fear deportation if they contact\nAuthorities over the last several decades a secretive network of let the nuts has sprung up in California to help those suffering from domestic abuse women who have actually opened their homes at shelters for abused when\nThe pressure is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine and she reported on this underground network of women giving abused immigrants safety companionship and even medical and legal advice\nPresser says there are about one hundred and fifty other Latino women nationwide doing work similar to what she saw in California and she told me about one of the women she followed in her reporting\nSo limiting Valentino and she's opening her home in one of the women who who she is working with as a woman who I call self yeah um she has been in an abusive relationship for many years and for a while she was struggling to leave because she was nervous about\nThis going public with her story at all since Trump was elected she became much more nervous about the threat of deportation and in particular about losing her children and so\nShe came to Valentino house and stay for a week and now Valentino sees her regularly to check in on her and she understands that this is a long process right now the average an average woman tries seven times to leave her\nI'd be surprised that in this country when your number one that can be even more difficult\nWhat is a you visa and how does it play into the conversation we're having\nI'll step back a little bit of violence against women act as first passed in Nineteen Ninety four and at least the first federal legislative package that was designed to end violence against women\nAnd it included a piece of legislation that provided a path to permanent residency for abused and the women who spouses where their abusers and who are also us at a center permit matched it they're really small fraction immigrant women\nIn two thousand and that but the reauthorization of the parents' hands on an act that was expanded and do you eat that was created and offered a path to permanent residency\nFor immigrant women who were victims of violent crime and who are willing to\nHelp with the investigation and prosecution of that kind of bipartisan legislation so the ... is that where does it stand today\nIn the past four years have seen an enormous backlog in tiny fourteen the government was granting visas to him and who had applied five months earlier if you apply today evil eight nine years crazy as in a hundred and twenty thousand person pack locks that are kept at ten thousand a year\nI'm In the same timeframe you've seen the number of educators drop from Ninety three to sixty at the last official tally\nWhy is there such a delay and is that delay what spring these women in part to seek services quote unquote underground it's hard to understand\nWhy there's such a delaying why there hasn't been surprised at an addition of educators to help speed up the process\nIt's a good question about whether that delays driving people under God of course we don't know causation necessarily but definitely the woman who I was speaking to her opening their homes were finding that survivors who came to them just didn't want to wait nine years they couldn't wait nine years right\nSo that means that for nine years they don't have the protection of award private said they can't necessarily support their children and that's what the result is designed to do to to give people a pathway to residency so that they would be able to leave safely and to support their families and\nYou know the Obama administration I'm happy you know had very controversial policies regarding immigration I'm Wondering are these would have been more concerned under today's circumstances under the Trump Administration or is there equal concern under the Obama administration if so what's the difference today I was wondering\nThe same thing and I was actually I'm somewhat surprised to learn that the concern is much mutt\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations ... served central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nActually under the Obama administration\nDidn't feel as ... as risky to come forward to the police they felt as if Obama's deportation priorities were much clear and now those priorities have been widened so broadly that they really just don't know\nOne of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting was fat women felt particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news in this way that they believe that it's possible that their family too could be separated\nWhen these women come to Valentino do they end up staying just temporarily do they end up going back to their abusive partners like what have you seen\nYeah so and you know it estimates that about half of the women who have stayed with her have gone back to their partners it's really really difficult police\nAnd a half at last some stay for a night some stay for two months so it really depends on the woman and Valentino is feeling is it's up to them and she'll do what what works best for them I mean I've met I met some women who are opening their homes you found that the survivors stayed with them for as long as a year\nOne of the problems at the shelter system is that there's an expiration date um if you are if you are lucky enough to find a better than a sheltered extremely hard to do\nYou often have six year Ninety Days maximum and then you have to get out and so these them and feel like at least they can do is kind of the extent that day why does the network need to be a secret\nSome of the women don't necessarily call it a secret and would actually speak about it more publicly others feel as if it's too risky to say I'm bringing in women whose\nPartners are abusing them because they feel as if it's a possibility that if you will ban come after them so many of them had kids living with you know and they're trying to protect their families now trying to protect our communities\nAnd in part because the survivors themselves\nWant to disappear they feel as if they can't get a restraining order I don't feel safe going to the police they can't get a restraining order they don't want to live in the same city just their abusers they prefer to move to a different town and start a new life and so they would prefer if their location was secret and for the women who are opening their homes respect to honor that is there anything\nWe should be thinking about culturally because we're talking about Latinos in particular are there any uh cultural distinctions that come up and dealing with domestic violence\nThere's so much work that needs to be done at ground level just to get women to feel comfortable talking among people who they know about what's going on in their home or what's going on in

we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer at an ... he has a piece in the magazine called ghost in the machine about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook and its current controversies it's in a recent issue\nNow Facebook has done a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors you know give us an example [noise] this is a big\nChange for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who is Facebook's first president he's sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he'd become a conscientious objector to social media you said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth a vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said [noise]\nYou know in the back of our minds we all had a sense that something might be going wrong with our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call external and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decrease sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they're trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is Annette ... and the company has been done to acknowledge it you heard for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling would glazed eyes hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you\nAnd so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that any more\nYou talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that is he regard this kind of experimentation\nWell he absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he hasn't in some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data to be a uh to to get out into the world\nI'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond its comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had a civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary members of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being\nBold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm he\nDid and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel\nThe same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nA and people so that's that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states it's it's really embedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people\nFurther there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be aggressively\nTransparent in order 'em to be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private solves in our public solves but that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed\nThat being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and they're they're monitored their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world\nNow almost like redefining what it is to be him [laughter]\nThey believed that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you have this\nFor Ninety planes or the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for filtering had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nRace that wholeheartedly [noise] there was a recent data breach a Facebook were fifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this\nThis is a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other cases like Cambridge Analytica was that this was outright fast this was a case of hackers or hacker we still don't know who it was I'm\nFinding essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million Facebook user accounts Facebook also\nI'm to be safe or took another forty million users and kick them off the force them to log back in so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control\nOf the account so ah there they were able to get control of your privacy settings they could go into your messages they could post things on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals' if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied history ... what is it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would have they would have\nProbably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this breach or really before they know very much about it so it's it's raises many questions as its answer at this point\nWe're listening to the interview fresh as Dave Davies included with Evan ... a staff writer for the New Yorker I've noticed this article about Facebook is titled goes through the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy we'll hear more of the interview after a break\nAnd Terry Gross and this is

in Facebook ghost in the machine was in a recent issue of the magazine\nSo when word began to emerge about the spread of false information on Facebook or some of it by ... by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency in Russia um how did sucker bird respond to this\nHe rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might've affected the outcome of the two thousands sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were and\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they\nInitially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation ... and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin\nHad fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project and yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout their powers of priests\nFor Ninety planes or the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for building had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings of horrible on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nThat they have not had this dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged that from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's why I'm so companies in big trouble ... Berg\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do\nWell there was a lot riding on that appearance or you know in many ways it kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and there was growing calls for regulation and\nHe in some ways is vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point Orrin Hatch senator from Utah said to mark sucker birds like if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\nSecretary kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads if it was such an obvious fact to anybody who's paid attention to technology that it really I think underscored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same as everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known\nA adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success they they just stumbled on something that was\nI'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye career you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this\n[noise] it's become this consuming effort a Facebook over the last year as a as a controversy has grown they've undertaking one initiative after another so when it comes to political election uh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued that we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ads\nWe are going to not only do that but we are going to go farther than TV does we're going to let users to be able to click on an ad and then no not only who paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for and and who were they targeting um they're also saying we're going to\nDo more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially\nUm misinformation it's distributed to try to shake elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in in many ways Dave it's almost like they've put a gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire people who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials who are are in one case there was an Iranian campaign to try to spread misinformation but what we don't know and really won't know until after\nThe midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working um and I think what's interesting is so Facebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it find examples of disinformation will announce it will say we took down a group of\nRussian uh imposter who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um\nBut that's either a sign that they're winning the battle or it's a sign that the battle has grown so much that they're going to continue to face this and and what I'm struck by is how much\nThe integrity and the credibility of elections now rests on the shoulders of individual employees inside a private company in California that's a very unusual situation for our democracy to be in\nBecause they can actually make distinctions above what what the public sees and what doesn't\nYes yeah I mean they have to make very subtle choices will take for example the\nYou know misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when it's somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers of public those kinds of very subtle things which are usually the province of the Supreme Court or of lawmakers are now being handled in conference rooms at Facebook and it's very complicated\n[noise] Evan us most is a staff writer for the New Yorker whose piece the ghost in the machine about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook appeared in recent issue we'll
