journalists being targeted in general [noise]\nSo what I Would say is it's not ... female unless a targeted disproportionately because that John List I think what we've got to look out here is the way in which women are targeted\nDisproportionately with threats of abuse threats have rape harassment jokes thing and the like\nAcross the board not just in general is and now\nThat the thing about journalism is that women in journalism tend to be relatively well known in the high profile journalist I Am a done this myself we need to be in the public high we need to be known to people say that they feel that they can approach us with\nStories out bylines are on newspapers up pictures unknowns people if where a broad causes on television\nSo people are aware of who those women on whether they target them because they've done less well because the women it's less clear\nI think what is clear is that people are increasingly feeding able to have a go at journalists in part because of the environment that's being created by politicians and others in criticizing done this publicly and that the public in general\nA largely men feel they are able in particular to Target Women with\nDrilling nasty threats and we'll see set and he's saying that on the rise\nTell us a little bit about the role here of social media in particular show so obviously in the past it was more challenging to contact gymnast you how to write a letter or even coal Adonis now it's much easier to target people in general\nAll of us put out probably falls often out there in the public so it's easier for people to get in touch with us they don't need to know\nOur phone number they need to know the address a home addresses the address of the newspaper they can contact us all mice directly what that's done on the one hand\nI think the Internet has been a great thing for journalism and democracy in general it's enabled those who didn't have a voice previously to voice their opinions that concerns\nThat criticism but also what it's allowed people to do with feel that they can\nPublicly beret criticized and in some cases abuse and harass people with whom they disagree I think it's less clear how fall the abuse of messages on line translates into any real intention to commit violence we had about the three women that you mentioned\nBut it's unclear how fall\nThe people who are sitting in the homes feeling that it's fine to abuse women online actually have any intention of carrying out nevertheless it doesn't stop at having an impact it easy I think for people to say oh just suck it up pick nor it\nBut ... knows what it is like to be on the receiving end of hundreds of thousands of messages\nThreatening you and your family is and and I think that's something that we don't often talk about it's not just that some of these threats real or not\nUm two women are not just about saying I wasn't going to attack you I Wish you would be raped and so on it will say that often people's families a threat to and and that gives any boats have male female I think great pool is about how far they want to carry on\n[noise] you know what's interesting is that the three cases we're talking about here all happened in Europe and I'm Wondering if that tells us anything about what the environment is like for journalists there\nI think it does I think one of the things that we have new test most in our monitoring of media freedom in Europe in recent years an index on censorship is the way in which the environment has changed for journalists generally and I think in part that's because\nPoliticians those in power have in Naples docked environment we have the president of United States but not just the president of the United states a number of politicians throughout Europe who are openly voicing criticism of the media\nFor anything that they don't like enemies of the people fake news and that creates an environment I think in which the profession is devalued and which

Michael and in a few weeks voters will be taking to the polls for mid term elections\nAs Rick Scott's term ends a crucial race for governor is heating up Democrat Andrew Gillum is facing off against GOP candidate Ron defenses and voters are closely watching how each candidate is handling the hurricane response effort [noise]\nThirty and will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of the three states alone with Iowa and Kentucky that permanently take the vote away from convicted felons\nAnd there are questions about whether people who haven't voted during the last three elections but emerged during the\nPrimaries will turn out again David Smiley has been covering all of this is the Miami Herald political reporter David welcome back to the takeaway\nThings around me so there's a lot going on in Florida as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how is a storm like Michael affecting or could it affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWhere Michael hit a interestingly is a heavily Republican area and it really wiped out um a lot of the roads the uh infrastructure so immediately we're\nSeeing questions about will those counties in the Florida Panhandle be ready to vote for early voting on Monday and for election day so that'll be interesting to watch or they aren't the most\nPopulous counties but that seems like it might affect Republican turnout um and just generally the hurricane has kind of reset\nThe table for the campaigns you know there were topics that were heavily in the media before the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and\nThose issues like the economy and red tide were pretty quickly drowned out by hurricane Michael and um the devastation that caused in the ongoing recovery so I think it may change some state wide focus\nFrom voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as\nGovernor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson N. is heavily involved in recovery efforts in as Andrew Gillum or had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm around dissent is no longer a congressman\nTrying to ship his campaign to remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nDo we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he's had to sort of take step aside to handle the hurricane or is this a campaign still going\nThe polls the recent polls have showed give them with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out this morning the really the first poll a taken dish to potentially\nShow hurricane effect and it still had given ... plus one um I I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily\nOn the the media rotation during and after the storm were dissenters didn't have a invested role in the recovery and the preparations\nAre so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or weeks or to see whether we'll see any other shift but in a state like Florida where top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point uh I don't think we're going to see either\nAndrew Gillum more rounded chances are ahead or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridians to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\nWell late last month we saw the University of north for to pull that had a ballot measure its Seventy one percent support to get on the ballot or the backers of amendment for uh pursued a petition drive\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early in the health dot com slash kids\nUm but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass a a ballot question and I I Do think one there is a campaign against it\nAnd to be we're going to see some skepticism from people who either may not totally understand what the image speaks to do and the fact that I'm a convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole in order to have their rights restored and then there'll be questions from voters about the\nTo what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for um people who are convicted\nCertain non violent offenses are and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that the Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices um who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will affect um the liberal majority\nWell right on the southern member court there are three of of four\nJustices who have kind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc\nAnd have at times ruled against Rick Scott\nThey are due to age limits are stepping down um the day that the next governor is sworn in and\nGiven that that decision will now falls to either Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas and they have such divergent opinions on what the court should look like that seems likely to to energize\nA they're voting base is I I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to\nIssues of the higher courts and the significance of it and we did see some a speculation that perhaps the Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S Supreme Court might have actually a given Rhonda stand just a bump who was trailing pretty consistently in the polls\nBy decent margin or and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that controversy energized\nFor the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with the census over Trump or or or any other issues and I'm In that might have given him a bump so\nProbably better for the Centers for Gillum but certainly Planned Parenthood or abortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I I don't think that\nYou know a liberal voters are just going to have their shoulders and think about it there's\nNever a dull moment in Florida David Smiley from the Miami Herald thanks so much for being with us [noise] they do\n[noise]\nWe want you to be part of the

is an over the course of the first season it was going to reveal itself to the audience as being something more\nAnd and darker and more interesting and kind of a goal was by the time you get to the end of the first season you're thinking oh my God I care about these characters ... when this\nHappened they they tricked me um and so that transition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one that we really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse as bright and powerful it just takes on a different feel\nAnd you can kind of sneak attack into sadness and some fun surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack into sadness incidents\nIn some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter] and and\nJak isn't such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a lazy suicide attempts right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability well he's not actively\nKilling himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... maybe minor distinction to us that he is so distorted and despairing that he's willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side and he's not trying to\nPaper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak\n[noise] I I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and just as well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on this TV show called horsing around cheers you to hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her just as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these ... and early on the network has no maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not reliable but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to learn for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Libya's birth mother comes to do it she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be the live your life you're getting it of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya or they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway that we're supposed to be careful\nMoms have a way of letting you do but Libya\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nThe network really juiced because they're ... for good\nBut of course because it's a TV show smack on for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse there to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rise from Mr T. alpha ... stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do\nSupport for Ninety

like after the eulogy episode I would've thought that you were a bitter mantle at a very troubled childhood\nReading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell your\nParents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell me about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob\nAnd it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto in the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit to the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit on her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews it never felt\nOr extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce so it's like a minority in the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store often it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of money that we're chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah just as\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end of the the misfit toys Hanukkah um it it's just over a normal that to have a Jewish wife\nAre meant to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAre you now officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set up because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years they'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out that I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate in long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy are pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just\nA shout out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I\nHave I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference between you know the problem with ADHD and other\nA mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precise\nSupport for Ninety points of a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ...
