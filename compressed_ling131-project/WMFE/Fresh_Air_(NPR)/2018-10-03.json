Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nFrom the report detailed signs of tax evasion and very likely tax fraud involving\nSham corporations undervalued real estate holdings in schemes to avoid inheritance taxes in total one billion that's billion with a beat dollars in wealth was transferred from the Trump parents to the Trump children\nInstead of paying fifty five percent of tax on those funds the times investigation found that Trump's pay just five percent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJedi Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud\nThere certainly parts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance our tax minimization that is perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that that you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud innovations work quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory um despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump\nTo help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm it pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies\nBut in the times investigation they found that basically it was a shell company with a company on paper and they would mark up the cost of products as a way of transferring the money is unpack skiffs is that tax fraud\nI Believe that it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true\nThis is tax fraud and one of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no economic substance it was nearly a way of funneling gifts from the president's father or to the president has siblings\nOne or the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties\nAnd according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's Nineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed at twenty five apartment complexes he owned were valued at forty one point four million\nBut the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that tax fraud\nIt's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur and the kinds of discounting that as is actually appropriate and in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nSo you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value is probably wrong\nBut it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing evaluations done by another expert as of the same approximate date we're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time\nI Would say that that does valuations are highly likely to be wrong but whether it and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nI guess the question that this is sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\n[noise] yeah I\nI think wealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be yeah I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year if when you die you have more than a eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attacks to is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nIn a state tax you know it's I it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay a and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules were not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us who pay our taxes and don't you know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seem to be able to get around us\nI think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax with a state tax none of the rest of us pay estate tax do the wealthy pay estate tax yes significant portions of it and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay\n... and what is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the amounts and whether the violation of allies willful and you know the IRS has a whole set of penalties that that they used to apply\nBased on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax returns\nJay Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago Johnny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you

we talked about it [noise] my advance\nMaternal age my old eggs in one of the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise your sperm it's like on a sabbatical\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose not\nSo that was Catherine hon and Paul Giamatti and as seen from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life so did\nYou have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my and get her ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started I understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori is time ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nTo pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly she feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and the thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available\nTo her I think for a lot of women when you're trying\nTo reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of\nBecoming I mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that do go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very consuming and not\nConducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life which opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday after a break we'll talk more about trying to have a

Giamatti and Catherine hon who are in their forties and trying to conceive through various\nFertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and sons of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and you raise you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was many many other character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and\nI and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his suit and and had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and\nHe was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia and part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there isn't a strange men need\nBetween you know between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so that is unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies\nIs um is family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well Parenthood during that time has made you so focused\nYou know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I\nMust be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we live with their mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot\n[laughter] what what is your mother arrangements um when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm\n... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and I was working at dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um she was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school\nAnd did I Want to move with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it\nBecause I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother [laughter] you know getting a PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and do we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't\nSupport for Ninety point of a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ...
