highest levels of the Saudi\nGovernment with me on the line is Carlotta Gall the assembled bureau chief for the New York times for a lot of thanks for joining us pleasure to be with you can you remind our listeners who could show he is and why he was being targeted by the Saudi Government\nSo he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing for a lot of us who knew him\nOver the is was that he was well connected to the government he had served in the government you become a spokesman for some senior officials so for us we knew him that way\nAnd then lately he taken up a\nPoster with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia on bases set up in self imposed exile in his in his criticism had increased so he was a real so on and the side as we see clearly now with the states\nAnd you've been speaking to sources within the Turkish government Carlotto what are the new developments here\nSo we've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and they talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very\nFrom sign from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public that clearly giving it to John honest to publish that those two groups of Saudi that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn to the second over a week ago and these officials that came flew in on private planes on the left the same day I'm\nUsually the Saudi officials are Turkish officials\nSaudi officials Fifteen of them on two separate planes they came in in in a different times that day and they left the same day and the ... officials are saying they were a century I hit squad they were responsible\nFor killing him this membrane his body and somehow disposing of it so the the the mystery remains the investigation the types of now\nMounted an investigation they're asking for access to the consulate which of course is diplomatic ... trees so that uh also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details are gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among all that equipment we know they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy of a consummate building putting them and they'll call\n'em we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um those even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the promises to it\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all and the United states obviously has close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of the disappearance or really foul play and the talks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi

D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see often that you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or crew or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it on that if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense than\nThan the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaky will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by\nExtension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the a dictionary in Haitian and just physical jostling of all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin Ryan in the capsule that you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw lap and question [laughter] not\nNot that I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to a\nLesser ... what did we ain't getting ... from we we\nHave to take a we had to take a moment\nNo he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise to type of actor who really just you know really wants to do as much with himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospitals for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nWell I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with or just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this was freaking machinery kind of a uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the downs you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves and the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nLittle drones and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them but this is this is a piece by piece a hand built\nMachine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts arts something better just delivered from the future you know their piece together by robots by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nNational puts together a press state meant about the death of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically standing as astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't ... I guess they don't ... preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you could find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a band of mood disaster um and ah what sort of you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nKaren Hi to place ... is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again but you can find online and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know thank thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there is some part of another world is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nUh lived their lives and in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nMy guest is ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la

boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film\nAnd I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that a kid arouse think uh uh obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it and we show it several times to flex standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe the physical sticking up the rod into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely the better choice not a political one to a focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't the things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process where we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was the product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nSupport for Ninety

man starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the moon I Want to ask\nYou about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's any music he actually brought with him to play after the space finding my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to yes yeah yeah yeah so it's it's a ...\nPiece called lunar Rhapsody yup and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of resentment that's been described as exotic I but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your ... to the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nRomney version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I asked somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually sitting there Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks of music that a bit Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but it's you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was a having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing and mission control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOh [noise]\nOh [laughter] oh\nReally\n[noise]\n\n\nSupport for Ninety point have neither comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location sit there and central Florida family more information including locations that Eileen Dole health dot com slash kids\nA land and where did it too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise] um and I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but la la land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan uh to talk to him about first man ah and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until all the way it's kind of languishing you know life it was sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so the I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned below and\nBut as soon as I like it was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like fresh man which there's so much technical stuff you have to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real ... miniature as it's it's it's\nYou know la la land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences and it's just like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing that\nA N and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film but they were are going to the end they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nYou mentioned al thank you so much for attacking us that's been great to have you back on
