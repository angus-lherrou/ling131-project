crusts or customers request something like that except this has to be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations during the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is to attacks content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who is behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels in the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy is an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that ah say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of this effort is somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin ... man who was you know that sort of the fact or ruler of the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these trolls were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a hashtags that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes in a way unreasonable\nThey also tried to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics so if there's a hashtags that picks up or there's some cases it may have actually been created created by them\nThey can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that\nAnd don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia\nAgain this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers or government owned there's not a lot of public engagement or civil society they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this is this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they're able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they don't they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who you know our trolls are called air sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media to base of trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trading list on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective\nAnd um they they they end up playing a real social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media doesn't any country\nBut the the differences Saudi Arabia so if they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they get on Twitter they can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them of perceived their own their own government\nYou reported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person\nWell we know that there was the Saudi engineer Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then basically tipped off by American law enforcement is that we have suspicions about this person that he hasn't been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using has access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because I'm ... death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns was he not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat in English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou also so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like to have that many followers just on his own Twitter channels so they put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots of lots of comments lots and lots of abuse and\nAnd and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list the players were\nYou know trying to influence the way that the content he was putting out as being received by people\nOr we should also be clear that Twitter as a company has been under fire\nFor a while now for what it allows it doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls when people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they ah said anything about all this has some from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or how their platform is being used in this instance\nI'm not aware of any direct response from Twitter to the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they tried to do this there was you know they put out of information\nA few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of bomb network I think they called it that they had taken down that was sort of a pro pro Saudi Bach network that Twitter had taken down\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when um Twitter executive speak about this they say you know well we wouldn't want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I I mean I think for Twitter they they're trying to find a balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are nefarious\nThan Hubbard is the ... bureau chief for the New York times

I. E. A. dot or\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nIt when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there is this element there was always one\nOne guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your\nTop off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does that ever work for you is any woman ever been like\nOh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like he just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about oh you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching sang times oh my God so I Know there's the light O L o ever\nPresent or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white man\nI Would have flashes like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night is also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd certainly in other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I now that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films\nAnd has been an attempt to make sure that you can act in material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant I was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOrlando Health network a pediatrician they're
