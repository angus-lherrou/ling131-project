of our ground is not a deal is\nThere's a big discrepancy in St Louis and economy that President Trump likes to boast a stronger than ever and the stagnant under class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads that is what will teach the beach I'm a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity found in her reporting\nIn St Louis especially in the city of about twenty six point seven percent of the people there are living below the federal poverty level it's very difficult if you are very low or extremely low income to find each affordable housing and specially if you need assistance\nThe last time the city opened its housing choice Fouchier commonly known as section eight months in twenty fourteen so will you habits of people waiting years hoping that they'll be able to receive a voucher\nFor housing that will accommodate them and their children I'm there also are waiting list for a public housing in the city and the county as

for her and her youngest daughter Michael Brown was killed by police officer and that housing complex and it's just\nA two minute drive away and she had worked for most of her time as an adult down at least I went back to her work history back to two thousand and so she is technically checking off the personal responsibility boxes that\nPresident Trump and Carson I have said are ways to get out of this system by at the end of the day it's just not enough she does make money she does technically an above the state's minimum wage jobs seven eighty five\nBut even with that it's it's hard for her to make ends meet because as soon as she got her job at um a local nonprofit in St Louis before she got her first paycheck her rent had increase\nSo I get paid by the minute they completely ... who are not receiving any child or [noise] I work every day for their trees\nI mean they they made a problem like this is supposed to be sent me some of the family says reservations where they do not let me say this and there's no way to get off I was literally probably\nShe's essentially not able even with her current employment able to even get off of section ... housing right now because money is just too tight\nIs the housing situation that you're describing where there's limited housing available and long wait times for section ... vouchers is that being exacerbated by gentrification at all\nI think when it comes to public housing and section eight housing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sense a through my reporting is that\nThe housing authorities are wander highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nInto it can be difficult to find landlords you want to accept\nA section eight housing choice voucher holders because of all the stigma that come with that really that's racism or whether that's your fear that they may not care for the property\nAnd also for the landlord a there is a long process of paperwork and inspections that goes into whether or not you choose to be a section eight lamb or so\nI think it's a lot of bureaucracy at play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing\nWell let's also talk about um what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson a HUD secretary who are essentially ... did a twenty Fifteen rule\nThat require communities that receive Hod funding make an effort to integrate their neighborhoods where does that steps\nIn the Nineteen fifties and the Nineteen sixties there was a wave of white flight to the suburbs and what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it's pretty much predominantly black\nSo there is concerned that there will be more division because of the undoing of this rule because it's no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your communities\nThe president has said that the war on poverty is largely over a desire to reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually um when I was visiting various communities especially along north side\nPeople just pointing around saying hey look at this look at all these in the house is look at all these abandoned homes nobody is coming here and people are concerned about how they're going to make ends meet and that economic prowess and\nGrowth that Trump sees for America doesn't really reconcile with what I saw in much of the city\nOn some level I feel like okay this is true and I we can survive something like this mostly come out of it on the other end\nThriving definitely makes me appreciate relationship I have been in my life and at the end of the day we have all of the really important stuff I feel like

are trying to close a big representation gap but that heightened visibility comes with a different set of challenges in late August coyote more is the only black woman in Vermont legislature dropped

office but\nThere's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black women to run for office well I think it is um\nYou know this confluence of events that we aren't that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generations you know thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women have been in black women have been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency we're seeing the attempts and in many cases the actual reality of the roll back so the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community so I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined with\nUh the electorate realizing that you know over eighty percent of our elected officials across the country are white and male and that is you know by no means represents the diversity in this nation the electorate as saying you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues\nAh regardless of you know the fact that they're blackie they can appeal to everybody and it has really been a great um catalyst for all of these women to run such strong primaries and you know we really looking forward to some great pickups on November sex\nSo let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically in and we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as we mentioned to funding and and getting support here\nUm yesterday in the show we talked about how important black women are to the Democratic party they've been called the backbone of the Democratic party Ninety percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and yet they still lacking representation and the party's leadership one of the guests that we had raised this notion of viability of black women candidates\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think black women candidates are thought of by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them the support what is that about um I think\nExactly it ice higher heights was born out of the notion that we needed a space for a black woman a political home for black women and go into a car and I we knew from our experience that the factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterparts\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happened for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic selves uh to the campaign trail has really been a a great factor in the

about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast son people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual object I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like asked means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to talk to somebody now\nA yes you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means among women or a grown are pulling off clothes etcetera and\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOrlando Health

perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens mean sexes something days ... folk and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people nuts part in the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question um the really hard to be an extra question ...\nYou read that the strongest argument for affirmative comes down for yes means yes it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when he me\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until they ended up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once you're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little\nDorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may recently\nYou know guys try to come up and down with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I didn't want his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get consent and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nWas that the first time that happens here\nThat was definitely for ... for me I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I married um I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who

electric lung this self object vacation isn't that just a\nA reasons it isn't that to some we're justifying um this kind of\nWay that you were you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of the students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up with these kids I interviewed in college just graduating now\nYou know Brittany spears was just like\nIf they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with so\nThey don't have the same idea about oh if I dressed to swing it makes me look like a slug because this is the way people dress now there's such a casual way and you're right in a lot of concerts as a beyond say or\nKaty Perry ... you know it's it's crossing a line way from scanty to something makes really sexual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nA huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised them like their social media posts six at rest there's there's a flipside to that but they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves\nShe read in your book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom an area where feminism has previously not been able to reach\nSo attached to explain what you mean by that I think that is raising of ... that has been going on with me to era is alone women not only to save these are the things that happened to me in the past that I might cause actual assault or I might just called things I was extremely uncomfortable with and now going\nInto the future I Want to be treated differently in the bedroom I Want to be asked what I Want I Want to be able to stay no tonight and have that actually
