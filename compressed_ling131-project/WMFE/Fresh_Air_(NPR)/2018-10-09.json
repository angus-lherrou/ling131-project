and the devastation brought back painful memories from just two years earlier when Hurricane Matthew tore through the area the first category five Atlantic hurricane in nearly ten years\nFor residents of lumber to North Carolina in rural ... county the devastation was inescapable\n[noise] [noise] it affected every word for it [noise] [noise] [noise] ... it affected everybody for what they don't understand it God made forty nights afford it but\nIt was just deja vu for these residents the damage was just horrible\nThat's actually ... a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and I talked to her about reporting in Lumberton and whether or not residents stories were reflected in the rosy economic picture touted by the Trump Administration\nLumber ten North Carolina it's a it's one of the most diverse rural counties in the country actually um you have about a third white a third black third lumpy Native American and a growing Hispanic population so it it's a very interesting kind of make up there\nNow of course we're looking at the series through the sort of idea that the president of the United states has recently and said that we solve the war on poverty that were good when it comes to poverty but Lumberton is actually one of the poorest and on healthiest and most dangerous counties in North Carolina tell us about what that looks like\nYeah so I visited twice or the summer and this fall first to kind of see what the town looked like after being hit by Hurricane Matthew twenty sixteen and you could still see a lot of the destruction from that long ago you would see\nPiles of sand that had come from one to the river that people hadn't cleared out I'm Still some furniture laying out some houses that just were very dilapidated in some areas where they had already torn down the entire house and there was just a green space\nAnd what about the impact of Hurricane Florence\nYeah so they got pummeled again I'm almost two years to the day um which\nWas just horrible because when I was there in July you would still see all the destruction but I was talking to a lot of people who are finally getting their lives back together um one woman I saw her the day that she got into her new home that was just rebuilt\nAnd then Florence head and the same thing happened all over again her houses was flooded and I heard that story time and time again\nAnd are there any people or groups in particular that these residents would like to see more from I'm Wondering about FEMA um or any other organizations theme is\nFound them ground Red Cross has been on the ground there was an issue with Hurricane Matthew with HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government was actually distributed so people are saying well okay the money hasn't calm that time around ... and that's two years later so what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how would how is that going to work\nSo Chris Howard the lumberjack resident we heard from earlier echoed those same concerns and trying to get help rebuilding his house\nAbout it but now it just getting medication state [noise]\nWe don't know what was going to get out there telling me that [noise] for for Eric\nRich default match\nI talked to many residents that one either or to discourage to even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it denials are very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again but that's really discouraging to residents\nOne person that I spend a lot of time with a stand Powell she actually went back and forth with FEMA twelve different times talking to different\nRepresentatives having to tell her story again hearing conflicting things you need this piece of information you need this to the point where she just gave up on that process so the recovery for a lot of people that need it the most that were really hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members\nThe system isn't really working from them and the way that it's meant to\nThis is a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty is over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton also\nAt the time but it was very interesting I\nAs I said before just showing up matters and during the hurricane a lot of the people I talked to said we saw Donald Trump's boss we saw the big name Trump on the side of the bus we saw Lara Trump passing out water bottles to us and that was really memorable and we didn't see Hillary Clinton\nDonald Trump also it's kind of talking to the points that really resonated with Robin ... such as I'm going to get rid of NAFTA a lot of people say took a ton of the menu factoring jobs out of the county um I'm not sure\nHow much they think that he's held up their promises but at the time he seems to be speaking right to them\nAnd where does lumber to go from here obviously there are mid term elections coming up in a couple of weeks in there there's probably still a lot more recovery to be done where do they go from here\n[noise] yeah so that's something I was trying to piece together when I was there because you still have hundreds of people in shelters I'm and maybe voting is the last thing on their minds are they weren't really politically engaged to begin with that's one of the reasons we chose brought us in county they have a very low turnout rate\nYou're trying to rebuild you may not be living in your house you maybe with a family member\nSo board of elections are saying well we can send you an absentee ballot you can vote from anywhere\nWe're sending them to shelters we extended the voter registration date by three days but people are that I talked to were saying well I don't know if these measures are enough so it'll be interesting to see who does come out for this election if they're if they're angry enough with\nBeing hit twice in two years and don't feel like they've been paid attention to is that if that will matter or if again they're just going to be struggling to stay afloat\nAshley bolsters act as a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity Ashley thanks for being

Ninety\nOh\n[noise]\nThat is the takeaway from WNYC NPR I public radio international in collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston\nToday is the voter registration deadline for one third of the states across the country from Arizona to Georgia to Illinois and beyond if you want to vote this November this is your reminder to please go register and leading up to election day we've heard a lot about election meddling whether by Russia China some guy in a basement or otherwise but\nWhat's not been in the media spotlight is ensuring fair access to the polls for everyone in the United states who wants to cast a ballot\nHurdles for voters are now getting thrown up across the country\nJust this year the American civil liberties union filed a federal lawsuit against Arizona saying to stay put more than five hundred thousand voters\nAt risk of being disenfranchised and in June a federal judge struck down a Kansas law that required proof of citizenship to register to vote it was deemed a violation of the national voter registration act\nJessica who's minutes here to tell us more she's a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for election land a coalition of news rooms covering problems with voting and twenty Eighteen Jessica thanks for joining us thanks for having me I appreciate that help us understand what's happening here we know that since twenty sixteen there'd been a couple of changes as we mentioned at the\nTop who are affecting really voter disenfranchisement who can and can't vote in this country why some of those changes that so there\nAre a lot of states that have an issue that new voter ID laws or are there are states that have redrawn they're voting boundaries and to make it more difficult for your voice to be heard on in terms of gerrymandering and making\nDistricts far more partisan than they once were and this is sort of been a slow progression states have also a become a little bit more\nBold in terms of um cleaning the voter rolls and sometimes that\nIs sometimes that crosses the line into purging um and and so there are there have been a lot of action so especially in the last two years to make these things happened so there's going to be in this election it's going to get the first time that a lot of these laws are in place and aren't expecting at least a little bit of confusion at the polls\nLet's talk about that because um we talked a little bit about you know cleaning and purging what's the difference there between cleaning the voter rolls and purging the voter rolls I think there are lots of civil rights activists who say this is really an effort to purge and keep communities of color and other folks off of the voter rolls what are you saying\nYou know I think that it really depends on who you ask I think I'm there I think there's no election administrator red and yellow purple a grade that would tell you that\nThat vote or on maintenance is bad I think we all have an interest in making sure that people who are no longer living in our communities or who are no longer eligible to vote for whatever reason remain on the voter roll\n'em but there are states that do this and in a in a particularly aggressive way that might make it more likely that a person who\n[noise] and said\nDoesn't check their email very frequently or wouldn't know to respond to a specific male or or doesn't vote regularly\nWould be more likely to be purged from the voter roll 'em so for example the Houston case which the Supreme Court decided just recently\nAllowed the state of Ohio to remove people from the role if they didn't respond to a few mailers and also didn't vote and and I think two elections and so if you think about the people who are least likely to respond to a postcard\nThat looks very much like junk mail or for being honest\nAnd then also not regularly turn out to vote 'em those might be people who\nAre minorities or the poor or the elderly who are least likely to vote anyway and so they might be at higher risk for getting pers from the rolls that it really depends on who you ask how severe they believe that problem as if you talk to someone like the Brennan Center they're going to tell you that it's a crisis have you talked to someone like the public interest legal foundation they're going to tell you it's a good\nPractice but I Want to push back a little bit there because when I get a notice for jury duty and clear what that notice is I don't think anybody Mrs noticed is that why aren't these notices clear or are they seem somewhat deceptive if you're taking people off the rules and not making it clear that you've done that I mean doesn't isn't that somewhat anti democratic\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a

very likely to ignore them even if they get them a couple of times like I'm not sure that I Would take a look at a postcard and realize that the cat that consequences for not responding to it is that I might be removed from the voter rolls around\nThat the language was huge big bold letters than it is when you get a jury summons and it clearly says if you don't show up you're gay rested\nI Want to turn around for a second here because what happens if they did to twenty sixteen election there were and I covered this there were lots of threats at the polls I'm worried that the fear of people being threatened when they showed up at the polls um peoples claiming to sort of\nWant to implement these checks and balances when they got there are you seeing that for the midterms is there are there that that many levels of concern in terms of who can and can't vote you mentioned confusion at the polls wasn't that going to look like so I think that's what we're more\nLikely to see and this was the case as well and she's sixteen\nAnd we anticipate it ahead of the two thousand sixteen election um a lot of voter intimidation that was on the news every day there were people actually actively making threats about intimidating voters at the polling are costing them there\nThat didn't actually happen um in two thousand sixteen we only saw that a couple of very isolated locations and not for very long and it didn't appear to be any sort of an organized effort and so\nEven if we start hearing sort of threat the head of the mid term elections I think that people should be really wary of the idea that someone's going to scream at them in front of their polling location that is actually not a threat that we have seen and but the talk of that threat\nIn any exaggerating its likelihood would prevent some people from turning out to the polls so I really want to stress\nThat we did not see that on twenty sixteen and we don't necessarily expect to see that I'm twenty eight teach what we did see twenty sixteen and what we do anticipate thing and twenty six twenty Eighteen is confusion around new laws so for example and twenty six team to Texas voter id law was implemented\nUm and it wasn't even necessarily that the law itself disenfranchised people but because there were so confusion about what the law actually say\nBack as I get when you said they didn't actually disenfranchised people the voter id there isn't a voter id require you to have an ID and a lot of people don't have\nThe right it does but in Jackson twenty sixteen there was a reasonable impediment declaration even fill out and that was not appropriately implemented across the state and so that and the the ... information in terms of what voters expected and what poll workers are trained to do disenfranchised quite a lot of people and so we expect to see the same sort of confusion and twenty eight feet around new laws\nJessica who's been as a reporter with ProPublica and the

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies if one side or another ten million and all in this first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set of model that we're starting to see a future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it\nThe first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nWhose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message from residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities were not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cars and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel has done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from uh Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlisted in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can lift and\nTaylor Swift army of swift ... you can lift and the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cars may not be the same\nBut the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one poll from the world it crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what other tricks that used in bees but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and ... and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise for a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion to drive it to your own ends\nThe same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a ... World Cup and jumped into it do the same way that Trump's online army which trying hijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave

broken he writes about conflict in social media was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou are interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nIt was in a certain way you had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military were using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd it wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd source hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who's sat next to ... to a unpack this strange story of two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation\nThe spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia and specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath you even saw attempt to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stop Bush and learn about history we ... so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to what could be a very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term hum and is a high school yearbook the actual term and during his hearing he says no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward it's going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort\nIncluding in winning [noise] you're right that the social media platforms\nAre private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence or using machines to not just them back but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking\nAnd so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on a war\nA certain way to challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fake\nThese are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so with\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations sit served central Florida family more information including locations that are lean do health dot com slash kids networks\nAnd so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome the origin of social networks are lined were a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction white outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so these neural networks ... so I could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane of combat it's something\nTo get real world example of this there have already been creations of speeches that a block Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expression but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich oh by the way you can get off of Facebook you\nCan take out and build it together to allow you to a an essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and sort of just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's going to be monetize for for profit and it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
