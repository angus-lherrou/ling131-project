[noise]\nSo we want to take some time today to do some fact checking on this caravan of migrants coming from Central America but if\nGoing to the middle of the guys make\nYour cameras at certain give it a five minutes or you're going to buy Middle Eastern\nYou're going to find everything I guess what we're not allowing them to get our guys want to say [noise]\nHere to help us unpack all of this is Ron next and the New York times correspondent covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us hey thanks for having me\nSo lots of stuff to take into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about or they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but\nClearly this was a dog whistle I'm thinking who was in the care of Enron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily I agree with him speaking to a an asylum primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there's some people from Guatemala and maybe a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise] but uh and looks largely like it's it's a group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard I'm Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who were it seemed that there are about ten terrorists or suspected terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around this caravan let's take a listen to a vice president Pence\nWell it's inconceivable that there are not um people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people\nAdvancing toward our border\n... well let me let me is to six on this I mean in in the last fiscal year\nAh we apprehended more than more than ten\nTerrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border or from countries are referred to in the ... other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east\nI Lived in Mexico include everybody you know from Mexico\nSo it's not a direct one miner okay\nNo I'm not including people from the northern triangle and and that's primarily who's been referred to as other than in Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people seeking to come across the border either get asylum or crossing the border illegally were or people from Mexico\nAnd non what about those stats the vice president is citing about terrorists being apprehended at the border\nThat's outside the vice president mentions come from um customs and border protection the parent agency of border patrol and it basically says that the agency prevents ten donors suspected terrorists from traveling to or entering the United states every day\nAnd fiscal two thousand Seventeen\nIt makes no mention of them being apprehended at the border uh and it doesn't say specifically that they're coming to the southwest border that typically has meant that these people are being stopped from coming with the airports so yeah it it's called fleeting as that\nThat is meant to be one thing with the whole care of and it and it has nothing to do as far as I can tell with this caravan of people\nHe's also made some claims about him is Thirteen and I don't want to minimize the concern about him is Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen still far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that suggested MS Thirteen or ... is a part of a group in the president's comments about ticket camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see him as Thirteen I I don't know what your master team would look like I mean they're certainly\nYou know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who's ... him as Thirteen looks like that so [noise] you know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground here and in my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles out when it comes to race in politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here around do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm elections\nI think immigration I'm you know obviously it it helped him president getting elected and this has been one of which is not the signature issue for this administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... place while a particularly now UC cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to see they're they're they are they're these people who are trying to get into our country\nUm so I think for them you know it's it's an issue or that they feel they can gain some traction with as you know political scientists and posters are predicting a blue wave particularly in in terms of taking the house of representatives\nYou we've also heard John my pen said that it is or the ... the Venezuelan plot um the president has suggested that the caravan as being supported by Democrats or George Soros his name has been tossed about can we confirm any of those claims\nThere is no evidence that the Democrats are George sorrows or Venezuela have sponsors of this particular care man and and I remember this is something that happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people coming to the U.S and most of them\nActually didn't make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's gonna happen\nWith this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away\nRight which is more than Miami ...

sponsored by a state assembly member in\nSan jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents on it was his dentist actually showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke traffic accidents at heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to ... changes\n[noise] there's pretty good data that that loss of sleep it throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented fan and puts them at higher risk of all of those things so\nIt's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for ... like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why a prop seven wants to be a white white folks are pushing props up [noise]\nYeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice which clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clock steady or around also when we are using daylight saving time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because I got like health benefit because people are exercising their out eating at restaurants they're playing sport they're walking their dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place\nCan you remind us [noise] yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time auditors in the late Seventeen hundred he was living in France he was the American ambassador Paris that it was his habit just leap\nA to work late late into the evening riding by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon\nAnd one morning he got woken up by this loud sound at six AM and realized oldest son's up I could be I could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles on but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries it was a Germany\nThat was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort adopted daylight saving time to save energy\nAnd it didn't used to save some energy it doesn't say much now it seems um it was then made optional between the wars brought back again in the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters and voted to Institute got the daylight saving time schedule that we have now are in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what\nThe bar for Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act that care

it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold there dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the government um a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe heard those of us in the south or who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator\nBut the of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes on the equator we have\nTwelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light so for instance I in California if there's proposition passed and California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in a in a shorter stays at a year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that what it would rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported it as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles as a Californian and it's pointless measure that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness education pathway for immigration prisoner farm\nTo lift it unless even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take I vote no\nDidn't we've just got a coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact is really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money with the decrease accidents and increased

as former CIA director John Brennan CNN\nCongressional representative Maxine Waters her officers and officers Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz here in Florida to her officers as well and I know that comes from Wasserman Schultz is here tonight\nBecause you're saying it's just yesterday your campaign had issue that statement condemning\nAnother robocall racist robocall targeting your opponent have we reached the point where divisive political rhetoric remembers one political party even call the opposite party evil have crossed the line to push some people over the edge [noise] well it's great\nTo be here I Am Ron descent or some uh Iraq veteran former prosecutor I Am on a mission or to protect Florida's future I was at the congressional baseball practice when a gunman I tried to shoot a my teammates that shoots these ... because he didn't like Republicans and so\nI Know first hand that when we start going down that road or that can be very very deadly so I condemn that I condemn what happened today obviously we need to get the facts\nAre before we jump to conclusions um but I think it is important and we try to unify and so my agenda has been I think something that the vast majority of Floridians can get behind number one I Want to keep our economic momentum going I don't want to raise taxes like\nAndrew wants to do I want to keep it going and build office except sweets had\nAlso want to protect the environment that Floridians enjoy we all want to have clean water we all know\nThat that is the life part of our state and if we don't get that right than Florida's future's in jeopardy I Want to protect education opportunities including more vocational and technical training in our classrooms because those are the jobs of the twenty first century and I also want to protect our communities\nBecause you can have a good economy good environment if you don't have safe communities\nA than a lot of that doesn't matter and with law enforcement announcement measure the leader attack for as few\nDirect the same questions sectors and it's the same question to you should go and that is a divisive political rhetoric pushing some of us over the line and over the\nWorld I I think the answer is absolutely it is a we saw not only around the country but right here in our own state a\nDemocratic elected officials who were targeted um thankfully nobody was hurt in today's a incidences of but which we've really seen a collapsing of our political discourse\nUh my opponent as soon as he won the Republican nomination for governor went on Fox News instead\nTo flow voters here in the state of Florida not to monkey to stay up by electing me uh it was followed up that same week by neo Nazis making calls into the state of Florida to attack my character jungle music in the background and the cause of monkeys are being heard uh\nWe've seen neo Nazis empowered we saw what happened in Charlottesville the moral liquid vacation or that this president has demonstrated my opponent or endorsed by him\nOr has run this race very very close to the Trump handbook where we call each other names are where we run falls advertisements and in this case every single\nOne of his advertisements that mentioned by name has been declared falls by politifact yelling at the time\nIs up in the Senate and allow you thirty seconds well\nAndrew Gillum signed a pledge with a radical group the green team defenders to sign up for a radical manifesto that attacked\nOur police officers that said they have no place injustice that said they should be defined it he signed a manifesto that said the U.S was the biggest bully in the history of the planet and that we should take money out of our military this same group that he stands within stands by\nAttacks the state of Israel for boycott divest in sanctions and they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state so you want to talk about division it doesn't get more does this have been the dream defenders and to this day they certainly Andrew Gillum had him or not this damned\nDuring defender I'm going to give you a chance to play in China and\nI I think it's only appropriate Mr dissent to send the last debate lied Twenty one times Twenty one uh and now today makes the twenty second uh and we just\nStarted this debate [noise] so\nThat I signed it was to reject accepting political contributions\nFrom the private

enforcement to make us a city method experiencing a five year low in our crime rats you're thirty second one that I have to give you know yeah that's what she said why did the pledge\nHe signed the freedom pledge say I support the freedom papers that's the manifesto that's been documented in the press that is a hundred percent true and yet again Andrew who is a career politician has never done anything outside of politics will not rich except responsibility for his conduct\nHe wouldn't accept responsibility for getting a thousand dollar ticket from an undercover FBI agent at last debate we now know that he lied about that\nAt some point you got to demonstrate leadership and accept responsibility for what she had done this sort of satisfaction [noise]\nAnd I'd ask our audience that you would please not applaud because we want to have these two gentlemen get all their time in to discuss these issues and the question now is to you Mr Guillen your opponent says your quote embroiled in

which I understand they took later\nUh and his record matters he voted repeatedly to take away health care he voted repeatedly to allow insurance companies to deny people with pre existing coverage or if you are a cancer patient\nA patient with diabetes sickle cell if you were pregnant woman in the state of Florida Mitt citizen scientists will not allowed for your health care to be taken from you that is a fact he can't run away from it just because he wants to be governor the state of Florida he has to level with the people about what his congressional record I have to\nGive this recession under thirty seconds then we're going to move on\nAnybody with pre existing conditions if that falls through the cracks\nIn Florida will stand by you the bottom line is we have to make it more affordable for people that's what my health care plan on ... dot com you can go check it out we're focusing on affordability like a laser were also focused on protecting people's existing coverage Andrew support the single payer plan\nWhich will force people off Medicare force people off their employer plans dump 'em on a government run single payer plan that is wrong you shouldn't be able to keep the coverage that you've earned whether it's Medicare Medicare Advantage whether it's what you're getting through your insurance through your business say they are going to go along with that or is dead wrong\nGentleman fact you expected that to go the way when it was long but I think you both were and going out to a panel is Anthony man\nMr Gillum you support a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in Florida and you support raising the states are corporate tax rate from five point five to ah about eight percent and you say that that money would generate a billion dollars to increase education funding\nWould move those two moves on job creation possibly close layoffs because of rising payroll costs and keep some companies for moving to Florida and you know maybe even called some businesses to leave the state\nYou know and I mean we've seen this and other places are so number one let's get to the tax uh and the and the revenue flow proposal uh we're talking about my opponent has talked a lot about the fact that I Want to propose an income tax I Am against a state income tax I've never proposed a state income tax a Ninety\nSeven percent of businesses then the state of Florida don't pay any corporate tax rate at all Ninety seven percent and guess what I'm not proposing to change that either I'm Talking about the three percent of the wealthiest corporations in this state three percent\nA they received under the ... tax realignment which was supported by the congressman six point three billion dollars from the federal government tax money our money\nUh all were simply saying is that they can keep five point three billion dollars\nBut we deserve a billion of that to come into the state pay teachers ways they can live on offer access to high quality early learning to our children and third reinvest and apprenticeships woodwork shop mechanical electrical technical all of the degree or a training program that they could use to get a job monetize that job and they go into a\nSecond Mr Guillen horse or the other question on the economy is it already has a question from is the sense\nThat you can't see the economic moments in Florida and United Way study last year shows that just under thirty percent of Florida families can be considered the working poor\nThey worked fulltime but can't make ends meet how are you going to make it to help them get bigger paychecks so they can provide for their families\nWhat Andres proposing these massive tax increases those are some of the very people that will be hurt the most\nI started off making six bucks an hour it was a job that I needed to get through school I did multiple jobs\nUnder injuries plan I Would not have had a job I would've made zero dollars an hour businesses will leave the state people lose jobs and we'll stop people from investing in Florida it would be a historic mistake what I'm going to do because I'm going to welcome more investment in Florida and when I'm elected people will know Florida is going to continue to have a low tax climate we are going to be open for business\nAnd here's one injury is not telling you he has a history of raising taxes property tax increases mayor very stiff increase property tax increase as a commissioner in Tallahassee even though he voted to give themselves tens of thousands of dollars in additional retirement benefit\nAnd now he's proposing a forty percent tax increase which is gonna devastate folks but the J. A. M. I. study nonpartisan said if you add up all of a Andrew spending propose\nFor Ninety planes have come some are land how whatever whenever and wherever Orlando it's dedicated to providing many athletes care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six patients that tastes more information is that he's going to help dot com\nThat but he has a history of raising taxes and he's got proposals yeah you know for our little uh I I feel like it because you talk to most or illness plan before it gets the next question I'll give you thirty seconds to talk about your plan\nAnd get forty five I made the ... I don't want to associate or [noise] you\nKnow fidelity toward the rules of the time in this room and he continues to speak over you but I'll Try and do what I Can't with the moments that I have so uh this is the same Congress men who told us\nThat by passing this huge tax realignment taking money from all of the working people in this country and concentrating it with the top one percent of the wealthiest corporations that that money was going to magically tricky trickle down and working people were going to get a raise and what we learned this week\nThey have drilled a deep holding to the national debt\nAnd working people haven't seen any appreciable rising wages let me make sure about this when working people get a raise they spend it they pay their rent and they pay their mortgage and maybe they set up enough to take a vacation and that shouldn't be a no that shouldn't be too much and the state of Florida in two thousand and eight\nTen that is your time so that gives you to send us or give me the ... if you want it\nOh look Andrew was complaining about the economy we're in a situation now are unemployment rates like three point seven percent where honor roll and now I don't think we've reached our potential I think if we do it right we can expand Florida's economic base we can have strong technology sector strong manufacturing strong finance\nAnd we can get to the point like Texas did where there's a national recession\nFlorida is effectively recession proof he's were attracting so much investment but you got to have a low tax climate we cannot allow Andrew Gillum to take away Florida's character as a low tax state I Need thirty [noise]\nThirty second [noise] ... I've said this is the last thirty ... that's totally ... that's ... appreciate your generosity on time uh\nForty four percent of the people in the state of Florida\nSaid that they cannot make ends meet at the end of the month so Mr ... census has big donors maybe doing just fine\nThey get their yacht sitting their boats but for the rest of the working people in this state they simply want a ways they can live on and having grown up to my mother who was a school bus driver and my father who was a construction worker and watching my parents trade between what's bills they could pay before something got cut off\nIt is enough of giving away to the wealthiest one percent and the rest of the people are struggling\nMove on\nMr Jones questions for you you said we've got to end the for profit education system in reference to charter schools in the state ten percent of the students in Florida a ten charter schools to provide an alternative to traditional public education are you saying he would cut\nAny dollars away from what sons charter schools in the state\nNo I'm not proposing any change to the current status quo but what we are saying is that we're going to put money into our public system where over Ninety percent of our kids are still being educated and it's going to begin by paying teachers are ways that they can live on right now\nAnd the state of Florida teachers make an average salary that is the forty fifth low waste of all fifty states\nAnd if my grandmother she wouldn't just say that's a shame she would say it's a crying shame\nWe deserve to pay our teachers are ways they can live on Miami Dade a just a few miles from here the school board is debating whether or not they're going to have to change the owning for property that's on school grounds to create affordable housing because teachers can't afford to live in the neighborhood that they work I\nWouldn't be here today were not from is Aubrey miss ... Mr Estes those teachers who poured into me created an opportunity for me to push past my limits to become the first of my siblings to graduate from high school graduate from college they deserve a ways that they can live on and when I'm governor we're going to fight for it [noise]\nWas going to go to\nThe audience again I Want to hear everything this gentleman had to say so if he would hold your applause it'd be great but she was saying is we're talking education we're also talking charter schools which I Know are important to you as well where do you stand\nWell Andrew staying in a different too because of the Democratic primary he said charter schools will be done and here's my thing they're public schools they're not district managed schools and so they have the ability to innovate and and be a little more nimble and these are parents who are making the decision\nTo send their kids to the schools in some of them are succeeding I mean you know the renaissance middle school here locally is one of the best performing schools\nOr you look at the performance has been positive\nUm you have minority achievement gap is narrowing and some of these schools so all I Want as a result I think public education is very important I'm a product of Florida public schools but I don't think public education is anonymous with the legacy bureaucracies I think parents teachers and students are the heart of it not the bureaucrats that's who I Want to empower\nAnd I'm On a mission to get ... and technical training back into our schools particularly in the high schools we can partner with local industry and give them a good opportunities for jobs\nSo are your other times thank you very much for for letting me jump in there or I Want to get through circumspect you Mr going\nYeah well let me let me say first off the congressman has accepted tens of thousands of dollars from back to devise actually two hundred thousand dollars\nOf their agenda is simple it is completely to defund the public education system and to stand up the for profit charter schools industry for profit my opposition was to for profit schools\nAre in this state uh this is what we ought to do we ought to unleash the talented teachers to teach and unload a nice in my opinion the unmitigated talent of our students to learn\nVisitors centers has pointed out to those records are available they are not available and he has refused to release them that is the fact six years worth of congressional\nTravel every single member of that has been ... does the Salem nc leave I Would like to eat in LA there's a lot of big big difference I Know Richard\nI'm going to direct this next question to\nA lot of TV in August and the first day of the general election campaign you sort of Edward Jones run for governor quote the last thing we need to do is to monkeys is up when embracing the socialist agenda Fox News quickly just about your word saying quote they do not condone language now you call to this response absurd\nYou've made appearances at for David Horowitz is freedom center events\nAgainst four separate times four speeches amongst Mr Horwitz who's statements\nQuoting here this country's only serious race war is against whites\nI'll ask the question of the current the game and I I'm given for the question is are okay\nHe also said if blacks are oppressed in America why isn't there a black exodus\nNow in two thousand Fifteen in your speech before the freedoms that are set of Mr Horwitz David has done such a great ... great work and I've been into Myra I've been to these conferences in the past and I've been a big admirer of an organization that shoot straight tells the American people the truth in standing up for the rights thing those are his words here's my\nPoint here even made those statements then I guess he had sort of the first statement was made them I supposed to know every single saving here's the deal\nLet me just say that let me just say that ... straight out\nOr you know I live my life whether it's athletics whether it's military whether it's a serving as a prosecutor you know when I was down range in Iraq we work together as a team regardless of race we had the American flag on our armed we wore the same uniform and we fought for the country when I was a\nProsecutor set up for victims of every\nRace tolerance for hate that the only way to do it in our country it's something I Believe in as governor I Will represent all the people everyone will get a fair shake but I Am not going to bow down to the altar of political correctness time going to not let the media smear me\nLike they like to do with so many other people are going to break anything from Andrew Gillum who's endorsed the dream defenders which said Israel is an apartheid bay and what's at your whole life and they are\nI Wish he would have waited for the\nQuestion 'cause I had a question is not what you think of as Mr Guillen we'll give you a chance to respond\nTo let me first say my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\n[noise] Mr\nThis anticipate spoken a hit first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out and just say\nA he has spoken at racist conferences accepted a contribution and would not return it from someone who referred to the former president of the United states as a Muslim in I. G. G. E. R.\nOr when asked to return that money he said no he's using that money to not fun negative ad now I'm not calling miss the descent as a racist I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nIf I Would ask the audience to please let us or to senators and our response\nConference I attended was keynote at by a medal of honor recipient named ... ... it was not a racial conference that as a absolute why and I'm not going to sit here and take this nonsense\nFrom a guy like Andrew Gillum who always plays the victim who's going out and and attacking as you aligning himself with through to attack our men and women in law enforcement attack our military he's still will not disavow the gene defenders none of these things people are saying that I endorse he endorsed the dream defenders and they endorsed him and that is wrong\n[noise] [noise] yeah\nYeah happy to to speak on that so first of all he continued to attempt to manipulate my record to me that I'm against a law and order first of all under my leadership as a mayor the happy we hired fifty new law enforcement officers\nWe connected but those law enforcement officers hand in glove with the community to community policing and my city we're experiencing a five year low in our crime rate he described in the last debate a city run a mutt and the little fact had to correct him on that as well I Would miss the dissenters shows as he simply has no relationship with the truth\nOr he didn't have it here as a candidate and he certainly wouldn't have it as a governor but we won't have to worry about that because we retire him on November sixth in keeping [noise]\nI'd like\nTo move on if we could already\nI'll give you a thirty I'll give you a thirty and then well now let's gentlemen I don't want to make this issue for the rest of the debate of who's doing about Tallahassee called the facts matter last year Tallahassee under the Gilman administration at the highest number of murders in the history of the city the guy running to succeed him as mayor right now with the injuries former chief of staff\nHe's sending out flyers saying last year we had the most murders in history we need change we need leadership yeah because Andrew failed on that Tallahassee is one of the most prime written city in Florida bar none of them are the facts\nI Would suggest to the congressman might want to reconsider whether he wants to be governor the governors' mansions in Tallahassee I Would hate for you to be hurt\nBy it is [noise]\nBecause if if it were you were to leave your vision of the city which is completely inaccurate the city of murder in Tallahassee is on a pace to be at a twenty year low and our crime rate and we did that by at the same time arresting fewer people\nOr the city of Tallahassee worked hand in glove with law enforcement and that's why we are ranked in all American city this week we're just rang a number one place to raise a family and that's the kind\nOf city we live and move on now\nNext question is from Anthony man from the sun ... Mr central Florida man's villains who have completed their sentences from voting what's your position on the proposed constitutional amendment that would automatically restore voting rights to films have completed their sentences except for convicted murderers and sex offenders\nThink it's wrong to automatically restore rights to felons who've committed very serious crimes now\nI think ... I Want people to be redeemed I Want people to be able to show but you've got to prove that you're getting back\nWith the law you got to prove many felons re offense and I think it's wrong to automatically give them a of a free pass to be able to vote without them showing that they can be back\nIn our community also think it's very important just as a former prosecutor you know we've dealt with law enforcement I'm committed to having safe communities fact matter the injuries making jokes about Tallahassee when they had the highest number of murders in their history last year I don't think it's\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of made the point that it's W.

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nHad their lives turned upside down by some very very bad people and I think we need to protect our communities I don't want to go down the road where crime is spiraling out of control and so I Want people to be able to earn their way back but you got to earn it you don't get it for free and and\nEvery American Life is of course of action\nWas to be on your position on the\nProposed constitutional amendment absolutely if it doesn't pass would you continue the Scott Arab policy or would you go back to the policy of undercover\nYeah so the missile defenses has never had the responsibility of the obligation of leading a community through a crime or helping to fix a crime problem so he wouldn't recognize that the number one way to reduce crime in a community is to reduce the level of recidivism\nOne of the things we can do to help with the recidivism rate is for these one point seven million individuals who don't have the right to vote a constitutional amendment doesn't give it back to everybody\nBut if you have done your time and you've paid your debt to society you ought to be able to re enter society how your constitutional right to vote\nAnd your rights a word here and the safe because if they\nDon't have the opportunity to make a living for themselves and they all them time fending let's go next\nTime I get very much I Want to go to ... in Florida Today now\nMr Gillum during a CNN debate on Sunday you vowed quote to hold these folks who are the biggest to leaders accountable powerful sugar interest industry has often lobbied against environmental proposes in Tallahassee\nYou're a longtime friend an advisor Sean statement lobbies on behalf of Florida ... one of the largest sugar companies in the state among other interest you have also said he won't demonize the workers who rely on the sugar industry how can load is trust that you will hold its powerful industry accountable\nWell they can began by looking at my record on the environment and energy and the fact that I'd been endorsed by nearly every major environmental organization out there the same week that Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris accord and my city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce\nUnder the Rick Scott administration we hit taking away the word protection out of the ... a department of environmental protection miss the dissenters and Mr Rick Scott\nA negate whether or not global warming and climate change is actually a real thing\nAs it were slow to voters what first date to know about me is when I when this race for governor don't have a governor who believes in science\nAnd we will hold all of the major polluters in this take to include the sugar to include a big ag but also to include the out of control development that it's happening north of Lake Okeechobee so that we can get some real standards back into the state and cleaned up this blue green algae that's flowing out of the east and the west side of the state of Florida how\nWill make that commitment because that is consistent with my value set", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Orlando", "day": "24"}
