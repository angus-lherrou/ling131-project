sources that in fact President Obama was it was a two thousand ten say the union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into

that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really\nLiked that I cried myself up over was when he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong moon and ... and

that I you know I was doing this in\nA ... boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now that the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it [laughter]\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post amongst around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public offering the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there's another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama already or do you wanna do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a

experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents of the minority students objected caffeine is director of the little red schoolhouse and tell us first what was your thinking and trying this\nOr we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is the challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement\n... well you said that are part of this was based on you know research this was an attempt to isolate the minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and if for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school um that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identity oh what's that research\nThere there's research on this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity\nAnd that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing that\nBeing part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nAnd that's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students to have to choose between going to benefit of the group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American student who's one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nNo research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experience isn't that affects the minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's as much a you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those and even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nAnd this is an unheard of than twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school\nHad its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial

particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated hung on that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I I Would say two things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you
