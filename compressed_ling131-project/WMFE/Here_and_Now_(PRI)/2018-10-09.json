Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAbout how similar phenomenon like ah\nOur generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would inserting themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have um and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of\nPublicly mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that\nFurther well but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um Simon and therapy has been to write a letter to himself beer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day\nAnd what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters take it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to enhance into your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for enhancing kind of get caught in this said that spiraled out of control and also kind of changes him Steven Livingston\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also that the people around him are shields by the story as well I um he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear having to mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because he can't get him a lot of things that they can\n\nThat's how you were able to do sealing the news on what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nYou know it's true that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become sort of temple momentum the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nYeah it is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow any a sleep on this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hand\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of sort of hands still sort of hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being forty [laughter] they're becoming more sweaty and then through the rabbit hole before where I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you add the I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know on the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact but we all wanted to know more about Connor\nThe guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of errors in a in a mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I sing I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experience joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't want to give anything away but I have to say we actually find out his back story and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us but it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know using the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feel like a cautionary tale for our times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know

patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits if you've been confidences but continue to this day\nCan tell us is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we would you go that people take care of their team to take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a civilian section I'm a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult and desperate\nSo you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't right\nThat's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nDo you think this is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there it's a great point\nOur hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift to the to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\n[noise] one of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece a pretty homogenous white community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrants storage so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate but the show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHave grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange or populations in the Nineteen twenties [noise]\nIn the fall of ... they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone
