people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons and everybody shooting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model ...\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against them and for you said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but getting what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong a potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the seriousness of the crime the nature of any\nHarm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors\nThat we think reasonable people would think would be important but\nSome law enforcement officials say the current system is making for the less safe Leon county sheriff waltz McNeil agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nWage do other things like a you know the sexual batters who are those keeping them away from kids the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to tape but just the a fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nWith ... them from any of the crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only served to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turned to a life of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personal ... went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted an office to certain things but I never got involved because I said what can make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen it count made me feel like we're not a citizen ...\nSawyer recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure how to use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me this kind of like or a book of this part of a book list I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do uh I just make for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in the case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here and now I'm Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in\nA decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends\nBut the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibilities to lead the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course a hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher\nLet's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her highland\nNephew in person um explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of tightening the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is an office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into that\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Barack Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with him he of course I wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis\nPicky Clinton's 'em all part of a ... a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for the decisions and so forth record how important it says\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like I'm ... on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature as wanted to do in the past that they kind of it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around\nSo a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders and this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because\nCommunities but his face criticism from the police union and the White House you're listening to run down [noise] ooh\nI'm Joshua Johnson the host of one day become a sustaining member of W.

general contractors of America showed that eight out of ten building firms in the U.S can't find labor and in Florida it's even worse and that was before hurricane Michael flattened entire town [noise] this week\nWe hadn't talked to a building sites meet up with members of the Tallahassee builders association men averages executive officer Doug Barton is the current president my Catholic the incoming president we started with guns\nSo when it comes to work is just give me that some of the problem that you're seeing and getting workers here\nIn two thousand seven recession we lost fifty percent of our industry and they have not return and found other work so as things if the backup we're still working with half our workforce\nA lot of people left the industry and then I'm Mark you're left with people who might have aged out of the industry retired\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact our average aged framing contractor is fifty seven years old\nSo can you give me the kinds of jobs you are missing right now\nEvery trade who's who are missing from drywall are still plumbers to office staff in the construction industry if you talk to any company they are looking for help and they can't find it\nEnded up let's say some of the side effects what happens as a result of not having enough workers\nFor my general contractors prospect of the homes that used to take a three to four months to build now they're taking six to eight months\nAnd I'm sure that you have to be higher than\nThey do they have to we have to recover that calls but you still you don't cover the full cost materials have gone up the last three years probably thirty percent\nAre you worried about materials clean up even more about the tech tariffs\nAnd hurricanes absolutely Leno send us email as several times a day of those looking from Mary in Panama City to all these places needing their homes to be rebuilt or repaired and you know I'm thinking to myself week we struggled day to day\nTo keep up with what we have had prior to this storm we I mean physically I mean there's a new housing knew how to just struggling with balancing act bouncing how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo in order to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who have been hurt by Michael\nThe lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of a equipment a lack of rivers and a lot of unlicensed activity\nWhat else do workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe raise salaries mark maybe increased and if it's\nIf there's not enough ... town or not enough electricians in town to do the amount of work than when they did the jobs they raise their prices because they know there is no one else to come in to take the work or if\nMark has his painter coming and I know he's coming to Mars job and I look at him and I said listen here you know how about a few extra hundred bucks to come by first Patti marking the baggage you're saying that actually small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nThat the training is one thing that you're talking about stealing you're competing we ought to be you talked about what happened because of recession a huge blow but then you have this you know slow steady blow\nThat has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're nodding markets are impacting the building and see\nThey are if you look at a lot of the trades they are immigrants I Believe the hurricane Michael the damage done over there if we did not have workers from other countries that were just would knock it down to what\nWe're doing through education and bringing a younger kids and introducing them in the construction for decades we've taught them it's got to be college just got to because you've got to be college and you know there's a vast majority of the aid don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them\nAnd we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract is in the way over here\nAnd and these guys are making up twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and that's climbing\nSo at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and for many people the college just the right thing like you need welders and you said\nFor Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando how to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nA high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school and they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field of making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this that but not to lead immigration just yet\nIf you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are ... on the job before anybody else they're working hard to stay until sun down so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\n... I I you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's\nA lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and\nOne thing I notice in common of all of them is primarily a Hispanic workers this area\nNeeds to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because their homes are gone their place of business might be gone to shop that he had just gone it's going to take a lot of builders\nFrom a large part of the country that's just the way it is what\nElse would change ...\nWe see a move recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools we spent many years not exposing\nYoung people to that type work and telling them what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college the guys right here standing here doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement of kind of making it more enticing how else to get\nTheir revert back to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisor heroes and you're you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies\nDouble triple that one more thing I think stigma that's what the big talk was the last Thirty years you gotta have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual you know getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big early you got to get over you\nWorry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming the and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have the legal\nNo I don't I think that Doug and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe\nOther states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City and in Mexico beach the structures that survived we're not that much different than what

nine four seven\nAuto it's here and now I'm\nRobyn Young in Florida where one of the hottest races in the country got a little more heated yesterday\nThe Tampa Bay times reporting that attacks shows the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star as of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump David Ron dissent is as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum except it he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida's history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now are the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to healthcare you said you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for anyone running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in this state we were ...\nFor Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nOr just city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nThe missile defenses described out community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he it clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognized that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what is humidity do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices\nCreated reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to re enter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high law list a you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in\nReality I Want to see that President Trump you know in your debate with Ron Santo as you said he was a student for the president you may no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his lieutenants without acts of leadership\nWell an absence of leadership as you as you put it ... times polling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do it\nI'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr disasters he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society and it kind of a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran just answered that if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ... money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with a check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with\nPresident Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle that disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Florida two point eight billion dollars\nI'm going to take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to\nHelp him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott who again don't agree on a lot politically during this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent present it is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to build reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting governors Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to end an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who\nVoted against the clean Water Act thirty three times as the mayor before the capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acres solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda we recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building a more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum narrow Tallahassee democratic are going to try the candidate here in Florida and there again thanks so much for speaking last of course take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from killing his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\n[noise] you ...\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from central Florida community arts presenting our greatest hits here Florida as large a

some exciting races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between the Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for US Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane hits and what we're hearing [noise]\nHere the Democrats\nI'm a Republican some of the road\nCandidates or agree with\nI have to be with us from\nWith me is that\nThat Wendy Alaskans in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel let Jake Bernstein an Alexander Trujillo healthcare President Trump\nCan the sitting governor the Republican mix dot unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson has a lot going on to let's convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and make Acevedo an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami Jaime gay Hi Robyn\nI'm getting closer to you I'm In your state I'm Glad [laughter] and when they hear in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin things from young well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets Hamilton handled and makes it for this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know it's just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and I and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke a story the tax\nIn which a gallons friend a lobbyist told them about this health and take it that this developer had for them Gillum respond awesome but he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs it's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissenters in some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to you and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here or that or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions so I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe ... camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies and the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship what the president to the people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation our water resources what's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump\nI don't know what for ah but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race well\nI mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary\nUm to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's than uh\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and bang bang Sanders was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary there was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping in Theresa's tweeting support for a candidate\nWell and ... as if they don't let me bring you in here because a person it also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugee some say undocumented immigrants making their way to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are going to have like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it\nThe bar for Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nGun Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the caravan same they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged garb and are they very convenient time for the president\nBush said that the issue of immigration front and center which you already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... ... all the garbage and all the attention describing has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nUh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the journal both parties I think that religion is a a turnout election\nWell and not to be clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last cabinet and they got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nUh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not vote in a block\nOr you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida is a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr someone just state in two thousand sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans to many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the pure game are you\nOver for weekends I'd have seems ah coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor's race in ... in the Senate race oh it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand and one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nWill kill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent\nTurnouts in and voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out here so after tell them why because you keep on going on on every part
