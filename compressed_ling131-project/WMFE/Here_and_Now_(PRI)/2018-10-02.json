political editor Domenico Montanaro is here Hi ... hey there you know this has followed a pattern of investigations over the decades it starts out as one claim a claim of a\nSexual attacks series claim and now it seems to be about what judge Kavanaugh said about his drinking in high school and college so many people coming forward to say he didn't tell the truth you can't lie under oath so first what are you hearing um [noise] as these friends come forward is this swaying Republican senators as we're hearing about the drinking\nOr so far and not really a you know at this point Republican senators are sitting back and waiting for the FBI investigation will be concluded and to try to have a vote this Friday or as you noted there with Mitch McConnell saying that there will be a vote this Friday\nAnd that they anticipate that that Brett Kavanaugh will be exonerated through ah through what is a limited FBI investigation\nI'm President Trump initially said the FBI investigation can be a blessing in disguise but that was when the FBI had been instructed it seems to interview just four witnesses three who might have\nBeen in the house when a sexual attack took place and then a second accuser now the FBI has been getting broader latitude do we know who else they're talking to\nWe don't know exactly but the White House can set parameters for the investigation

happening these are the trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used\nTo go after them have been quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government they encourage the Chinese sauna road\nTo self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leverage an influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which has surely the most effective way to influence\nChinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular ones relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize the long run American\nInterests and what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\n[noise] they're all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want tariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs that companies need in order to compete that's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient\nAnd so there's something very odd about administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes\nOn uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas so are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being taxed cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican craven this in front of\nPresident Trump is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBut it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge sponsors and supported\nBy President Trump and President Trump may not have a majority within America with him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able to a\nRally Republican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions\nTo stand by his side you know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about senators who were guarded their\nCore beliefs as being more important to them than their reelection I

recession\nIs likely to take 'em very long time to reverse I'm One who believes that we have a very different to count on me than we used to therefore I think the approach that's being pursued is\nOkay and I would not be one or to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do I\nI have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry in a major bank and and he was saying that the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence that at the end

retirement a couple of who sold their home traveling and staying in other people's homes to save money\nMillennials who work day and night to earn a million dollars and live off investment income well there's now a name for this called fire financial independence retire early and fire is on fire inspired in part by books like your money or your life\nAnd stoked on blogs podcast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent down all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let's got tell it he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nHi thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is\nPete ad me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives you move you started saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on the podcast\nThat was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nIn our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know ...\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as what was so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculated it kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in art eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that's what put her over the edge\nOkay so there's a sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really liked my job and for me it's not about work for me it was about a ring myself from\nThis idea of mandatory labor you know there's passion that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that salt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what you and your wife did just to keep the story going is it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nExtra job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant truth that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading this lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest breeze to fire you weren't part time or like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can\nGet health insurance but the infamous yeah yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough\nThat the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race it's\nOne of the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial advisor your especially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big tips and dives and\nIf you can ride those way that you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as that it and forget it that was really really a nice entry point for me\nWell in part of this in order to do this as a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to his Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you we're absolutely miserable and we go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing\n[laughter] yeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was because we are on the road for a year we we actually we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff a while we were living in the air and space and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it's just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire with like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [noise] I mean have you

Smith who a Ford says was there a it includes drinking is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which\nAh he and his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which an incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin a yearbook has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin as your book entry\nView I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when a your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back do you have the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and want to talk about flatulence or age sixteen hundred year what page\nOn 'em game for the ... that's not what this means\nWell it's sort of unclear what boost means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking there was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right a reference to him drinking a lot and and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear the drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse the anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term and is your book devil's triangle here is\nDevil's triangle\n\nAnd how's it played\nSupport for Ninety planes and the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nWhat about that one again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are just devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engine to try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of a suggestion is about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search a books that they have indexed I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either boo for devil's triangle the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically um but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says that a devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had made\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabin on his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before on part of what happens\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you\nCan you answer that question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking nor do I okay thank you so Chad\n... who's a former classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin I had not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it possible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nOff I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're often times in which he appeared to being a past hated [noise]\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or some people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point\nIf it was the case that he with some regularity and high school uh gotten drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence\nThe story that he says which is that he doesn't he never did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what we're doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happened well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend or talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes I Would think", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "02"}
