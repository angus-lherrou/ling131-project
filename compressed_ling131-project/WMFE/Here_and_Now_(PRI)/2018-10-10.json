I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities mentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states off so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nSo great and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he\nGets his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own niche of\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they saw was law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assume they were bad\nI recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida [laughter] run into the building to help save people during that shooting and after I found out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Dru Joyce thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nOne of those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured\nThat they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have

Scott\nHey Jeremy and with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for K. PCC Hi merry air so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate\nThis week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue\nOf cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of the state being affordable and livable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento or the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people uh Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls this Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party and California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox and when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some\nConservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough place California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm going to end brand has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and using indicated he'd take a similar approach especially on issues like immigration healthcare environmental issues and used them support sanctuary cities for example he backs California becoming a zero carbon emissions said\nAnd but there are couple areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has\nAnd one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown using his indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running south\nWhen as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump or the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nOr the other is on a terrible job running the state of California and you know property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property taxes are way way out of whack\nPeople are starting to move pretty soon and if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are boring grew in California can do it [noise]\n[noise] she's got a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters are prepared to go to the polls next month\nIn like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nAre their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independents\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations that are lean do health dot com slash kids are the\nIssues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI forwarded melody homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races and you know there are just as she ended up affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat\nBecause in California the top two vote getters face each other and the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh hearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some have said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott issued vulnerable\nUh maybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead in every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think\nKevin do we don't just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media are paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist and her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this cabinet fingers playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know I haven't seen Broadway but\nOne thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old he's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us\nAbout the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington better ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is for scientists especially for younger voters here in California\nAnd daily an argument there certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we re bind or rewind back there twenty sixteen", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "10"}
