the critics here with describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ... yeah thank you it feels like\nWe're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take him on there and just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company of easy for the first time ... and yeah I mean I I've never done a play before but I have an argument at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating at a certain moment some of gyms ... like make the audience go oh this guy thing ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous to told I find like five you up to go okay I have to act to try and win this even more\nAbout do you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys can hear this he kept going yeah well I did when when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players\nTo be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim ... who we've been seeing a lot of 'cause they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I heard people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty ritually thirty of his relatives who've flown in from [laughter]\nCountry and and I when I opened the books at which they came they gave us for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use you use your\nCharacter as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's the she's the soul was the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and damage damage every night as I come down to the moment is a play where decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me\nOther so often you if you publish Eleanor every night now that are going to be talking about post ... money [laughter] I worked for equal wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I just got to talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are three one step closer to thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or news\nFor between a say in a piece of writing in the newspaper\nThere is no different to be the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play or yeah\nOr the difference in an artistic peace being written and you know what would you say about the Greek history what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four because you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously does that you care just not a bad guy we're in real life\nAnyway he's just he's a writer as an artist\nBut in your life she she has said that the real writer who said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn do some ...\nPeople just destroyed her and they continue to do so um\nI don't think it's fair joined does it work for the Washington Post he was not writing articles for writing articles for New York times you use the looming eating in the lives of people who normally would never be written about that follows in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say to all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line in most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nAnd there's a whole world of facts to choose from the wrong stocks get in a way of the story\nAnd your cats are says the wrong times what does that mean exactly\nWhat you got to be aware that we have a presidential health person Kellyanne Conway you spoke of alternative facts ...\nSinger can because there's a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and it frequently get supplies\nThe argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue and the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debate about the length of time this person fell for mass one of those moments of the audience is China going oh come on clearly you are going to follow that you know the difference of math as you know Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it true or you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain play what Jim single start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case about picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and joined gets more intense you'd\nDo both the calm the divided United States in a way you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are\nIn the middle talk about this is Kelly on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance\nStrangling each yes yes you know winning that fight [laughter] I saw the U.S strongly dinner yeah\nIt does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I

learn more posters Smith dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis this year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country seems story is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are and I do not just because one state the brass guy does not have both the house and Senate they only have one\nChamber but the Democrats only control thirty two wire\nRepublican so dominant at the state level\nWent over well with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've earned candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong election\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight and in terms of chambers of legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and a and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and and a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator lines that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty census is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's right you hear me that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled\nAnd less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates\nWho will be directly involved in redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policy making in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one\nBut I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans on for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of us\nFor Ninety point at a news comes some land out how to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six out patient ... more information is that she's darling do house dot com\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is ... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures of twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house and it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the\nDemocrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... and state legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\n[noise] uh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for or did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year\nAnd despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislator who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important\nNot just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties and one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special election and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protected on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend the money how they do\nWhat's called collateral damage that's next time around here and there are rules\n\nThe point seven it's two o'clock [noise]\nI'm going to talk for ... coming up with an excellent point to immigration in the mid

might be grouped\nAnd everything really adding a somewhat of an access or natural connection game is offers the example of amendment ... which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work but if you look at it from a snake I environmentally friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together\nI Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that it just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue just make this shorter and easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment needs to be clearly understood by voters Timothy ... is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat he needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible I saw the more you and fold ... different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot\nThree other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they are voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party and they had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters the where\nFor here and now I'm Danny Rivera in Miami whether you're a voter in\nFlorida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PBS Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number of measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgent specifically in citizen initiated measures measures that get on the ballot through a signature petition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there are a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\n[noise] yeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year I other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id of campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot in\nThe process varies by state the number of senators required as usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand in a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group at our national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to do something about\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process it was a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exception to prove that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons for the most part the citizen initiative process of used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decided to doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent sort of using more initiatives you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nKilling

I mean what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap to try to get reporters to talk about them none of that it's clear\nHowever we do know the special counsel's office has has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there there's some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place in ...\nIn other words if somebody was masking masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about mother and she was just the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nWell know email earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan of Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand ... didn't have to have an immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lived there are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believe they'd have to leave the United states he\n... is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan if they recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago\nWas prepared to lose her temporary protected status on November second which had been the deadline she joined us in Studio welcome thank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U.S under this temporary\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nWould be a good deal of your life yes that's a big chunk of my life and you haven't returned to sit in during that time no fat so I Know you can't talk about why you came here because you have an asylum case that is correct what kind of life had you created here in the United states and\nThe United states has been very kind to me I was able to let my kitchen I have a master's degree from ... from Brandeis University\nI worked with the department of public health as a healthy debate and for Eighteen years\nAnd right now I work with western governors ... an online to schools that is based in you that right now um and what can we see him as an ... so we provide to ask I didn't make a technique I help on line for just yet\nWilling we should note that since it's a sensitive subject for TPS holders did the government didn't pay for your education you pay for that yourself\nSo having crafted that life you know find yourself in embroiled in an asylum case whether or not you can receive asylum in this country and you were under the threat of deportation what did you think when you heard that your status would be ended\nAnd last time I find\nThat are finding it\nAh it it's um\nI haven't been here for Twenty one years and when you live in a place for as long as it comes home humans alive is gets I don't have kids that I Know so many of the best holders who are raising up gets here a\nCommunity here yet I be me so I think the estimate is close to four hundred thousand people watch TV at home does right now he's the United states from different countries that\nDo I understand you you actually starting to prepare for having perhaps to leave by the end of this week that you shut things down I mean what did you do thinking you might have to leave it that's true because um\n[noise] I used to on that just aren't\nDreams that I wanted for so long and I was it was like you said eating into into Fifteen I bought the restaurant and ah when did this has been ...
