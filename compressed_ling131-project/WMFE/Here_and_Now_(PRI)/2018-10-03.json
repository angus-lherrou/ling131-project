unsolved art heist in history listen and apple pie August\nIt's here and now it was a part about the last year that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers they were having a good time she said\nAt my expense my friend said when he heard that that was let through them back over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state that was three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like lassie Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried at that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lassie Ford and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline report it in the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline cause tripled and ... heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all the the seas rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy Saturday of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago or say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior\nAnd we're continuing to see an increase calling and writing and what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to a doctor for it they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the sometimes and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody had a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment they if they feel their heart pounding or they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's an expected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidentally be killed you know in other words this isn't about sex didn't did people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about you know the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nIs reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well my son intense feeling of fear and we're hearing that as well from the survivors that we work with we usually\nPeople have a flashback she's also explain dust that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor read I didn't sing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative as\nThey are able to define a frequently what the worst part of that experience wives\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to their response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way that trauma is stored in the brain to literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma\nAn incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to and what that was exactly like for her time yes yes yeah\nLook the majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been groped and forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a reveal that she'd been raped by a music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know it was happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe on people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new and then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was [noise]\n\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know\nAnd feel again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhat happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling safety come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just name that there will never be enough detail to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victim remain and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause as Dr Ford said and as so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details
