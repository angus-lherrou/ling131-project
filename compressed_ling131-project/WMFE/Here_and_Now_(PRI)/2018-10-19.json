Eighteen into combat and she's really seen as a Democrats hope to kind of flip one Republican controlled district in the country in their favor\nYou know she prided herself on really tried to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district um but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts\nOf the most evident last week she brought for vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in owing ville it's a town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nNow the thing about Amy McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars it about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and it's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere's certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know it may be nationwide interest in this race I mean if at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more\nTV ads and it really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November\nSix and what do the polls say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there's no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge and and really isn't something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nSo Kentucky ... six congressional district will be one of those key places people are watching to see if Democrats can take a seat from Republicans in flip the house in the Democrats' favor that Dr Lynn Barton statehouse reporter for Kentucky public radio thank you thanks Peter\nThe TV show the Congress premier this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr\nABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was a hit it was cancelled though after it started tweeted racist remarks now the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it hiring\nHiring so the first episode is a send off to the character Roseanne counter we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office a autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just ibuprofen Scott to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grin and more bed what do you think\n[noise] I think she's right but I also think the storytelling worked\nUm they had for shadow that I'm Roseanne counter that character would be struggling with a an addiction and pain pills and so if they're going to kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and also hosted into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talking about because of the way that there was any kind of character past well\nAll important issues the question is who saw the show a and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors we're down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on average you tuned into Roseanne when they returned last march\nRight but um there's a few things going on there and I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting\nAnd then you also had news that the rules and counter character was going to be a Trump supporter\nAnd I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show so I think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of his run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so I don't think the Connors is going to get to that level\nBut it's drying up out in the same audience that Roseanne the revival was doing when it ended its run in may\nAnd then it's going to be their challenge the kind of build an audience\nAnd retain people who may have just watch the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to residents character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the ... than they did in Roseanne\nI seen two episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show they've tried to talk about all of the different issues that face the working class family and it wasn't quite as part is that I mean\nExports to the U.S we're up Thirteen percent last month you're listening here in Los ...\nI'm Matthew ... points even used where

Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a fight regulator in charge in Washington\nSo both you know the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left in the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either a they won and more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators and the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all of these new products enough to oversee\nWell that's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have\nWe don't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that the risks that that agency overseas are adequately taken care of I think the same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are\nExtremely complex and yes they are\nAlgorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people on the political realm\nBut they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency as appropriately structured appropriately funded and appropriately stashed so they can understand what's happening on Wall street even if they can't\nDo do you get a better understanding and writing this book of why crashes happened how something that seems small can get out of control very quickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes although it wasn't a big surprise yeah we've been laboring for decades to the um the notion of inefficient and market a rational market where investors make rational decisions and and those decisions are incorporated into the prices of securities automatically", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "19"}
