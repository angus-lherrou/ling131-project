little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved\nTo make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you how simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved keep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah I used to walk\nA walk the ideal shape\nFor holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high side\nYou want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a it's a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their owner and the hot oil right so I have my walk I also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nHad about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there\nI can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or I don't know it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting to keep it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you can have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some butter fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken and American satellite can listen to that crunch alright\nBecause but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and butter milk tender ISIS chicken it at some of that is ... flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I got to do well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little suspects you see I used a very course\nOf course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and here's another track\nOkay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the best pieces\nBecause each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time\nAnd if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there you're not going over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of honey hearing some lemon so you would yeah I don't like it out a lot I like the way the lemon touch the fatty notice of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey\nAnd a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken for ... oh yeah and what's right with the honey isn't the honey that Israel limbs out their sweet flavor there\nBy the subtle yeah kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left of oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answered the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown\nBut the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is\nMy version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinate it the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw ginger little catch up to Seventy and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nFood so you fry it you cool it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispness\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and\n[noise]\nIs your car boat motorcycle or RV facing yet another repair and maybe it's time to donate it to the ... the

all this out Carly welcome\nYeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year\nDo you have any idea why [noise]\nYeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are working family and you're working minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened\nUm there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and once that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country or you've seen a an issue where people are getting priced out of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community as what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happens before things start to crumble underneath\nThem and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes or no for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognized\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to

different\n[noise] it's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm

we need so we require solely on our own community to provide 'em funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have systems set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them closing that they need some times we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs opt to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every

work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study was his kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you will know then

how to use the body's immune system to attack cancer\nAllison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform at the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr ... welcome and congrats to you and your colleague on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for a gym for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack\nCancer well Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis main insight was to understand how to block of protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in Athens enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Alison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what is that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery\nChemotherapy and radiation and creating an entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree man and allow us to reduce the side effects associated with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nWhat kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular results including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nUh genes Allison started his career at NBA Anderson in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the empty Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy\nAnd the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the
