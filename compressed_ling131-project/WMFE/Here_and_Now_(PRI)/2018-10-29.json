M. S. it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising called the silent drive and this is how we do it now that you've been happy family\nDon't your support for uninterrupted programming but donating a dollar a day the W. M. F. U. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nA small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York where it may not be as widely used correct\nYeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also school history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose\nOur piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website\nAnd look and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools civil link people out here now down to earth but right now the example like you say you decided to implement this in grade school what might a specific part as a curriculum ... and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings talking about sadness and happiness and\nJust general kind of sense of ... a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially to very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when ... comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd if he's asked me what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they're better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness county\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment this night also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education\nAnd if you notice opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects with kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response that look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology went on one we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talking about stigma\nTalked about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that\nAs more and more these discussions going on and people are realizing gee educators families that you know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's going to let him and he's the c._e._o. of a nonprofit mental health association of New York state one of the groups that advocated for the new law that it's just gone into effect requiring all public schools have some form of mental health education

I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asked me at a party or near the woman who is in love with the dog\nWith a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know we do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I\nThe bar for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nSite yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic early they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it is it\nTrue that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen\nAnd to the child is having being difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throats because of something powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person to a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that uh her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nYeah dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I remind you of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice for low who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book is called the friend from secret newness and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tap for those who want to wrestle the story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "29"}
