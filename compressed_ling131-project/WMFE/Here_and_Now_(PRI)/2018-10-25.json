how many\nRight when he left that with female they told me there are more than a thousand people in shelters at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm\nAre those people on the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than that you know thousand or is that the phone\nWith somebody with family or friends or in cars uh your colleague Lynn

think about those FEMA trailers that there seems to be a you know at some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course there's local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seeing

Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in\nA local high school and just going to listen to\nWhich they've been charged I mean it was just like all the windows busted out back and [noise] all the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I have an her house was destroyed a brother in law just houses destroyed yellow you know a lot of people have lost their homes\nTo first of all clarify for us because driving around this is driven home or in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach home not\nRight it's just that part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these either even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and said since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way to to begin rebuilding their homes\nWell and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another ... challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some company called one that gives them the ability of lived close we've got air they don't have anything\nAnd so I've got like Robin assistant manager we call him James he lost

comfort\nWhen he says we got there he just he conditioning air condition right how are people getting by if they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about eight Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup processor that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for is a

really healthy marsh is throughout the ... one of the protective factors in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida oyster population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters and indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population and the scientists will tell you guess what you're going to find out you've got healthy fish that healthy crowds you got healthy trend and so when you see this challenge with oysters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with your other parts of your system you're the river\nKeeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river\nAnd really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nSo you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river may mean to them and you will get you will get many stories of why people love this place that are fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers [noise] we've retreated to the river keepers office a vote you had to be called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Coleman director of Florida state's coasts and remind\nHer colleague Dr Sondra brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection joined I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on reverse that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all its nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and not coming down anymore so that's really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr book because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish gross\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with salt water is that encourages these marine credited such an oyster drills and ...\nFor

on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I think some people wonder why the bailout and just shut down so that it could replenish let's start with the day\nAnd a an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened\nIn the wake of the oil spill was at the fishermen were allowed to go out and harvest all the oysters to fear was that there's still would come in and kill the a ... couple of years later and there was snow birds stock left there to re populated I think about the functions that oyster surface is beyond\nThe economics and clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that race or she can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race are she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things but you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been reaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that\n... is that oil ... shell what they larval oysters settle on but distributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the when what\nWould you recommend any we haven't even mentioned climate change and the drought that has been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up what you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nFair particular types of research that can be done that could\nRelatively quickly in the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the day the fisherman really understand what native but they want their livelihood restored\nSo there is a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest fix posing that that is probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find fisherman not fully support full Dr Bruce\n... research and really a committed effort instead of throwing short term solution what a bank desalination plant I think there are more\nProblems and um ... you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but the only time a comeback\nUsually want a system crashes it's not just one thing that they are also other factors in
