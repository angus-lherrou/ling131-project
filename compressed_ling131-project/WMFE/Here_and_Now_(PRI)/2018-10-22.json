this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region and surely\nIran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen and Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia is in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how\nA condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old crown prince\nA has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nAh to have a a ... you know some kind of a adult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be in Saudi

Bob Menendez and it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our senator record this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race is a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joan\nHi Jeremy so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in a mistrial\nLast year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign and then he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say she has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting\nWith the Jersey of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nWas your despite all of that are there been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party that Senate majority pac just drop several million into the race to cement Menendez has lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to

kids\n... so what about you can says she was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob huge and he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking the u._s._a. today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about\nWho's judgment was sitting in the Senate fighting\nAbove you raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not wise with three times for drugs that those cancer patients politically need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\nWell it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug rebel and that they've doubled in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\n... has also you know ... uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that were approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump you spend a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he went through the the Republican convention so\nYou know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about him it keeps coming up in my conversations with people but so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know you get tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and\nThey're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nBut a long time since ... New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty pretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and a reelection them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank well beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of him and then there's the support and the party\nAnd just to you know popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of W H where I was talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it will know now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves at police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing\nDNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with a federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... why rock of member station WBUR a member station K.

the ones who were released by Boko Haram been living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a powder the condition of the access we host he's a kid the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it but they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the gals about lost it happened to the gym three is they will help I that's why\nI Am partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative\nBut also we the girls are released in may we started filming with them and not government safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite rules they um with still processing

was down and they were really well what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like well they they um low they was free to speak to his of they did give his diaries discreetly\nIt and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't good that they\nWere forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment [noise] ah and in the film what we do is\nThe uh the girls at the book goes who have taken was actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of girls in Nigeria who was taken by her around who are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one\nGirl in your film who was married had a kid ah with somebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid is I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's of Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the sound is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a soldier or either come slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a cell that the Gulf felt like they you know we're right [noise]\nAnd and we're supposed to be that wide say she you know as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met ... like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my maybe of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... if you'd have been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay about ... children that will say older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill in Iraq [noise] ah people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram it's\nKind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just fled their towns out of fear of vogue\nAround they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah is it functioning I think all the focus is being on Syria and\nYet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these they called an ID Peter ... a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run too because Boko Haram you know they've done just could not they then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to them\nAnd their their outcomes but then a lot of the uh loves internally displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped poker her um but they both have been incredibly welcoming to the numbers distaste people who have come to made it very\nWell let's talk about that the the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military and their constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city\nSo when we would that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks in one night and he just never know\nWho to trust because they'll call her I'm uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it in Tibet sued the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this right it's coming from and where and when I said that's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy to\nMore or less often afterward why do we fought for skin they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can we say live for the Sunday Edition sponsored by Google\nHere now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with the ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brandy content or the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd also trying to reform at some of the advertising in two brand of content which is marketing package as entertainment or new show\nOn it let's take this first changed Fox is calling it the Ninety nine second sixty second breast started these nine sixty second break jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means should traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial ... so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second you this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd then also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy or brands and and basically upstairs you to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for the\nShow the financial model is to charge more for the jazz part so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at\nA they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume do advertisers like the they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air is worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain All right\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much like you\nIs Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries there are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around\nIt allows you to wrench your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSame your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd some get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using their cars we already own source that are buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen in that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority of the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works uh right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you
