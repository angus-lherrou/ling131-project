Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nWith President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Dina phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the ... for example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown sheets of Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and trying to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I'm actually I'm with my wife has an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with low selling meet us in defining the state law marches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest I\nHe said the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and so public safety issue ages I is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally are abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad thing to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nBut he says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied been a few days is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of San than about eighty percent\nLatino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the city is here to serve them\nWell we we spoke earlier with the\nCity manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city of la selling me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor to criminals you say what\nThat he\nIs a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land\nHe oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and I do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal shouldn't be how ... how accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you're only crime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to survive being able to provide for your family\nThat's not something that I see that uh they said he should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is a slap certainly will we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um we responded ... responded criminal behaviors irrespective of your status so when\nRepresentatives from ice state makes their job more difficult what do you say to them\nSo federal authorities hum are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law or we do not\nAnd so we're just like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law in there and and they do that so um the other pieces has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they calling right\nSo um the ideas to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks that call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana there is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what an minister ration Bush Obama and now Trump when there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates at our custody for local crimes not for ice issues\n\nSupport for Ninety points at a news conference in that I associate the Winter Park white actor Garry biker Dr Sandra Barker in Dr Caitlin Kelly has been providing comprehensive and

Democrat\nIn twenty sixteen they changed its primary rules allowing the top two vote getters to advance to the general election regardless of party\nPolls show that state senator Kevin daily own is a long shot to defeat Feinstein who's been in the Senate since Nineteen Ninety two we invited both Feinstein and daily on to join us Feinstein declined Kevin de Leon accepted welcome to hear now thank you very much for the invitation\nSo Senator Feinstein one forty four percent of the vote in the primary versus your twelve she is well known she's well funded\nAnd the polls looked pretty good for her why do you think you can win this race\nActually the latest poll has a has a ... eleven percent there's two polls one at eight percent one at eleven percent and win that election took place on June fifth I'm more she's secured forty four percent of the vote to my twelve percent\nThere were thirty two candidates on the ballot if you open up the ballot um it looked like the white pages there were so many names um and many of the pages I was actually the last name on the ballot for the U.S Senate\nSo our goal was always to given the top two uh so we can juxtapose are accomplishments our our vision and our values for California\nSo the two leaders independent polls now hold us a at eleven points and eight points are respectively so we still have a solid shot to have a new voice or an you change a represent in California today none of the past [noise] well\nI I did notice that in one poll by writers it says and to UVA Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters to approve of President Trump a so I mean do you what do you want that support do you want to be the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat\nLook it's a it's a bit of an attitude that's for sure and my values and my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education\nMy mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so I'm as the author of century state or for California I'm as the leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage hikes for the country Fifteen dollars an hour and\nAlso the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo the carbonation agreed my values have always been for working families in California and that's why I'm I'm my goal is to be a new voice for a California's in Washington DC and\nIt's a it's an interesting to you that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down to ... he doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe in all California's deserve a real voice just going to fight for them on issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if you become the senator from California\nLaw to tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an oppositional position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust them in the schools and man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity tore values and to our people notice dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Cusick or say even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nI'm either Democrat and I'd be disappointed but I've got over and a couple of weeks and try to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that I didn't fight from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can allow one look tall aberration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of gross misconduct and said she ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner\nA Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a politics I don't support the investigation of Senator Dianne Feinstein but I Would have taken a different approach to Brett Kavanaugh on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals and basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nSenator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man and a new partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation and I would

First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a centers Richard Blumenthal I'm and I'm\nA descended from Minnesota uh be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously a delay tactic and\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee I Would have programmed to with my colleagues an end to the ... they don't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed and they I think a demonstrated a lack of leadership on behalf of the senior senator from California\nSo you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five Senate or find site eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate that she cannot well\nLet me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse and largest economy in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the sidelines and I think what California Watch\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the central threat that is before us climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children uh and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country\nYet we don't have that leadership or from California in Washington D. C. especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate seniority has not been working for California I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies a White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity\nTo our values and more importantly to our people so you don't think she is fighting for California [noise]\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California to the rest of the country um I think that the comedy um and there's bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this was very different ball game in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws\nAre I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for their values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Orlando", "day": "11"}
