Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nRight anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer might take Olivia\nFabulous well so how do we start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the one hundreds centennial until Robin burst\nCertainly knew about his work as we all would know about life story in in the king and I\nHad that you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it did you arrive in Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from box let's just listen to him and\n[noise]\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talked about hearing here now doubt or but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg variation turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all\nAnd it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robin had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because he was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crow Jay had pant ... that she was the most powerful a dance critic\nAnd absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nAh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called germ Robin affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer [laughter] you are going up Robbins worth as a ballet choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much visual as we can hear no doubt ordered afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of date me see I'm willing to do the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina tend to feel a cleric penny\nRobin muse and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\nOr or [noise]\n\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise]\nWell I I just loved the stamps\nAnd it's only about ten minutes twelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful Everytime [noise] it's not just a reimagining of the music better reimagining of ... version that he did in\nThe very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has priest was dancing around and stuff but he's practically a solar whereas Robbins imagined this as a ...\nWonderful do it I think we're simultaneously\nThe ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nA foreign and his dream girl who come and visit\nHim and with those two dancers tend to kill the ... was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves into practice mirrors\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking and I'm near as\nDancers sometimes to do in a studio said that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them in a way\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude towards things that had applied he was balancing loved dancers at a gathering which Robin made and found she said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat it the whole thing endlessly popcorn and that's\nProbably drove others you know off the cliff it left me a little dances at a\nGathering this is ah the dance Robin Hood to Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine he had been away from the New York city ballet can

day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis here and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty six team\nAt the appropriate time will release them like right now under Eighteen hundred nobody cares still and cares is you know you and a few people that have some question\nObviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe elections are easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns release Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German and ways and means just up the lane and yet Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law in taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd direct the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a pond receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner um but it can appoint agents such as a staffer at outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house\nFirst to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a similarly defended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further prohibition and the law that allows the committee after completing that investigation\nTo submit any of the information that it's a pain to the full house or the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote the committee were were resolved to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of reasons um could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been\nThat every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raising the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adult had including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations to their central Florida family more information including locations that Eileen Dole health dot com slash kids\nAction what is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances of the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety of reasons to principle one where they were\nCarrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch including the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials are the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns\nAnd because of the law they have to actually go to the president and request permission from the president and yet the tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlacing a blind trust his business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is my\nAh the the the Coolidge administrators from that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already have\nDo you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well\nThat's a tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be satisfied without knowing exactly what people want to see um I Would think that's a policy matter you'd want to see\nYou know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person\nLet's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut it give President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good system but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about it\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more as in terms of character simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be fairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nDean you broke your promise to\nSend a trucker goes to Nevada next time on here now [laughter]\n\nYou're listening to Ninety point seven it's two o'clock

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nOf him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud told you that Trump's simple relate a bull speak like huge big league or vaguely may have turned out voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earned county\nBut I think people base most of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level uh how ... they are there I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I set alarm I'm generally like Trump on most issues\nBut really likes his style they just like today is uh is moxie his feisty in is how he gets up every morning and um [noise] has a tweet storm and a six or to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was\nNot what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser in county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is at least not actually going to build the wall but he's going to he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him to literally by merely covering\nOr what he said we would get into widely discussions about this I said well that's the practice job candidate says something in the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much about ... who are out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable\n[noise] what about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump it's still\nPredominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising evangelical population Trump's evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote\nSo I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God she believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's\nAppointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nThat he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court\nJustices what about just the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county [noise]\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and entered the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's a enormous problem I'm just trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving as a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and uh working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd did they think that things have gotten any better under Trump maybe at the margins\nAre the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as a as a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really sabotaging Obamacare and there is no I'm neither Trump or the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nGoing up the budget he filed in February ... shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care\nAbout what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able\nTo do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because\nThey just like Trump its personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\n\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe cash and\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school um that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students said it smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school ended the policy our question is it the right thing to group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of stone in college and starkly black college for women\nThat'd be ... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts\n[noise] um I think it was well intentioned and certainly\nThere's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening for these teenagers because\nAs you write in your book in the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together and the cafeteria [noise] it seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening [noise] one\nOf the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest that a black boys in school in particular\nI'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girls and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior slain that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is I don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true\nIf you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nAnd the honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThen you are likely to think doing well in school being in that honest track is so called acting like\nIt's such a vicious cycle because very often the kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nAnd in fact tracking often does result in re segregation we'd end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings perhaps because they are less well prepared\nAnd maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed in those upper attracts you know the the\nDeliberate school so they looked at research it was probably yours and your book to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores are still not be placed so what to do about how to address this notion that perhaps a shift\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatricians are committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations who served central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nThe Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools that all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure had first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston entity suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's this sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you write another anecdote about\nA young girl who was in a school a majority white and the teacher was saying when you go to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we lived in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel\nEven more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved and uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like that there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little med school houses that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically and also they became more engaged socially\nWhy what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them\nSo if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and and be more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study um they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era\nAnd some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting and so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able
