Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new students made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for their immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story former welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is made of bed sheets in Fifteen cells how is that possible\nOh well that's a good question you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued to this management alert\nSaying these sort of more issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the officer the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from vents in so many cells I think there was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nThe should we imply then that that many people inside the sewer the worst suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would unfurl the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these nuisance and that the guard sort of laughed at them off and then called them suicide say there is when a\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside that building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\n... you know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a questions of untimely an adequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation\nAnd you know the thing about immigration detention is it's supposed to be what they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to\nHappen and so when you're using\nDisciplinary segregation in ways that are more curative that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned that doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth I'm like what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\nTo\nSupport for Ninety eight point seven news comes from Florida
