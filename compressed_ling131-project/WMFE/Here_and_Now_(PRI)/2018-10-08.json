Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nTo handouts stickers raising awareness about\nSexual harassment okay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine um well\nI mean among the founding of five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse in their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who have been involved in the women's rights movement has personally being\nUm victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight that\nOne of the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men in China only need a bachelor's degree\nYou know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal was that ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either and the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really\nOn the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda that rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do\n'em and say even today you see the legacy of that early communist hero because\nChina seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThat dissatisfaction with with this huge gender gap that women you know have to put themselves behind men and and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair\nWhat what is the threat that the Chinese government feels\nWell I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in wind ways\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing\nA particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the ... is that the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing that\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um said that the um much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's been encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population\nThe birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government as it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\n\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from done at least part Subaru south now with two locations deserves central Florida on west colonial drive and

private school if you did I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller [laughter] so [laughter] you should um\nGive it up we both love comic books and we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help\nHe is of mixed heritage and dad

he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics\nRight [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all the rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well ... what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think\nMost people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nSo how does the John in the book realized that understand I think\nHe's he's had to deal with sort of its ... and for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know stop or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have them have a pretty rich in our life\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children
