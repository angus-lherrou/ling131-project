to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are phoning in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey neighbor\n[noise] either go ahead I sew up\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly knowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide you fix systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to permanent system and so\nI'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing I Am and that's\nUm and identify myself and it's such a way it really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that much great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem with that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spend two don't trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what his village as he is\nAnd one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that to somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions don't require man he requires empathy empathy is carrying enough to respect another view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way policies math\nAnd these

so deep steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the ...

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of preventing the accused person to the innocence and then we can look whoa whoa that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which\nPeople know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we kept that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations\nAnd innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thought is accused of being guilty and the other way is when someone who's guilty but isn't it to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWith prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next problem is a a question of black and white thinking\nAnd this happens a lot where people get into arguments in extremes and so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between I'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you\nAre making everyone into a rapist or ... one that professor land but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the boss will crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence since and straw puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault\nWhich again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\n'em to finally um that's the question of knowledge and ... ton hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is and then say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nBut the temperatures will chop off of the high eighties\n[noise] United States and Canada have finally made a little piece in the trade war but some farmers who didn't come back we'll they still feel like they're under attack it because\nOf that we have been buying more local dairy for small to produce parents did just get a show our support for the local dairy ended up straight hair\nOn trial result very wars the marketplace\n[noise] [noise]\nWell the latest business news coming up all part of marketplace listening tonight from six to ... point seven\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from that I associate tough Winter Park where Dr Gary bunker Dr Sandra Barker in Dr Caitlin Kelly has been providing comprehensive and preventative I care to central Floridians for over Thirty years I\nAssociates of Winter Park is proud to support local public radio on W.

tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainties but as far as we can tell which there are a large moon about the sons of Neptune actually which is sort of strange\nUm orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can do\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the

net\nBut it's a pretty unusual well moon that big well it's certainly unexpected right wing or if\nYou look at the moon's in our solar system uh we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh\nWhen we spotted this we said to you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune that a sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this was potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nUh but uh you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of arm when we think of another body hitting the earth and knocking out a piece of writing it doesn't look like that and this case\nUh yeah it's right there so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth's moon ah\nMoons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planted in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus and then finally a capture scenario like a ... tunes largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads a little\nYeah we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know\nFor Ninety plain News Ken Hi Linda how are they now I don't ... hospitals building had been caring for the children and teenagers central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including mass scale ranking available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nOr the most successful way so far is using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the story over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well\nIn addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the plane of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet and so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so\nSometimes I planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this deaths this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nThey insist on that's the point I Want to pick up on because we came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right when did they doubt well\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and has the same as saying goes extraordinary claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job trying to rule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the storm\nCould there be another planted in the system uh that's that's pulling on this planet and making it wobble around a those are all plausible explanation ... uh but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nReally it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this natural very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about this\nMeasure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits it with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event ah we observed this system for about forty hours altogether so if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope or from the surface of the earth\nSo you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets from multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that are that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the once the ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope in ... a better for you guys were looking an excellent point\nIt's going to be like why yeah if it would be a spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a\nSitting aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine how people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out\nHow a James don't jaded just he won't have that problem and like I said the mere is going to be really spectacular so uh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly afford the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know there are times when I'm ...\nI'm not going to obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else that makes some law well we should have made it twice as big what you're saying whatever I Am\nSure yeah you know so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to well the we've talked about a W first and then there's a a telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah\nThat's a I I don't know who's working on it that it's it's a ultraviolet and read an optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and so uh that\nThey come up with great names for these things so there's going to be some ... test against material nasty will definitely be an an improvement on Hubble but you know how boys over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is All right so if this is a strange jar planet situation that you can tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd ah you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is that things going on here happened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here and that of course speaks directly to\nThis again this American Life wakes rank Camille send them an old photograph of herself and she's a little kid on vacation with your family in Canada and then I went back at the picture and I found my grandma walking through behind her\nWaking Camille grew up in different states committed no him at that age where his grandma coincidences do they mean anything this week\nI regard him this American Life can be heard tonight from seven ... seven W. N. F. E.\nHi I'm Patrick tongue and unfair to put myself in your shoes [noise] because [noise]\nEverybody has a different set of references everybody has a history and a different background [noise]\nListen to all things considered weekdays starting at ... pm [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nProportions squad one camera single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn out the the clock back for that time period ... or you have an entire chapter on catcher\n[laughter] well I was so and then they're not ... while you're devoted a well I read it I Know why or why the vote for you tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch it [noise]\nSo this is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato base conned about but\nIn the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of than nasty a sauce with a lot of vegetable ways and that people would put pumpkin ... people would put tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called our guys and then because the whole mess of it\nTended to kinda be rotten anyway they dumped preservatives and that like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... this kind of battle ground of food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil in a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products see reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz\nAnd he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said that kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz although he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent kids or some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety\nThe things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives\nI Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nPlus you know there was a major combat over the preservatives and get to her and that was pretty fascinating but\nLet's talk about a Harvey Washington where I only a little bit more than ... the focus of your book and the poison squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out food safety ever tell us about that what you want to be wondering why did you have to what was amazing it's\nJust crazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know\nAt completely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things and to human beings\nAnd that's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment\nIn which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time\nHad to be adding capsules of the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the poison crops squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at Sallis ... acid which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these are these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated him just want to you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller ...\nHis dad had been a preacher a farmer but also like to enter a preacher conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war and he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and widely real\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including is all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations that serves central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nAnd then he just starts feeling at a party is feeling the layers of it apart and the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government\n[noise] hang on ... [laughter] they can take a drink of water that are [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution promote the general welfare this is kind of how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is we stand up for the citizens that I think he became perceived as an advocate as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually did that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person\nWho drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually we're in we're in our laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can\nBe angry I Am so after you know he's like battling away stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the accidents that have the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug act of Nineteen oh six passed so much carried by that kind of title wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten this but that was the first great consumer protection laws\nEver passed by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you asked why he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nBut and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "05"}
