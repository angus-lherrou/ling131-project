said immediately they would begin investigating around us so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of things that\nAstronauts train for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you

is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voter security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure happen we security systems how does all of this affect voting behavior\nAnd our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for

founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nFire fighter beer and it's nice to have you um\nLarry I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and Charlie what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team when we're there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nA tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda an attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um\nThe first thing I Need to have a new one comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing some do they all had including this all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location sit there and central Florida family more information including locations that Eileen Dole health dot com slash kids\nUnclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but to suffer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there was something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems my actually I think they may still\nThey may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to attack them I'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and deal with registration databases\nI'm trying to pull books or what you can kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or to or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said a last I checked and I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the smaller indictments there was an indication that there was some\nDinner and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised [noise] well\nUm [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial question ... you mentioned\nUm well so let's start off by making distinctions and I and malaria really helped 'em um and making the distinctions among the Russians on what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think\nUm if we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um the first um just thinks that we would make is between\nYou know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to with the Twenty one states um they got attacked\nThose are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines are used in several states um or potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about the voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities\nAnd so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time\nAnd the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either have been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access\nThat in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them um you would need some sort of inside job um that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so\nUm but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community think it's easier to actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nDuring the day right\nUm well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to the my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election\nBeing there and a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there were mistakes and the programming so\nUm so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking\nThat the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see at DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nTrue I I could just jump in real quick point um I I I\nI I think that to to build on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course it is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nAnd yes she is fluent in squirrel monkey it's all on science friday from WNYC studio [noise]\n\nJust thinking this American Life lakes rent Camille send him an old photograph of herself and

campus tours is available at ... dot org\nBowls all things possible [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as\nRising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms and to ensure that we don't get too close to dance to degree tipping point\nThe agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase to just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does half a degree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change vi PCC this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report\nAnd tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is Dr Kelly da Vinci is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you on a treadmill to shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel tour they one of the half degree increase in global temperature all your worries are you worried about climate change impacting\nWhere you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for seven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday I'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree in Greece in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even a one point five degree increase is gonna brings a pretty big change [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely right so the entourage agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd good for example\nFor example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming\nOn at least once every five years is two and a half times worse\nWith two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about it on the ice free Arctic in the summer and when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted our species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates them lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects I'm\nAlmost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me which for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of the further declining coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent I which is just tremendous you know\nDoes it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay under your best to point zero degree\nWhat the report finds that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen on to make that transition happen on right now\nSupport for Ninety points of a news comes from Orlando

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nMeant by twenty thirty instead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year\nBy twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and de combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty or talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to make one point five pathways\nWe're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices on a lot of different measures I which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports won't go there with that can you can you answer at least two commission did what they do they use [noise]\nIs short so on and ... the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision on requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nAnd had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed\nAnd I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assess all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case and there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators con make sure that they feel comfortable with the arms the implications for policy makers so in this case\nI'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report [noise]\nMm [noise] oh we're a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice\n[noise] yes hello so I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up confusing\nTake but when you talk about one and a half degrees people aren't real excited about it what really hurts us in our culture\nIs the high temperature record highs so for example in the Midwest is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit or not it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to yield are in the Central Valley of California one tomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen\nAnd so this is really critical or the highs not just the average temperature and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American force grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the ... atmosphere it's cool the planet at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientists will talk about that because we can we can

in May of Nineteen fifty nine a small squirrel monkey from the jungles of Peru sat atop an American Jupiter rocket waiting her blast off into space\nMiss Baker was her name and after nine minutes of weightlessness she fell back to earth where she became an instant celebrity inundated with Leathers letters from school children and even mobbed at a press conference as\nOne of the first two American animal successfully launched into and returned from space missed bakers flight was studying how we humans might fare\nIn orbit in space but there's a lot to learn by studying these small cousins of ours right here on earth\nAnalyzing their communications the structures of their societies and their brainy ways that they navigate their world as my next guest says Anita stone and assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks\nWelcome to science friday thinks he has great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my\nChildhood as one of the first animal went into space wow why what kept you fascinated with studying square though\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I Want it to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research and I started reading about squirrel monkey\nAnd became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise]\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years they are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [laughter] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow a movie show how many do you study how many of the group the number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a ... that my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd if they do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome square one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day and the life of a square among [noise]\nSo square monkey to wake up really\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes

important teenage years later health has over twenty pediatric locations served central Florida family more information including locations that Arlen do health dot com slash kids\nUp or they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we follow them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\nFor their practice or twelve hours I got out here that they have a strange way of eating grass shop [noise]\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd out with a head up and then they bite off the head kind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and\nI understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a ...\nRight why don't why haven't they do that\nYeah so I've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are ness that Hank pretty low and once the adult lost desert than Nash\nThe adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] it was the last one I leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's\nOf of of of of one of the spider monkey sweats let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nI ... I said spider monkey everybody deserves that right yeah okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I Can't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver so um but when there is you know ten of them in a treats kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sounds a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm\n[noise]\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there's an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that ... that we hear is that rises there there's usually this is those are squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nMy ... ... it might be birds actually because once you sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notice is that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of\nBird how hard was it how much time as are taking you to know the difference in the study that sounds to me\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but um my field assistant who's a local field assistant\nHe's the monkey was for her and she knows everything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well the caller yes sometimes he does me like it she loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them a squirrel monkey\nYeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis and um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans\nThrough illustrations from children's books more details that Holocaust edu dot org\nJust thinking this American Life lakes rent Camille send him an old

science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every years Sam and go on the most important journey of their lives after living years in the wild wild oceans they must swim back to the coast to one very particular river mouth\nAnd then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this and we don't like\nAny good trip you need a map and not just a composition is telling you were north dues you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to use it straight north losing more north east east and south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\n... what if they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect the magnetic field lines of beer beer math is they're magnetic and what about their Olympic dwelling cousins and when you live fish living quiet landlocked lines you know\nLived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain Moore's Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said about but sandman live in pursuit of lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys pay\nThey it's it's pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\n... and then they usually actually these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in [noise]\nYeah this is a theme and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams uh they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and make make information\nNow I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon being laughed exam and what what makes them so interesting to you\nThis is rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in\nMaine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and I've never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\n... or ... and yet you found that they still have these jewel magnetic maps in there that they would have needed that they not been ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so CNN when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different\nComponents one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as ... field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAnother aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination ankle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're ... toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict are favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nThe super convenient because these radiance of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel so they formed a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nDo they have little magnets in their bodies that can do that\nThough there are the mechanisms behind lag NATO reception are are still unclear\nBut one of the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species have tiny chains of magnet tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic properties and so these chains of nine to tight are associated with nerve cells\nAnd the thought is that the change can be\nPulled by or strength magnetic field and so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials though these structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm now why why is it important to your wives and why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields\nWell it's a rather interesting question that we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species\nThat could go to the ocean retain a map sense just the point of curiosity and we also wanted to know or if it Lennox\nAlso possesses ability is another group of individuals that does ethnic naps of diverse and not know amounts of these days but we also wanted to know what happened\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno

health has over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nOld and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing we fish\nThough the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon where transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested and so we tested these individuals using a series of magnetic coil\nAnd essentially it's a series of wouldn't friends that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils that allows us to alter the direction and also\nThe average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know on great schools and if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnetized the metal in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the fish or you magnify them shutting their magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf there were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of night on tight right that somehow connect within ourselves\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate that movement fishing event by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of caffeine arenas we have one fish per ... and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nThought this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nOf our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scaled and I looked at those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "12"}
