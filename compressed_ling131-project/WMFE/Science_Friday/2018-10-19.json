we're way\nOver last talking about over ... this was just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting she sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction that that you write women who are wealthier who had insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's a it's an accepted norm is part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the promise [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women have greater education are more likely to ... and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\n[noise] um and it's a dairy and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery ends and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the score and still burst in preterm birth later and which I'm subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states for increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like\nAnd why they're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources they just don't have the facilities to producers area and sometimes when women really need to and I think it's important to to stay in the ... there are women\nWho and babies that that it is your life savings procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nWant to focus on a little bit above to what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr go thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this but there's also this idea of a\nPlan C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... in the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver I'm In our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year so while some of desk could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers meet you um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the right and it's very deliberate here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing in\n[noise] yeah I assume certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones to make a recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that too is responsible\nOn it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics or there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress string labor in terms of the cervical digression I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on him make quicker decision to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as an obstetrician is to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on\nPatients and families do say yeah um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes a highly what's your reaction to them\nAll I Would completely agree with her or the the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman is giving birth and is very instrumental um there are a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time that they're having a badge and of course and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that is going to help\nUh in her physiology two two best achieved

Israel Deaconess\nMedical center in Boston and lots lots of folks on\nOn the line and let's see we only uh gosh can't 'cause everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach deer compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it uh dictators in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing ... and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on that we have a very extensive review of the evidence and they found that mid with free was so saturated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um in reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by mid wise in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives\nAnd then the math that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst in the journal and in and out comes in the country and only one percent or berserk attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we knew how to model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have\nBetter outcomes are trying to go and you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a decade what did you do there [noise]\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence that the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications for their hands and focus very narrowly on primary ... um first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make\nSurgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people you see a heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definitions for progress in labor a old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than nowhere more modern data really proved to us we want it to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for the back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke there is a matter of Israel and I would you if you were only from so phone down here in Boston and so there's this old me mad at best to the hospital\nYou go to determine more or less if you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so I one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery race may vary by as much as ... percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environments\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Monday point seven W.

E. dot org\nIt's twenty minutes after three and this was not he points to have a\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the typical ... plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nThink about bees and aunts and spiders tiny as they are they're all vinyl parts of our ecosystem weather as food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hides mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful in Kenya individual behavior still took the hand of fate for the whole group or\nThe hives indeed the legion my next guest looked at these questions how his word is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumblebees and know a pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA looking at these social behavior of these ants and even spider [noise]\n\n... where did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but but you gravitated to bumble bee why was\nThat my did my PHD in a honeybee labs and but I went Robie and worked on bumblebees instead I started a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it was sequenced we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to honeybees bumblebees have a very different like go right ahead of the colonies gets started\nFirst honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social uh there's never a point in their lives in a life as a hobby queen where she's living on around\nThe bumblebees are different and they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony\nAnd nice queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring IDs queens half to crawl out of there over wintering thought\nAnd start their own that they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to him\nAnd you went brought an effort to show us what they look\nThey didn't stay you'll notice from the get go then it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that the ancestor to both of these groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOrlando Health network a pediatricians are committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years related health has over twenty pediatric location served central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nAre meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time really to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is a ... and swings my lab actually studies and um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused\nAnd the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... at home\nYou're brought some answers were ...\nHarvest friends from I'm here in California oh it's like so far she on the sidewalk ... probably the larger than what we are a little bit longer there but yeah and they're like ... even the ones you see on the sidewalk there were why are you interested in\nThese areas and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between nest sites so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they worried and how quickly they call their friends to food so another thing I brought here as a cast different asked to flip it over I was on its head oh\nShort hair and stuff like that that's a cast of an answer is yes you is there like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly faster players from Home Depot how far does that goes around and just the whole life I Know that's just the top part about\nSix or eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it to go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did one cast a zinc um which is a type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard things it's easier to dig around and it won't break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how deep they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee wonder about the drone and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones the drones don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that movie that when I was reading about this and that was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or for something called royal jelly but that's not what the ... do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nBut we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just haven't looked for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from the audience what started right or were there on the rights are just go ahead please\nUm my um my mom\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there is any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal\nHer when she gets styles that is a great question I'm allergic to bees to\nBack that up for ... you work with fever and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the\nTerrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were stung by being me too I'm does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response\nI that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the venom and it'd be interesting\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question but no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how worried are large different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of ... and so there's different types of ... and um there's some similarities and differences in first of all many of them live underground raised bees will and\nPut their hives inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example those honeybees in some species advance will relocate from one to say to another is so honeybees will go and look for a new nest site in ... the way the shape of the\nEntrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and to other and a little off there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is it again have small entrances and dark places or there's some similarities in some differences\nIs it going this American Life one month before Seventeen people died and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida school did this intense training everybody in the school mind revamped new procedures what they were supposed to do in case someone set up at school and started shooting and we wondered did it help\nSeventeen people Don did this ... does it make things worse\nTeachers way in this week [noise]\nI regard them this American Life can

night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience said his takes about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ...\nWhat is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules\nCould there be genes and work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome Dr containment Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los\nAngeles [noise]\nIs that right you have to get seven hours of sleep at night that's what the usual requirement is yes for\nUm the majority of long term studies\nThat have looked have found that if you get significantly less or significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night then that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah 'cause I get like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that's not\nAll that is not going to ... in all honesty I'm of a six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep and the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nYour memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects of you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nAnd I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what\nDoes it what about sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours the quality what what is one of the genes doing\nThat's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work than it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nOn the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day recently most of the night on what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restore the properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep and improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWell they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on in my most recent studied beam on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have had a lasso ... one is what's known as the clock Jane your clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it\nHas to be in and dodging the timing mechanism like gears not talk to my students about deals on the ... most of them don't lower collectors are [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones at the time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we look primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain\nAnd most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain entail\nThe print for any point in the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nLeap homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that are the hit on the goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep processing works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it's best to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from you know so when you say the clock is that the\nThe circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism in Austin late at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question overhear yes I have a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're\nSpeaking of itself so mapping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way\nThey win by yourself and that all I Do like one of the great\nThings about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon\nNo one can complain you can write at all I Know what I'm doing research [laughter]\nBut you're saying napping is important is the laughing is very important if you're not getting daily sufficient sleep and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not be getting um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but anything from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much of that suggests that there may be an issue\nHowever in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Orlando", "day": "19"}
