I ... are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it were dangerous and to not touch it not handle it ... ... and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether this person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber or wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other\nIssues with play in his making these devices once again we're talking to you by NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to ...\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando how to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nOr do they have any idea if the man they arrested today was acting as as a lone\nWolf attorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all the people involved in this right now we know that\nSees are say I guess the only person in federal custody I think it's the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help\nAny assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question\nWhat about the white van we saw pictures of it are on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspects because of course there were images\nOf the president there were also you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in his investigation but do we know anything about why investigators ah came and got to that than\nWe do know that Cesar ... was taken into custody in or near an auto zone business and that shortly thereafter people with FBI jackets and other law enforcement\nWere seen securing this white van and transporting it possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes authorities have not on the record yet connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question we do know that there was a massive manhunt under way for this individual that involve federal and local authorities across multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers\nInjured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were waiting this press conference from the Justice Department of but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of the story a Republican strategist Allison Stewart is with us now Alice welcome to you\nThank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at hill TV Jamal Simmons\nA speaker or ... or ALS want to start with you and you'll have a suspect in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this has been a very politically fraught\nPast couple of days it it has been in and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to the FBI and law enforcement and those who\nPut their their lives on the line to to make this apprehension so swift and I bring bring about a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very\nUh an intense time in in our politics I\nI I think if we're looking at this through the the political lens ... we have to\nGive some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause of this or the motive of of this is a this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law\nAnd to write league claimed and called this despicable a despicable act of political violence and it's time to\nHave peace in the United states you know\nI'm Sorry I interrupted you ... do you want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really wanted him to do I really want him to try 'em I support it so far that every time a ... out on the she'd give his words that are about something up so like so and then ... minutes or hours later it does or does or something\nThat was to blame on the victims let the media\nOr you know tries to lessen this in some way to make light of it in some way and I think the president um his job right now and not altered his job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president\nAnd do something well maybe he called President Obama may be called President Clinton and awkward has is health and and and made sure that the FBI all the other\nSources of their disposal they were protected you know image toward the attorney general Jeff Sessions all ages older to make sure he was going to be okay but this was a moment we're supposed to reach out and not just for the words but also with actions from\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those do home the um the the male bombings or bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder if he could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of his band he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alice advise leaders of the party to address\nIt more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it's it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send the message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and uh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions\nBe heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say that in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a farm in a consistent message and as your most editing need not be Justin word but also an action\nBut that's the big um um\nPiece of the puzzle here that people are are obviously on a ... to find out ... and ... will have to see whether we get any clues is out of that sort of\nLuke William hunt former FBI special agents I Want to ask you one more question before I ask you a to hang tight or what your thoughts on the fact that these ...\n... ... exploded\nNot one of them does it is it assigned to you that this suspect was a bad bomb maker or that but you know he he didn't want them to explode\nWell I'm ... you know this is this is what I'm\nCompletely uncovered and one thing that you see what this kind of thing is just sort of jumped to sort of terrorized equal um even if you have someone who's not capable of actually creating a a a an active devices could explode a this is obviously a ways to terrorize people are just sort of get back\nAt the other side if there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's that's um probably the the the big I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang hang with us if you can ah NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and match important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI's New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderers row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I\nHave a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department answer unanswered questions\nDid he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's tire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed such a package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help and what he was planning next if anything asked for motives it's not clear right now there is a a social media account that's been linked\nTo the suspect fifty six year old she's there say our Crump South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who haven't been to address the use of these suspicious packages and that's the one hand tests to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson um ... just to to reset for the audience who are we stand now is already the rest of the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is either say oxygen to six years old and dressed in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned that a democratic primaries are Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of one or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages and he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said it's confirmed that a suspicious package mailed to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California he\nSays we're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity ah during this very a dark period where many prominent Democrats had the ... ah recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions that you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far though the people who've gotten these packages had been critics of the president\nI'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next year that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people how former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking a yellow mental envelopes with panning that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course on some of the targets or um or intended recipient of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper\nAnd another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet without have\nAll those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAh for the vast majority of those packages\nThe FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages you know the images that you have seen\nJustice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI\nFor Ninety point have the news comes some more land out how to cover their whatever whenever and wherever Orlando healthy dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six patients can't taste more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nAnd had described as as Kerry just said what the packages have looked like\nIt at one point or if there are packages that are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either this suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe some buddy who is a a copycat as often happens in cases like nice\nYeah yeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know it's obviously are easy to get some of these materials that it's\nA lot of materials or or the town and so it's really going to take a a a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same suspect over copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of by the ... FBI a lab all back in the field office\nLooking at the actual friends ex um so it's not going to be an easy call a quick call until it's actually had a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah [noise] oh that's\nThat's a great question I mean I think as a as a couple of things so first there's got to a charity destruction so um if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have\nA sense of ... ... you know what his lowly age what else is out there the other thing is just as a collaborative and the electronic yeah but it's it's you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records\nThat late give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or this caller business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive each threats are so I Would say within the next you know twenty four hours\nYou're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a done it in ... Asian or they should have a good idea of how far does go on with this particular suspect but then there's all the question of\nAgain isn't working with someone else a tracking down any potential each other a associates that made it healthy\nAs far as the eye special agent ... William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it'd be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrested happened today just very quickly we know that there was a white van with all sorts of political decals apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it do we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the sense that he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to this aspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when it's a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they act\nAnd does see this I actually individual you're talking about a fifty six years old ... Florida where he is he right\nNow he is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as authorities are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety we have gotten a warning\nOr in why did he detectives along with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force\nThe J ... New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to ... police command might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing relationship has never been stronger\nHis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought to justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service in it for intel bureau ... a counterterrorism bureau\nOr patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN ball help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset we would identify and arrest the person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have no ability to investigate it delivered a precise matter\nTo me Suresh means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe but its director ... said that might be more packages out there so everyone's still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight and ...\nFor Ninety point haven't come some more land out how Catholic or whatever whenever and wherever Orlando it's dedicated to providing many planes I care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six I'll pay some more information is that he's done in their house dot com\nTime we've been listening to special coverage of the Justice Department press conference on NPR him see\nYou also to the

assistance Chile I can say this is the way law enforcement supposed to work this was a mess of investigation what's the what's a collaborative effort and was well coordinated with each agency bringing a special expertise to the table\nBut I Would also like to recognize the mini postal employees who we think of as a as an ears were appreciating the diligence and awareness in fact it was a postal employee this morning that alert us to one of these suspicious parcels\nWhen postal inspection service have a great deal of expertise in responding to an investigating suspicious mail postal spectators are trained to wreck respond and investigate dangerous medals in the mail these dangerous ... specialist ... in the ...\nFortunately in this case none of the devices detonated and there was

and confidence in the men women of law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who worked there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print\nI was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves a it's important to say as as is in the complaints\nAre they even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not ah they were functional as they say so we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which is subjected to the right\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of might be point seven W.

I was you know I was ... he was you know I and I\nMean can as it was ... you know get an idea had the rattling much vibration that really was in\nFact we at like ... I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really ... in a highway ... when did you think\nOn a personal level I really enjoyed it I I don't for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you can really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly in space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really a fun way to habit movie made\n[laughter] I said for throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of his engineering mindset here's this here's a clip\nFinancing emerge over to the moon bus sure what what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise] Neal where you take anything a set of choices they force you\nI think that's a real quote you meant you know right I did I did I I met him once I'm\nAt a conference I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way a ... I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie I really think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak to engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drunks and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really affect what she has served as you went as you knew him and well I didn't really I don't think I knew him that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps Dower is portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about\nUm you know there were some serious problem struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues mask grown up so you know I think it's a bit of both the was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but uh but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out [laughter]\nYou know you didn't get that impression too much in the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life the record concentration diligence\nAnd there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies do you see that there's an engineer and there's a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair perfect portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult all the scenes of space flight were there you had a Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying ... news you'd was that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people assume you have this fun floating and feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room\nThat you are really crammed in there the cockpit but right in your face the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride up hill can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nLet's go to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nAndrew are you there\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnected there for a moment [noise] um yeah I was saying it just sounds you added to the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans to space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for calling you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seat you know to go landing on them oh\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and they asked for an office there were I mean there are other candidates for the job but for sure the Gemini eight experience was a a really key point I was a really dangerous missions\nAnd I was just looking at all life magazines from the month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really kind of an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of successful failure in that sense but a a a fantastic a moment captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very hard to say I'm a big emotional punch of the story was and Neal's grief\nOver the death of his daughter when she was just two years old and then the loss of the fellow astronauts on the lead up to Apollo you know living in Palo one whatever you think these humans lots to shape history has has played out\nI'm Eric glass on this American Life would bring you report from the world's most dangerous battlefields\nPinching your cheek right now pressure pointing actually\nLike the back seat in the family car three brothers but the oldest in the middle and basically and the mediator\nI haven't actually not you and me I mean I just don't like ...\nThat many of the stories that don't fit the daily news shows this American Life [noise]\nI regard him this American Life can be her tonight from seven or Ninety point seven W.

Carroll Janice and um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration very few went and\nAsked me was the first African American woman to go into space exploration and not only that she just seems like a like a really cool person outlet that mean she's done dancing and acting with on Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and\nI'm sure it's not very inspired by the civil rights and the thing I just feel like she's just all around up really multifaceted fascinating person to do a movie at that and I'd love to address the something about her or him you're nodding very\nMuch in agreement oh yeah I may Jonathan ... is very cool I I met her a few times and it's just always a treat to talk\nTo her about can you tell us a little bit about her history and\nUm I I think pretty much what the college that is what I Know of her and she's just like like a really interesting life filled with a lot of different things from science to the earth\nIs you\nAre on a genocide that yeah there are certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early ones for women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell her\nI said yep some movie I think there would be amazing stories or um you know life is amazing\nAnd then there's a treat from a tweet from apple says how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly or perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did for\nSomething like an interesting topic and there are all these behind the scenes stories right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] if that's the mystery that Thirteen rate I so I I they're I Believe in some kind of Netflix theories about about them all set up some kind of documentary series that was regarded as\nYeah um and all the people who were in that control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting of it this this is a movie um about inroads have astronaut certainly fifty years ago and you know at least fifty\nYears since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff\nWires Hollywood still talking about things that happened fifty years ago when so much has happened since when do you think\nYeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it is that you know Apollo landing on the moon that was that at the big stuff like that was the big sets it human exploration has has done in the last\nSeven years I mean that that shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that uh\nAnd that sounds like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get their view\nOf it when I when we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and their Maryland's on other places yeah any you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in the space for ... there are so many other asks if there are so many countries up there\nRight now I mean there is a story to be told us to tweet about the Russians I think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're [noise] hold their travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like um there's many ways to make sense for into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those\nAre sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think maybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back worlds with imagining the\nFuture is your what are they talking about a NASA these days about\nSo what what are big project is actually trying to get back to the mood so that's a riot SOS programs and all of exploration systems element so you know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told\nAnd one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering at how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell what it takes to actually get\nThe bar for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways Akron care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nYeah I Would I Would think it'd be interesting to make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop the launching a and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it and then in the affected them in ways that many people though of course it killed the crew but oh I think that many of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nI have to have a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made on the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and ah I'm On I'm sure it will be you know a crucial to understanding the accident\nYou measured you mentioned the rhyme mission that wants to get us back to the moon is it usually\nGoing to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Paul\nIn order to know I'm getting to the moon is just as hard today as it was in the Nineteen sixties I mean we know a little bit more we have an experience base of one to draw from a but actually going to the moon mission is going to be justice risky it's\nJustified to do um the amount of a prop we name when Neal said he wished for more ... I Wish for more prop every day as well um so it's not any easier getting to the moon and it does risky I'm the second time around\nI remember after the ... the Apollo missions were cancelled the three rockets leftover we only went to Seventeen are supposed to be twenty I remember going through Houston and seeing them lying on their side one lying and so I did as a home\nFor nesting birds and I never thought there was anything as sad as seeing a Saturn five being home for you know it's nice to birds out of places and this was the most ... if in a building now and it's been restored I Know that has\nBeen when we just turn that's put back individual assembly building and loan I mean\nIf they if the avionics are quite out of date at that point I don't know if we can control it anymore [laughter]\nWhen what's the schedule for that and do we have enough money and is it going to be going\nOut so we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of the last uh and really the second launch of a Ryan we launched in twenty four came for the first flight of her eye on 'em and that'll be an unproven flight we are going around the moon or through a distant retrograde orbits little even go way past the moon about Seventy thousand kilometers on the far side and that will be a long mission just\nReally a shakedown all of the vehicle systems", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "26"}
