just wishes by us\n\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots as isn't always but people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon [noise] they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room bus their squares and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds item\nOperate in this\nSo this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it on line\nThat's when the item gets ... notice\nProvided the items\nThat you know\nAnd then one idiot how many they need to\nPick the back massager a second worker cause the orange robots over retrieved massager from the shelf and then put it on the yellow train kind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor\nBelt state and I and I played that we're going to say\nStation is what it sounds like basically the back massager comes in on a yellow tray and the worker pack sent into box\nNo robots here this is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy actually if I can sell a\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo of stuff she's seen someone order\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it\nYou can do that we worked our today\nWorkers normally do for ships so so if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week [noise]\nSo the very last thing that happens here back massager is that it gets a shipping labor all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nLabel is rated and gently place to err on top of the [noise]\nThat sound you hear on the air is placing it on\nHard I have to admit it's literally my favorite [noise]\n...\nSo the robots or Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I I find that my mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two they're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands of Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says the speakers are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time\nAnd a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom\nBreaks because they feared not making work quota and\nThat workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nOn responded that they didn't recognize these allegations as accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quota\nAnd that's our attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high while I'm an Amazon I learn about this you know we\nDon't have power over my individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great place with great team members and great benefits\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAnd its on primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with officiating\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voice concern [laughter]\nSo without strong worker protections and in an ever shifting workforce are these the jobs\nThat the graduates have Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place
