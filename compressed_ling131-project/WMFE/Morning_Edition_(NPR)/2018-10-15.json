said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and who's the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country I'd be bar faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Graben\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the

the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how\nGlobal business is this\nMore and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon Shabaab hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nIf Katie's the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're probably your global sales have been outpacing\nYour domestic sales as well and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ... from the\n... but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay some domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements debate well a ... year agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nWe don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer in and hopefully you have people leave converting some scotch you remain Berman drinkers or you take your profits back a\nWhich means less investments back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState in the obviously the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a law that has um [noise] when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having inflicted feelings [noise]\nAh I think we all understand there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with the um ... again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue yet if you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows we're probably means you Kentucky or he will\nNote for the non geographically minded right across\nThe river yes ah in and he tells you understood exactly that this decision could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks very intensive federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States I'm like holy Damon sandwich announced they could move some production overseas we can't do that with ... and you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make the\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you could start to see some real long term consequences is one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so that we converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from a standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were\nDrinking before you know we might

Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to the to the previous well\nShe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature part isn't in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump put it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing complicity and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh what was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in the small he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp said Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich likes most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is a murderer or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nPM American public
