there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting out alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia

president can be able to speak directly to the goblet\nBut this is where Dr Read lender has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe share of the fact that the president might be using such as you do for political purposes or get great version of the presidency was under threat for whatever reason so I think it'd be so what about it but\nThese are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and that wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\n[laughter] famous says that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for

Washington DC shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to ask you to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them this on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals and enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ruins the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized that thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies are in development that could do things like fight cancer we

Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the cabin our case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons or any potential witness for victim is um let's say taint him\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing sang just because they might have difficulty answering the question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromise door hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower

process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee found to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process and that and how does it affect their legacy or not but\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations that presidents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice vote and some have drawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that it's not controversial or not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a year and they've been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty that Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected censor at lunch but by the way he was also the fish to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with his confirmation process what does happen to nominate after a contentious fight like there's\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his ship and went on to write books make

newsreel Parkland\nThe war and read the turning point as a fresh start up and I'm starting to move on the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines to plan that MacArthur devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans as a threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he swept this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division his name is general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very precious and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nAnd none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots\nOn you know this was Hector calf Retta\nWho um receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nPlenty of thousand factories are chosen reservoir slog than there are ways to be bitter miles to the evacuation for devote enough to snow but I think guys as they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops return North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korea leave by someone who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and a escape to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reached soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murders he had to hide out in a house in Seoul\nHe hid until American forces entered the city blasting into ruins\nIf they took it back to\nThought the capital city of\nMedia volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in North Korea has gone\nBy ... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\n[noise] he was assigned to guard a bridge in his hometown a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south leave\nBy ... survived the war and emigrated\nTo the United states he is now Dr Levi ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book because this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime long\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a\nPeriod where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand in Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there's such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship [noise]\nHampton Sides is the author of on desperate ground the Marines at the reservoir\nCame at the same time of the FBI was trying to corroborate those charges of possible the agency has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check years and is not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious\nBreaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described\nThe sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nCatch that this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations what it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty apparent to the people who usually do those the local police\nWere falling at a little bit or some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or whose watch the TV has turned his sons or any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying and doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slowed non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case which is Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate early\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators while it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances gearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of the offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax where the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury to the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin caused the NPR News\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nGood morning you're listening to MORNING EDITION of every point seven WM every I'm Schoenberg and have you been on our website lately well we're W.
