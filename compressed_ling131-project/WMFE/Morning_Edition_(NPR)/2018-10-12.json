ah how what kind of impact you see this hurricane having on the ... elections in Florida\nYou get you can register online but I Believe that the the secretaries directive did not include extending online registration just turning in physical applications at the supervisors office\nAside from outside groups calling\nFor an extension you know be at the Democratic party or Florida or other groups do supervisor relations themselves have some sort of science saying look we don't think it's reasonable to you know to to have this deadline fall into that does we need a little more time to do kind of get together an advocate for an extension of is the need for it\nWe we have not I don't you know it is set in law when a book closing occurs and the governor is the only person who can extend that\nMhm [noise] and speaking about the fact that you might you have to make sure you've got a plan in place for hurricane season hum is pretty important of course do a voter registration offices are late kind of hot and like emergencies that I have a little more resilience as far as making sure the storm ready\nRight I guess I mean our building we have we have we are built a little bit better than the average belly but we have county buildings that are available to us that can withstand the storm that we can move our equipment in Osceola county and if this had been us that's what we would have been doing\nIt would be living our equipment into our you know ... our polls the equipment that goes to the ... locations in early voting sites\n[noise] we would be moving it ended as safe buildings\nThe biggest obstacle I see right now especially for a supervisor election bay county is the destruction of polling location ... uh because once they're gone I mean voters don't know where to go that in ... and communication is limited\nAnd it is a real problem if there is no longer a building there for me to go ... hold early voting or how have as a polling location I have a problem\nRight so what would you do in that situation would set up a tent do some kind of put on\nOur mobile unit or with a you know our workers are trained to process though there's the old fashioned way on paper if we need to and we were I that's what we would would that is what our plan calls for is mobile units are like the FEMA trailers or setting up tents\nYou in Osceola county has some of

office is\n... and then what about sort of staffing up because I imagine a lot of those stuff some of them that that might be having to deal with the devastation and their own house\nOr they may not be there right they may have evacuated so I mean you know what we try to do this work is an organization and I didn't know that in the past or their staff as from other counties have gone to help if they need the case not that we all don't need all the staff that we have right [noise]\nUm ... just bring it back into the conversation or what about the up and your neck of the woods I'm a ... in in Tallahassee what are you hearing as far as uh the the the registration divide there any sort of ... on on whether they have to sort of put put push things back and when I bought ...\n[noise] um I have not gotten any specific word or seen any a specific movements\nI'm On that are just yet I'll be tuning in to see\nWhere things are but I'm just as we're talking to you I see from the Gillum campaign like you know politics is it is back I'm I'm an ad um highlighting the Tampa Bay times\nUm article regarding the I'm Renata Santos over health care and um his position on that three weeks of how he's been pilots so you can kind of feel that things are sort of a with the campaigns getting back\nTo normal but I'm a to the question of the attack ads I'm from uh archery drew it I'm One of the things that was different compared to the other attack ads convert to Senator Bill Nelson and others in the gubernatorial race I'm Rhonda synthesis here's a pack rat was particularly about\nHurricane response from her me so he was different it wasn't just a normal the attack like the others that\nWere that they weren't taking down this one\nWas about a storm a couple of years ago and uh if\nIt had facts wrong and all that stuff but a while I was in South Florida and I have emergency this ad as we're waiting for Michael to to make landfall of like wow this this is really pushing it out there\nAnd that must be a little but I'm kind of blurring the lines but if you're seeing an attack which has footage from a previous storm showing a mayor or some other elected official in their official capacity probably going to be black and white as these attack ads normally I or some\nKind of do coloration but if you see that and then you you contrasting that was with a live footage of that same elected official kind of trying to get an emergency message out that's that is sort of blurring the lines away the right\n[noise] yeah yeah it is a learned wise and whoever is seeing that messaging at a uh\nThe thing about storms or or storm coverage it's twenty four hours and everyone were all glued to the TV so [noise] um the the free media that these candidates received during their active\nDuty and I'm I'm sure being president on top of things you would hope that drowns out the message of campaign\nAds which campaign ads are not necessarily factual at all I'm outside of these that are in question um so yeah it just blurs the line but I'm In the end we're all watching for that day\nTo day minutes two minutes update of the actual storm ad where these candidates are being interviewed by the media outlets were listening to their words and I'm I'm hopefully not too much about the commercials rebuild support\nRight but I Do know that in some of those press conferences there was some questions law from from the journalist about about these attack ads specifically in some of the sort of politics of of the rice it wasn't just about storm response and recovery in preparation\n[laughter] yeah and it's um ... you can watch to see how they respond to it some of them try to pivot\nThe best way they can and I'm with these cost terms like oh we're it's it's not a time for partisan show up um we look ahead and all that stuff so [noise] during the storm a and a ... can I can attest to it like uh it it showed\nWhat the candidates I'm can do and it helped\nThose who are actually in positions like the governor mayor Andrew Gillum bought those opponents like Ron defensive they didn't have that that bully pulpit so it was they're not getting that spotlight I'm so they were doing what they can outside of a with those ...\nAnd let me bring you back to this conversation ... I'm Sorry obviously if you're getting airtime whether you're talking about a storm or anything else that essentially as you're getting your face in front of the cameras you're getting your message out there\nAnd if you're in a leadership position that as as you said before it's kind of a test of your leadership ... your your um abilities to organize and\nAnd uh respond that um [noise] a lot was saying about uh the bump in in in polling that's a a governor Rick Scott God's after the twenty Seventeen storm season but he didn't invent this kind of method of of ah of responding right that this kind of goes back some wise\nIndeed ... Floridians do judge will\nAs all voters really may do judge their elected officials on crisis response in particular if you're an executive official\nGovernor mayor then leadership is expected during these times and so this goes back I mean in in sort of modern Florida Times union goes back to Hurricane Andrew in London child who was initially criticized a little bit\nFor the slow response to Hurricane Andrew although then it really geared up and he he went on to reelection or Jeb Bush back in two thousand four when we have for for hurricanes hit Florida and like forty days I mean it was a very short period of time again his popularity went up\nHe was not on the ballot that you're about his brother was running for president and you know it was on the ballot about two months after the storm said and some people think that that helped\nA George W a little bit you know ... sort of a you know ... the positive feelings about Jeb maybe rubbed off a little bit on George W and before we\nJust picking up all the idea of public safety what about the idea of gun safety because you know land those kind of been the epicenter of this debate of the young ... and that was really brought to the forefront was the the post shooting what are your thoughts about trying to tackle something state wide that much um address that issue\nAgain drawing back on my experience I Will tell you that what happened down in Parkland that individual that essay on have been reported to\nCounselors teachers different law enforcement agencies and the problem was number one nobody communicate that nobody shared that information so that kind of fell through the cracks the second thing is you can have somebody in law enforcement who's three years in their career\nAnd they are great police officer there great deputy sheriff but they have never been trained in how to assess and evaluate people based on either psychiatric or a psychological profile\nAgain going back to talk with the Florida sheriff's association for police chiefs I really believe that FDR league needs to bring on psychiatrists and psychologists who can do nothing but assess these threats as they come in and make these evaluations to these people need to be corrected do they need to be a investigated more thoroughly\nDo they need to be vetted through other agencies and you have things like red flag laws if they're deemed a threat credible threat to themselves and others and they have firearms and a musician perhaps that needs to be a wave that we can avail ourselves to pull those back from those people\nDo you think you might run into some issues that are trying to roll out some some tougher restrictions then I mean are you going to start infringing people sick an Amendment rights\nWhere you have to understand this was not going to happen to a lot of people in the course of anything else you have to be deemed a credible threat to yourself or others\nAnd by that means I think we are talking about a very small number of people but if we're going to try to protect ourselves these people that are psychologically or or whatever cannot handle the responsibility of having either a firearm more ammunition [laughter] that may be something that needs to be looked at what\nAbout people who have died have mental health red flags and what's the question how would you then that states whether they're a threat or not if somebody doesn't have some psychological issues that might disqualify them from getting a firearm\nHave they have are posting things on the Internet and they were written anything they've made any threats or have their neighbors reported them to have any issues of domestic violence or violence isn't bummed themselves\nSo law enforcement are they not already keeping an eye on those things I don't believe so and that comes down to watch is more resources into that area\nIt does it comes to an training comes down to resources and comes down to understand his law enforcement has changed a lot over the past ten Fifteen Years or what we asked the men and women law enforcement to do is not just stop the current issue a ticket anymore we're asking them to take on more and more responsibilities\nAnd I believe it goes back to we have to be able to train them adequately we have to equip them adequately so they can handle these additional responsibilities and if you're having a front line officer\nCome up to up the house and and interact with somebody who they called him that's a threat they have to be able to think to themselves do I need to have this person or a ... do I need to have this first report up to somebody else that can evaluate them that's better prepared to evaluate them that's the process in the process has to change\nAnd if you're talking about by correcting that gets into the realm of mental health um yes it does treatment or are we putting enough resources into into mental health assessment and evaluation and treatment than the state of Florida no we're not and how do you change that\nWell it's going to have to be a budgetary issue is going to have to start the county level because that's where you're dealing with people or the sheriff's office new municipalities and that's where I think after you all you can in the bottom line is we have a lot of different agencies are that don't talk to each other that don't communicate that don't share information and I think if we can\nIf I get to Tallahassee and work with these days I met one of the things would be to just share that information we designed emergency operations as we also have things called fusion centers\nWhere you're bringing different entities under one roof so they can they can share things they can talk they can they can talk about the cases they're working on or things that they're following they can talk about trends that are happening in their community\nAnd it's the same thing you've got to get the Winter Park near Orlando is the main ones and you pop is talking to Orange County they've got to talk to the FBI which the metropolitan bureau investigation they've got to talk to after you leave and then they've got to share that information with ... Lake County ... county ...\nYou're listening to into fictional naughty points even use them at the pity was talking to Stockton Reeves he's a Republican candidate for Florida's house district forty seven\nIn central Florida I mean all of these things you you talk about trying to make communication lines that uh but then other issues you mentioned it's a budgetary thing some of these things are going to be expensive it how do you pay for it\nWell that's a very good question and the bottom line is I Can't tell you right now that we're going to pay for this by doing wife it's a it's a matter of getting in there we were able to go Tallahassee after the primaries over and talk to some of the committee chairman's\nWe go to is really like a round Robin I mean I had ten minutes to talk to this chairperson this policy person this policy person we haven't had enough time to do ourselves to dig down into what is really an a to point\nOr eighty eight point two billion dollar budget what's available wants there and I understand that over fifty percent of the budget is set by the time you get Tallahassee with the outlays entitlement programs and other programs so they're very very little about of that budget that's really available for\nLooking at new programs are reallocate money but that's one of the things I Would like to delve into\nWhat about education because that is an issue that is close to a lot of people's habits what do you think's important to focus on a from an educational standpoint if you were elected to the Florida House of representatives and how would you go that implementing that vision\nWell in my family we have the ... Family Foundation that provides a financial scholarship to a child that went abroad high school who is\nAcademically qualified but financially disadvantaged and we've been doing that I'd like to see us on TALK taught my parents I mean we can do to boot in Oak Ridge to my emphasis is a little different as my moron K. through twelve education I have two children\nSupport for Ninety planes at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nI you know and I do think teachers are underpaid I really do for the job they do my sister in law's a teacher knows county and education is something that's near and dear to our hearts\nTo how you pay teachers more\nAdult comes back to the budget\nRight everything comes back to money doesn't um and again I don't have a a ready answer for that per se but I think if we can get up there and take a look at where the money comes in where the money goes out [noise]\nUm there's got to be a way to come to my son's high stakes testing is something that a lot of people have some thoughts about what's your thought on that and what do you think needs to change their if anything now I Will tell you I think we test too much\nI I went out and knocked on about twenty five hundred houses and of course the primary in Iran and to about thirty six different teachers and every one of 'em the very first group plan to her was we don't teach the more we have so many tests that come up to the course of the year that we know testing we're teaching our kids how to take this test so the teachings really been taken out of the classroom\nAnd you look at it I think it was Oregon and Washington state have decided that for next year they're not going to do any testing okay there's going to limit that go back to teaching a I think we do test too much I Would like to see us cut back on someone that testing because so much of what that school\nFrom when I hear from diminished traders is based on the test scores is what's going to get back to allocate for the budget and that is going to drive what happens at that school and so you really moving away from what you should be doing which is teaching and to testing and using those tests to make sure that everything comes to the terms of funding for the schools are just letting the teachers teach\nUs about transportation to because mass transit is something that probably could be improved here in central Florida do you have some thoughts on how that might happen\nYes ironically when I was in high school to build that I took a youth ledge was a high speed rail bill\nI didn't get very far in youth ledge but I've always been a proponent of high speed rail I worked in Washington for two years and I use the metro up there probably every day that I worked there ... or the problem in central Florida is that we've never really been able to look twenty Thirty years down the line\nIf you're in downtown Orlando and you live out in the suburbs you're going to find out there's very few east west arterial routes to get out there and so if you're driving down a Loma or colonial\nThe lines are packed up the cars are slow it is frustrating\nUm I really think if we can get our high speed rail here on the floor on the weekends working at night connected to all aboard Florida connected to a bright line\nAh and then be able to do the feet of routes get people going on buses and get people to you know what we're doing in terms of building housing near where these stations are I think is a good thing people can live and work and walk and get to where they need to be\nAnd a lot of you know transportation has changed me you know a couple of years ago there was no such thing as Hooper left you know there was no ride sharing a economy out there and so now it's easier for people than ever before\nTo get from point a to point B even if you don't even own a car when I was on the house during Winter Park one of the things that we we realized was an issue was\nThe people that lived there couldn't get to work because they had to they had to walk from Margaret square to Lee road or something I too so we tried to work with links to bring a bus in there to get those people where they could have access to transfer ... did you succeed\nAh unfortunately I got off the board before we were doing it but I remember those meetings with when he's working with our executive director and they're trying to push that very diligently\nStuck and raise I Want to ask you about the way you've campaign to because there has been some publicity around some of the ... that have gone out targeting you're punishing this rise out of ... do you think that was a mistake on your part labeling Harris to extreme to open up a central Florida\nMatthew that wasn't an attack on her character that was a reflection of her character in those words that we put on those flyers were not my worst or not anybody else's words\nThose were her words those words were hyper partisan they're rich stream they were radical and when you get out there and chant hey hey ho ho capitalism has got to go in this country was built on a crushing I think people need to hear that", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "12"}
