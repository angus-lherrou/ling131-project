story starts with a quiz here's your quiz master Noel King\nIt comes from political scientist John heading at the University of Nebraska that he's going to describe two towns and you have to guess which one is liberal and which is conservative here's ten number one\nThe schools would stress you know patriotism and respect and it would be a very rules based on educational system the how this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept a beautifully green and mowed a town of be quiet with lots of churches\nAll right and here is ten number two\nThe schools would be based more on experience all kinds of things rather than than rote memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those than church is\nNice quiz with probably pretty easy for you and to explain why we're joined now by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam Hi center I Know so the first time I'm guessing was conservative and the second one was liberal right\nExactly not hitting is drawing a fairly traditional stereotypes about liberals and conservatives conservatives prefer order and rules liberals prefer experiential schools and community theaters\nNow those stereotypes which means that they're going to be liberals who hate community theaters and conservatives who despised churches but the question that hit being and others are asking is\nHow come the stereotypes are so often accurate\nIf being liberal and conservative is all about our political views how come these labels describe all kinds of other things about us from the kinds of food we prefer to eat to the kinds of poetry we left\nTo where we want to hang out he's arguing that our political views spring from something deeper than just our beliefs about the government or small government\nPrecisely he's arguing that political preferences at least in part\nCompromise psychological and biological predisposition is\nThe most compelling evidence for this comes from studies involving large numbers of twins some of whom are identical and some of whom are fraternal\nIdentical twins share the same genes fraternal twins share fewer genes identical twins tend not to have more political preferences in common than fraternal twins do even though each ... presumably shed the same family and bringing\nHeight for example turns out to be about eighty percent a heritable when you're subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent or he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology yes and of course\nThat couldn't Lucian upset a lot of people\nAnd they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know I've had thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nWhat he and his colleagues are saying is that biology and psychology play a role in our political preferences snow all\nLiberals and conservatives in the United states often accused one another or stupidity or malice but it's ... and his colleagues outright one reason we might not see the world the same way is because we simply not lie at\nFrom a PM American public media\nSupport for

C. dot org\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep the story starts with a quiz here's your quiz master Noel ...\nIt comes from political scientist John ... at the University of Nebraska he's going to describe two towns and you have to guess which one is liberal and which is conservative here's ten number one\nThe schools would stress you know patriotism and respect and it would be a very rules based on educational system but how would this would be fairly similar the\nLawns would be a very nicely kept to a beautifully green and mode or the town of be quiet with lots of churches\nAll right and here is ten number two\nThe schools would be based more on story actual kinds of things rather than than rote memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those than church is\nNice quiz was probably pretty easy for you and to explain why we're joined now by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam\nHi Shankar I Know so the first time I'm guessing was conservative and the second one was left or right exactly not hitting\nIs drawing on fairly traditional stereotypes about liberals and conservatives\nConservatives prefer author and rules liberals prefer experiential schools and community theaters now those are stereotypes which means that they're going to be liberals who hate community theaters and conservatives who despise churches but the question that hitting and others are asking is how companies stereotypes are so often accurate\nIf being liberal and conservative is all about our political views how come these labels describe all kinds of other things about us from the kinds of food we prefer to eat to the kinds of poetry we left\nTo where we want to hang out so he's arguing that our political views spring from something deeper than just our beliefs about big government or small government\nPrecisely he's arguing that political preferences at least in part\nCome from a psychological and biological predisposition\nThe most compelling evidence for this comes from studies involved in large numbers of twins some of whom are identical and some of whom are fraternal\nIdentical twins share the same genes fraternal twins share fewer genes identical twins tend not to have more political preferences in common than fraternal twins do even though each twin ... presumably shared the same family and upbringing\nHeight for example turns out to be about eighty percent a heritable when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent or he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology yes and of course that conclusion upset a lot of people\nAnd they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nWhat he and his colleagues are saying is that biology and psychology play a role in our political preferences Noel liberals and conservatives in the United states often accused one another or stupidity or malice but it's hitting on his colleagues I write one reason we might not see the world the same way is because we simply not lie at\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell

Marco and the recovery if this was\nOne of the strongest storms that hit this area and over I think a century chill and so we took it very seriously married Gillum took it very seriously and I'm very proud of the leadership he has shown and will show in the days ahead in rebuilding his community\nIt is a fact vote in the state of Florida any ... any um state I guess which is has to deal with weather events or other kind of natural hazards how somebody buys in a leadership position in the face of those hazards is kind of a taste of leadership but I mean that's kind of the taste of had given the choice of where you can be right\nI think it is I think is a great test because it's it's almost like politics aside this isn't right or left Republican or Democrat this is how does someone\nReally show good judgment good wisdom good character how do they communicate to people in a way I'm In real time that makes sense that helps not only save lives for protect property and protect communities\nThe state of Florida uh we're in a Hispanic churches we're having round tables in the Hispanic community\nListening ah communicating connecting and we think we are the best ticket affordable housing is a huge issue access to health care and a state where two and a half million people don't have a doctor in as their name we have a plan to fix that the other side is not\nA public education which is a huge issue for the Puerto Rican and Hispanic community a mayor Gillum is an outspoken champion of it ah we're running against somebody who doesn't care very much for public education and has not come forward with ideas to invest new dollars in it\nUm and so on a whole host of issues and I think the last thing where I really loved connecting and communicating and serving the Puerto Rican Hispanic community is this is a very entrepreneurial community\nAnd they want a governor and lieutenant governor who believe in growing our economy and in helping small businesses helping homegrown businesses helping entrepreneurs I Am an entrepreneur by background and so whether it's a education and workforce development access to capital this is the ticket that's going to best serve that community\nAnd just on that night I mean the the Florida economy is doing pretty well unemployment is ... this is all happened under a Republican governor and Republican legislature and in the last few years so you might argue and and whether you're a Puerto Rican Vita whether you're a non Puerto Rican voters lists that is doing pretty good so why would they change tack and go for a Democrat\nWell I Would say it's a mixed bag I'm a yes or unemployment level is is low but also true is one out of every two jobs pays less than Fifteen dollars an hour and also true is of the ten most populated states we our last in wages incomes in per capita GDP so what that means if you blend all that together\nIt means there are a lot of people out there working but they're working in poverty and so ... Gillum and I are running to build a more fair economy where more families are experiencing prosperity and the benefits and really able to support themselves\nUm that's why we're talking about housing and health care that's why we're talking about living wages and raising the minimum wage those are all issues are opponent don't want to talk about and don't seem to have a problem with a buffer us those are the people we're we're seeking to serve [noise]\nChristian thank you so much for your time it's a pleasure thank you Matthew will end up businessmen Chris Kang is Democrat Andrew Gillum ... running mate and the rights for the governor's mansion and we reached out to Republican Ron descent as his campaign for evidence to invite his running mate Jeanette New Years for an interview on and to say can do to come we do it right in Florida we balance our budget we work with term limits we\nWe work across the aisle because of that balanced budget amendment\nState representative Mike Miller wants to flip Florida seventh congressional district from blue to red he's running against the incumbent Seventy movie who's finishing up at first it was congresswoman Miller joins us for a conversation about taking what he's learned in Tallahassee to the nation's capital\nFocusing on the economy education and health care that the head when is it they can continue\n\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations Arlene Dahl health dot com slash kids\nLike W.

for joining us are really happy to be here Matthew thank you\nWhat is it that made you want to run for Florida's congressional district seven\nYeah thank you for a first of all thank you for having me again and then also I think that's ... it's the perfect question to ask me because it's what I've been trying to do my whole life and that is you know I I from the time I grew up with my parents told me to try to be a man for others I've always done that and moved here to central Florida twenty five years ago and [noise]\nYou know got involved in little league and started working on the Winter Park housing authority started doing historic preservation stuff in the in the city of what a park and I just always wanting to be a part of the community and give back\nI had the great honor to being elected in the state house for the last two terms and I really learned a lot in that and that's that's what's driving me to run for Congress I learned in the state house I learned that\nWe do it right in Florida we balance our budget we work with term limits we we work across the aisle because of that balanced budget amendment it it it forces everybody to come to the table and make tough decisions because it's our constitutional obligation\nAnd if you notice most of the budgets in Florida get passed overwhelmingly Republican and Democrat because we work together to try to make that\nThe best budget weekend for the folks in Florida\nSo having been in Tallahassee for um a couple of terms is that enough and then you feel like you've you've accomplished enough near ...\nWell I mean listen it is always a challenge to to go through the maze of government but I can tell you from my four years in the Florida House\nThe one of the challenges we have in Florida is all of the federal mandates all of the all the downward pressure from the federal government it's it's the founding fathers ... the state's founded the federal government not the other way around\nAnd I think you know what I'm seeing now is that the federal government has taken over such an overwhelming role in everybody's life\nAnd to run a state government effectively you have a lot of pressure a lot of I I looked at the budget in Florida and I would look at all of these things and say where did they come from well that's a federal mandate we have to provide us we have to provide that now I'm not saying all of them are wrong but it's a it's a disproportionate amount of things are downward pressure\nSo what are some of the things that the federal government should not be exiting pressure on the side of Florida are now\nI think one of them is is that your education I think you know we we we talk about this a lot I Know you talk about a lot on your programs or you know\nThe federal government should not have a role in the state's education system I think we have to be and this is again back to competition amongst the states we we want to provide the best possible education for our students K. through twelve is all the way through the higher education system because\nWe subsidize that with taxpayer money\nWe want these kids to get a good education especially if they stay here and go to college and we wanted to stay here and work and we want to be able to get to get that the reward of investing in these young men and women by having them stay and get good jobs in Florida so I think that's really a ... if you recall it up almost at a closed system a circular system\nUh that could benefit Florida A M and we're doing is we're actually doing very well a ... and the less we have the federal government telling us what to do and how to do it I think it's better\nSo are you saying that there isn't really applies to all the federal department of education\nI think in some rural under the federal department of education I think is there because I you know it's an sadly it's what happens with government all over the world government has a tendency to grow it becomes its own worst enemy\nBut in the department of education I think there's still probably challenges you know we have ... with a you know disabled children with special needs ... with us you know unique populations the those are probably roles at the federal government can help moms that some of the challenges because it it it is a very cost effective I mean very cost heavy and ... a bigger challenge a\nBut it should be very limited should be very very limited\nIt does seem a little counter intuitive a Mike Miller to say um I Believe in less government so therefore I'm Ryan I'm running for\nIt yeah it's an ... but you know but that doesn't\n... as a member of Congress you know we are given a charge to go to Washington and uh you know I I'm so blessed to live in Florida and I'm happy I was not I would like to stay in Florida would go up there and do my job and come home\nUh but I Do think yes I I think I think the the idea to go to Washington and\nGovernment like we talked about it it has a tendency to grow on its own and has a tendency to keep you know it it's got you know we have we have now we have all these agencies and they put out and you don't know if you look at the federal registry every day but it's amazing how many things are put out by agencies which have the effect of law and it's just it's become this\nThis uh this monster if you will so I think my role and going to government is to say let's slow down let's slow down first do no harm to the states and\nThen let's look also look at this spending because year over year spending with twenty trillion dollars in debt we have we have a looming crisis and someday somewhere that there's going to be a call to action to say okay we have to pay start paying off his dad especially if if the interest rates increase in we have\nYou know God Forbid we have another recession or other calamity where where we we have this giant debt hanging over our heads that could be our kids grandkids paying off it shouldn't be that way\nIn the ... gone off the national ... gone up since the the most recent administration was elected bus\nIt it has been going up for since World War two I don't know in the last time we you know I Know we used to enact that to try to get just to save the planet with World War two and then we've and now we've sort of gotten into this operation where we just keep spending and I think what it really just start with the budget in in the state of Florida we balanced the budget we make tough decisions and the federal government", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)",
