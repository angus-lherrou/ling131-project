could potentially exacerbate the the effects of retired what about trying to clean it up all six of is there anything that you've sort of identified that that might help to to fix that it was one time\nAnd so you know it it ... red tide it they are naturally\nOccurring that scientists hypothesized that red tide basically resets the ecosystem you know it seems like it's knows everything but I think a fighter plane community remains that that is hypothesized to beat the cause of the towns that\nI'm getting rid of invasive or exotic species for example so just like wildfires they've kind of need to have their part of the ecosystem but when it got out of control\nThat's when humans intercede the question is harder human intercede before the red tide without causing any long term effects to the ecosystem and so we are looking at different mitigation strategy is to determine what affected but yet what will not cause those long term effect\nOn the show where we're setting options right now we're going to move forward with free or doing laboratory studying that neither of them which is just a small scale test basically and then we'll test to enact canal way on if it's\nAt an auction does prove to be non invasive\nTell 'em I'm looking forward to seeing seeing what we have a store that however you know if there is any any\nImpact or I ... that that is being done\nFrom human impacts

to red tide and that's disconnect singer and courteous services using native species not watering during the rainy season not using fertilizer\nAnd I know some counties are already on board with it by

you see somebody's front yeah they've got a little signs saying I've got a lagoon friendly low and moderate look quieted down an emerald green and\nBillion ... billion both smooth titles smooth as a as a last month the white one but ah that might be better for the lagoon and a ... in the long run\nYeah I mean we don't live in Connecticut and we don't have winters killing the grass and then being grass growing back and we have a different species of grass here so it's just unrealistic to to have that kind of\nImage of what you think you should look like\nWhen I get a call and now we've got a nice calling in from the Everglades a needle what's on your mind thinking about the subject\nOf morning yeah my question was um what else there is red tide having on the Everglades and if it is impacting what are we doing about it\nThat's a great question thanks for your call appreciate that I didn't want to say that one because you're kind of looking into the Everglades is what are you with areas of focus stories you're riding et cetera or tell us what's going on down there\nWell red tide again is is it salt water algae and the Everglades have freshwater um eco system I'm about ... what we are seeing 'em just this week president Donald Trump signed into law I'm\nA water resources um I'm developing an act and this is a large ... a large piece of legislation it authorizes spending on water projects across the country\nAnd one is day one of the projects included in this legislation is a reservoir\nI'm south of Lake Okeechobee for Everglades restoration and when is the one of the things that's ready to fire will help with art does these plans of blue green algae by restoring by bringing back a more historic flow of water south through the Everglades rather than east and west from Lake Okeechobee to\nThese coastal estuaries which are very harmed by these flows freshwater\nUm the source of freshwater impacting wildlife and and the ACA system itself and they also bring with it um blue green algae\nUm which is also damaging to ...\n... ... could bring you back in promoting something that the a piece of legislation son is a little by the president it's it's a lot of money set aside for that reservoir of the state legislature as it was taking some action especially after the blue green algae outbreaks in twenty sixteen\nYou feel like enough is being done at the state level at least to put money into research into litigation if what's what's going on that\nWell yes or no they're not not enough money because it's a huge mail them and we actually got in our heads around that number yet uh and we we certainly are uh it's we're we're happy that the\nCongress I guess I guess the good news is we're getting close to the election so it is interesting to see the amount of attention that this is good enough you know from a from elected officials which which is good and we hope that it continues after the election\nUh all the uh water resources development at the same you said this project has been authorized now\nWe still have appropriations process to go through but all signs are positive that ah that will take place on the on the state level um again we've we've got a few a few issues um most of the attention for a blue green algae impaired waters\nHas been associated with springs it's very similar problem lots of septic tanks lots of nutrients in the system and so the legislature and governor have or\nHer focus dollars on a springs rush corrosion\nA not so much with us George ah we have not had dedicated sources of for a stream or restoration efforts\nThere have been a few bills are that have been put in the legislature last few years but they have not been successful or the legislature has earmarked\nDollars for a Everglades restoration of springs and ... and actually a few million dollars for like a popular but have not yet I'm taking a step toward the the surgery a stream a legislation we hope that\nIt's fantastic um they say that uh uh there's just a couple of things that people will stop in and look at one of them as a Zamboni driving a in circles around the ice so uh it's fine it's it's nice to be part of the crowd part of the gain environment and and just know that you're contributing to a a incredible sport\nWhich takes about Fifteen minutes what are you thinking about while you're out there was a sort of been like in the midst of all the hubbub after the state to stop coughing up you know as\nIt is but you're actually multitasking quite a bit you've got not only the blade is that your adjusting as you go across the ice surfaces\nYou're controlling your water to not only one water tank but to you've got a wash water tank that helped clean the ice and helped create that's washed that you're picking up with the with the blade you have a second water source which is your hot water source that you're putting down behind you\nAnd then in addition to that you're staring in very tight quarters so between the blade the water or and and the steering itself\nI got a lot going on so we try and smile at the crowd and wave as much as we can but at the same time uh uh we're doing a lot of work in that short window\nAnd the different kinds of us unique for different things that you just a couple of figure skaters practicing out here at the moment\nWhat kind of lost to they need now does that does a from a hockey game\nYet though the figure skaters they definitely like a a softer ice in general than than hockey players a weekend of the nice part about ice than most people don't really know about as we can adjust that temperature\nOr we can kick that temperature down in the range of Seventeen and Nineteen degrees and make that hard fast ice hockey players love we can kick that temperature up to twenty five twenty six degrees to a little bit of a softer ice surface that figure skaters like for their edges for their spin\nFor for their jobs so the ice surface is deployable surface can be very dynamic in that sense\nDo you have to just kind of get out there and practice of it yourself or there's no one else around like it just gets on and\nI Do the the Iranians now that I'm a a rink owner I I'd probably skate less than I ever have in my life but uh but when I Do I'm a member of the Orlando curling club so I Try and curl whenever I can we've had two big tournaments out here in the last year I play regularly and our men's league so I Try and get out at least once a week for that\nAnd again back to the coaching and the wrapping I just really enjoy being around the uh the youth aspect of the games and as an official\nOr I Do want to show me the design boating let's take a look\nTo them bunny suits and a grudge just off the ring\nThat is it yes it was quite a bit bigger than what I mean yes it's a it's about the size of a large\nAh you know SUV a a a larger S. U. S. U. V. but it's a very heavy machine\nUm it's ... it holds a lot of water and it's got a unique apparatus on the back which is called the condition or in the condition or really does most of the work this is the genius of of this a machine that Frank Zamboni invented\nHe owned a uh ice making plant in ... California of all the places you would think where that money would be invented would be in California but it it was there and he needed a machine that would allow him to get more people on the ice and not have to\nWorry about a an entire crew of of time taking to uh prepare\nThat ice so inside this condition or our ...\nLarge ... that will collect the snow as the machine drives over the ice\nAn eight foot razor blade very very sharp razor blade sits on the back of that condition or we go through probably about two blades a month\nWe take it out to a U.S a special company that does ah the sharp earnings for us but it's very similar to the rays are in a in a race or that you would use on your face the exact same shape those thin razor blades\nThat condition or using hydraulic pressure drops down onto the ice and the operator can change the pitch of that\nBlade to pull up more or less ice depending on how deep of a cut that they need to do and those ... collect that snow\nPull it up a vertical logger and dump it into this giant a collection area here\nThat holds that snow um and and most drivers if they're doing a a a deep cut will fill that entire tank with with snow you're talking about a rank that two hundred feet long uh eighty five feet wide so that's Seventeen thousand square feet of ice that you're that you're resurfacing\nTill I was not it is a lot of snow and make them great snow piles in Florida\nTo realize that some of them but I mean we get for a spin around the ring you will be broadening the odd one noise [noise]\nWhat do you do have in mind\nWe love making a snowman yeah but we do have they done that in in the\nAnd not allowed to dump the frozen water in\nJustin surreal it was a managing partner at the Daytona ... arena and one of his them\nBunny drivers for the Orlando solar is the next time you're watching a game of hockey think about that that ... nobody flying around the room so I quickly if ... hadn't been to the ice free services multiplied jeep some water tank to John razor blade and a lot of pressure\nDue to come on and destruction we revisit a performance from sing a song Russia honey comes the diseases back in the minute\nHe [noise] he\n[noise]\n\n\nThis was going to let them do what you were Murphy thanks for joining us for intersection coming up later on today we're going to have spotlight march march ...\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of make the point that a W.
