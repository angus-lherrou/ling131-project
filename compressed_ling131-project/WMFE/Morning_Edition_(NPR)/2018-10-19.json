elections in the United states let's take a moment to check on democracy in Afghanistan\nThat country has been planning parliamentary elections this weekend most of the voting will proceed but at a very large populous province the voting has been postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line mark on the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend one of the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning been like\nA health plan was to have a very\nBig nationwide election more than\nTwo thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors uh an philosophies ah there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry partly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true well and partly\nWidespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud and you know you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of the as the as ... but also a great deal of of worry a A N and an anxiety I at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question\nWhat is possibly going to be any different a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously that says at\nA measure taken on an emergency basis um just to to calm things down and I'm the kind of hard to very large province which is to fly off\nIt's the least have its intelligence tastes and its governor has greatly worded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think that's that obviously measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would take and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots and lots of voters but let's let's see what happens tomorrow on let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're going to be taking things one day at a time here\nDoes it feel and the rest of the country Pamela constable like a democratic process does do do you feel like you're in the middle of a reelection campaign where the people's will might be expressed\nI'd do it does ah it's been it's been a a\nA nice experience so to speak out compared to\nPrevious elections here um you know record record numbers of candidates out and about a four hundred women are among the candidates with it which is extraordinary a for a very traditional society like this one up on the other hand candidates although they've been\nIn the an active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've ... they've been cautious\nGay that inside events um it had a loudspeaker trucks but you have not seen a massive public rallies a few have been held in the provinces at some of those have been attacked\nI'm so and and as we mentioned earlier that you had candidates have been killed\nAnd well okay Pamela constable of the Washington Post in Afghanistan and thanks so much\nIt very welcome\nMm\nMusic means of his time restore records morning you were

as Latino students at my school that we're going to be terrified but what what was during them they were worried that their parents were going to be deported\nAnd some of their parents were she told me only making her students more nervous and it definitely has an effect on how they learn\nIn where when when you're living in fear it's really hard to learn about things like cells and body

cross and two of those ah where supporting that shelter workers and and feeding\n'em to those counts um haven't quite stabilized um you know people have been some of some individuals have been kind of sticking it out and hunkering down at home but now it's been you know\nEight nine days it they've been there and and now we see those individuals coming to the shelter um but we also see some people that have been in shelters for several days that are are going home and and trying to get back to some kind of normal face wherever I'm supporting those ah in\nAbout three districts that covering I'm In the main counties that have that the major affected areas and including golf a hand I'm just telling it might not here to get them all correct a bay Washington counties Gulf Franklin Jackson County and liberty in Gadsden county\nAre you expecting I'm Rebecca ... that these shows will be open for mom is it going to be that sort of situation or is there a kind of a fun time do you think the shelters there'll be a need for them\nAs we are where we're at right now we don't have a timeline um we are traditionally shelters are opened and schools\nUm and as the schools are striving to get back to normal their assessing client needs and trying to ... and ... are there are sheltering locations and set up a big joke as a for the past few days and and the Fox and the next few days is trying to determine the ongoing sheltering needs but we do intend that\nWe don't have that final date as that right now is how long these shelters and the up and it is going to be for the foreseeable future\nMhm ... um what about the sort of a little outlook for speaking with food bank I mean how how long do you think you might need to be in the next ... the ... that you were in right now where you're standing up convoys of supplies\nYeah we expected to be uh going on for months Smith who we are as I mentioned are part of the feeding America network and and uh as as the national network of food banks they have a really coordinated way of of sort of marshalling that food wealth from all of the companies that they work with\nA throughout the year for a for food donations and can direct them to the affected areas in a you know you know in a very ... you know quick way and so on and so in central Florida or we're going to be serving as a really important staging point for food that's that's making its way into the state and yeah we'll we'll have to send it back a little bit north\nUh but uh it's important that all of those things don't arrive at once I'm you know in in the affected areas because they can't handle it all at once is a\nIs there a specific kind of thing that you need right now like you you mentioned meals ready to eat a Maori\nYeah absolutely and we have gotten quite a few of those through Feeding America and feeding Florida but what we need right now from the general public or donations of funds and also a of of non perishable food items and cleaning supplies so canned foods are non perishable shelf stable type items that we can box up\nAnd send to the panhandle are are are much needed we can collect those that are that are three sites are here in central Florida in ... and ah you know go on line and figure out how to help whether it's dollars are are giving money mhm or are we giving food rather\nCynically uh Orange County a party or Merkel voter when it brings you back I mean there's a there's a caravan of first responders from central Florida hitting back how they've been deployed for some time now what are you hearing from them\nSo so these are the folks who are really at the point of the spear in fact the the hurricane winds were just fighting when they made their way into the into the a hurricane area so uh they literally were walking in front of their vehicles finding a clear path through the devastated roadway\nUs to get to these folks who had a road out and and survive the storm or they are a pretty heavily impacted\nBy what they've witnessed a I can tell you that each and every one of them wanted to stay in theater or when we were changing them out they wanted to continue the work\nThey were doing um but it was time for us to bring engine slash crews and are they are a tired but a really very humbled and very grateful to have been able to deliver the service that they are that they provided\nSome of them may be going to just take a break for a day or two and then hid backup ... is that the way it might work\n[noise] so uh what we do is we rehabbed them for several days uh they've fiction forward to remember that they have been living in a primitive condition a lot of these folks have slept in their vehicles are slept on the ground beside devastated fire stations um so we're going to let\nThem get back to some normal life they're going to have their first a hot shower in a couple of weeks and uh yeah I I think a lot of them would love to come back and continue the mission\nAnd a Rebecca ... with the American Red Cross um what about the red cross worth is I'm I'm sure some of them must be sort of experience in the same conditions and may be ready for a break would that be right\nYeah so typically are volunteers and staff fallen to chew it kept playing it\nUm we like them to take again some time off um after seven days the cycle everybody out for a day and then they can stay in the Detroit area after after two weeks sometimes three weeks um and then we cycle that out we asked him to take a full week off\nAnd then if they want to come back out we've all come down for an arms that we're constantly getting fresh volunteers and every day so a rotating our teams are shelter teams get rotated out I'm\nMore frequently than every seven days just because it's it's even though they're not working twenty four hour shifts there basically on twenty four hour shifts\nSo he likes to get them breaks as frequently as possible\nAnd is it a food bank that they can have us is involved with a up in that area told me a little bit about that and what the demand is at that feedback\nYeah right now there are two main food banks that we work within that are in the affected areas one is in Tallahassee the uh second harvest of the Big Bend is what it's called and then of course there's feeding the Gulf Coast\nWhich is in Bay county and uh I can tell you that both of them are are just you know it's an all hands on deck situation up there everything that they're doing is on top of their normal\nOr a mother love your son or daughter you know that is the closest thing that we as humans can see you know tangibly asked the white guy about everybody and I was really torn in that I Love God\nBut does that mean that I cannot find a way he is at the same time in two thousand Thirteen I was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer\nAnd within that process because sometimes and going through things we wonder you know we we want to say oh it's what what are people trying to do me what God what are you trying to do me\nA letter people trying to do to me and we don't interest that you know but my thing is that what God what are you trying to teach me you know about the situation\nAnd you know during the process of you know the cancer and I had a lot of time to talk to a guy in to reflect and he allowed me to see that I was on that journey not only for myself but for others\nThat was the main thing and so got spoke to me one day and it was that moment a friend of mine asked me she was like what the pebble moment\nI was I Know that that was a Boulder opposite my kids and and I can hear the guy for a guy so real\nAnd he asked me this simple question why can't you love the way I Love and I was like oh that's\nTo\nLove every batch I pray for everybody I feed the hungry I Do what you said you know everybody\nAnd then he spoke to make any sense why can't you love your son the way that I Love your side\nWhat about the your relationship with the church the enemy has that been tough as well and and I used to with the same church that you were was and I guess mouser you grew up going to\nWell yet that the as far as the relationship with the church I Would say right now
