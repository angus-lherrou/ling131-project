this country we often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can't take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nSemitism is the ideology that Jews are most liberal it out to control the world Jeffrey her story of the University of Maryland says the

philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person gets paid by sorrows or somebody\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her far use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump has personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest way [noise]\nYou know talking about they talk about the early ...\nHer says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are a very small in number but we are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops

getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords ... short term leases that Steve shorts with commercial real estate service Jay allows says that ... appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a lamb or to activate the storefront an activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model to sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone is using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... to regret and we walked in the ... and we've seen a lot of British you know like fingers and

M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nAbout politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity [laughter] how did that take shape sure it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all the families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there is another solution that there's a different solution [noise] so I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and [noise] I understand you\nAlso watched the Supreme Court nomination hearing the Brett Kavanaugh really closely I ... how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault and people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um\nI Believe doctor for it and I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough evidence for for for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers\nI guess I feel I feel more passes because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic checked boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for\nA Republican and not coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I has [laughter] ... you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job\nThen you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism electric room and they get so much for talking with I think you know\nThirteen year old age eight ten and mom says the attack about two miles

scared\nAnd how many of the cell phone or at all and they all raised their hands and that was at\nThe floodgates open and they were all presenting their you know what emotions they were going to and I think they had a hard time processing but I told them that's okay because adults are having a hard time I think\nOne of her eighth grade students that she was concerned that the attack on the synagogue would soon be forgotten\nBecause mass shootings have become a regular part of life\nAnd I didn't know what to say to her sometimes the teacher\nDoesn't know what to say but then I came back

know from studying Holocaust how the doors are shut down on\nI'll be buried Monroe is the head of the school she says well older students process their grief through learning and reflecting about anti Semitism some younger students were scared\nA lot of them were like I go there or my family goes drivers there last week and one child asked about um when I go back and we're going to have to see the bullet holes Doris\nBarren Munro says she directs teachers to listen first and ask questions before giving answers just say what do you know about it and find out where they're coming from usually it's a much stronger place than the adult she says teachers are not only helping students process tragedy there also teaching them that it's their job to make the world a better place\nIn the bridge to put on them which is basically repair of the world so from a very young age we families and the school share and partner in helping kids understand their place in the world their place in history

ever understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her story it at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person I guess I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her fire use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because a logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nHas written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element too says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere this is talk about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews getting nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection he\nWants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that his face and if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys at my school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidents has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence for for for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflakes said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I were to Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers [noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for\nA a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your about your evolution\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go which is hey that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job\nThen you
