Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court prompted a lot of discussion in all corners of American Life about sexual assault and specifically how young men are taught or not taught about consent\nAnd Jewish organization near Philadelphia has a program to talk about this from other difficult topics with teenagers NPR's Jeff Brady sat in with a group of young men\nIn the basement of a suburban Philadelphia home a half dozen high school freshmen boys are munching on chip and practical to thirty five year old group leader Cody greenest introduces the week's\nTopic raise your hand if you heard of the me too movement\nHe's a volunteer with moving traditions which organizes conversations like this with thousands of Jewish teens around the country greenish leads a discussion about historical power differences between men and women and\nHow that can play out when it comes to Chinese do we believe that\nVerbal consent as necessary but\nOne of the voice David Letterman says it isn't always so simple he describes the situation on a bus where both people already said they're interested in each other and that girl purposely sits next to the boys\nAre there and then she puts a blanket around you too and lays down by ... yeah exactly and I cut us enjoy life grabs your hands or you can hold hands and stuff like those are signs you know\nThe boys discuss several different situations and most seemed to conclude that getting verbal consent is the best choice moving traditions founder and CEO Deborah Meier says the goal is to give teens this space to arrive at the right answer with their peers\nWe aren't telling them this is how you need to behave and this is how you don't behave and we don't shame them for who they are we help guys uncover the tenderness and that connection and enjoying themselves as a human being and develop for themselves a sense of ethics and values and responsibility\nTalking about sexual assault consent this way sounds different from what a lot of people heard in the past University of New Hampshire sociology professor Sharon Potter says older generations might remember talks for incoming college freshmen\nWe have ... and ... and ... you know the capital and they went on and on and he made and then we went and got nana how not to be made that\nThe problem says Potter is that only a small percentage of men are perpetrators Potter says a more productive approach is to train bystanders how to identify someone who may be at risk of sexual assault and then how to intervene Pato says this is hard work but not impossible\nWe've already had a with anti drunk driving\nDecades back most people were uncomfortable taking French keys when they're too drunk to drive but after years of research and education programs the rate of alcohol related traffic deaths has been cut in half since the Nineteen eighties\nPotter says for sexual assault this kind of culture change is just getting started but look around and you'll find examples one of the teenage boys meeting in the basement says that as a high school freshmen he's all ready to use these skills\nI have seen some stuff like a football game\nMatthew O'Donnell says he saw another guy touching the girl and trying to get into meant he wasn't sure it was a problem but just in case he made an excuse to separate them\nWhen I saw it happening I was just kind of like oh I have to go to the bathroom in the bathroom as like on the other side of stadium so I said come with me\nThe guy went with him and the potential problem was averted\nSharon Potter the sociologist says that's a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening she says more of that along with praise for people like O'Donnell could lead to the culture change that results in fewer sexual assault in the future\nUh let's see if anything like that occurs NPR's Peter Kenyon thanks Peter ... thanks\nOh\nThe largest oil company any laugh is encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at ExxonMobil had announced that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send them to climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIf it's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on his main products\nMyrtle ... says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing wrong in which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions\nBottles and says the carbon tax his group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurgers and says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultants at Mercury Public affairs but ... says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it or Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg Myrtle sudden acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort\nNPR's John Ydstie on NPR\nNews support for Ninety points on the news comes in the central Florida ... already when I told her I

of the teenage boys meeting in the basement says that as a high school freshmen he's all ready to use the skills\nI have seen some stuff like a football game\nMatthew O'Donnell says he saw another guy touching a girl and trying to get into meant he wasn't sure it was a problem but just in case he made an excuse to separate them\nWhen I saw happening I was just kind of like to go to the bathroom in the bathroom as like on the other side of the stadiums so I said come with\nThe guy went with him and the potential problem was averted\nSharon Potter the sociologist says that's a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening she says more of that along with praise for people like O'Donnell could lead to the culture changed that results in fewer sexual assault in the future\nOh\nThe largest oil company and he lashes encouraging attacks on the dairy products that makes executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars or the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of difference could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change as NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution was supportive group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg bird will send the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later burgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax\nYou may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products verbal sin says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what's the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing wrong in which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon dividends plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to consumers\nBurleson says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but ... says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it are Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg brutal sudden acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort but he says he thinks his group's carbon dividend proposal will become viable sooner than many people expect John Ydstie NPR News Washington\nThis is NPR News\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from
