guy but bomb has always had a keen eye for the things he likes in life\nHe loves to compete and as he got older he became more and more interested in the sport of archery and build this was before all the fascination with the hunger games\nFor a long time he just did it for the fun of it even set up an archery range in his own backyard but he began to realize that he had a pretty darn good eye for arrows and when he discovered that there was an archery division and the senior games well he signed a ride up and the result you might say was archery is version of the shot heard round the world\nHe takes aim steady I smooth release and where did it go\nRight in middle\nTill when they don't make it even though I\nDo things have been pretty quiet for Bob morale lately in one of the oldest sports known to man one of the oldest woman ever to play the sport did something remarkable\nNot only did he win the gold medal at the national senior games but he also set a new world record at the age of eighty five for why aids is pretty good I guess you could call morale a late bloomer he was in his thirties when he tried archery for the first time and he's been hitting the bulls eye ever since\nTo challenge I guess it's it's pretty nice to be able to direct the arrows to worried likes him\nAnd needless to say is a job to do\nIf the challenge he never gets tired of forget about the golf course if you're looking for we're el here's where you'll find them his backyard range\nI should maybe an hour an hour and a half every day and sometimes longer\nThe works to keep his keen concentration a

segment is for every one of us because\nSooner or later unfortunately we're all most likely going to have that experience of having a doctor look at is very earnestly and say I'm Sorry there's just something that's not quite\nRight yeah you know what's coming sooner or later and that's what happened to our next guest as a matter of fact right before we turn sixty five the doctor told him he had prostate cancer and\nWell that led to forty six intensive radiation treatment but interestingly he happens to be an accomplished author considered the greatest storyteller in America today the closest thing that we have to a living breathing Mark Twain type\nAnyway he decided to create what's turned out to be a wonderful warm funny and insightful look into life in a book\nCalled the great northern express a writer's journey home let's say Hi to Howard Frank measure hey how are and how are you\nWell good thank you very much I'm delighted to be or\nWhat oh what an interesting an inspiration for a book tell us a little bit about how that turned out\nWell out on my way to the post office about five years ago expecting as all was that I Would find a check for a million dollars even though I think the last check I found was\nRoyalty statement for about Eighteen dollars is forty five shirts as as you said I discovered a\nNotification for my doctor indicating that my on my prostate blood work was off so I had the forty six radiation treatments and then decided to do something that I\nWanted to do for a long time and that is set out on a one hundred a store one hundred and fifty city um\nBook tour to visit the independent bookstores of America and um promote my new book kind of kind of a Jack Kerouac thing\nYes it was that that's one of my favorite authors fifty\nYears ago I went in a a twenty year old falling apart a Chevy than I nicknamed the loser cruise around two hundred and eighty thousand miles on the hotel or but it held up pretty well and I did\nSpend the rest of that summer and on into the fall crisscrossing the country and and visiting the great independent bookstores\nYou you know I don't take this wrong way because you certainly we would hope no uh we should know bad upon anyone but sometimes when bad things happened to great writers\nIn a weird way we all benefit from that because you have the ability to you know to to share with us You're observations input in an eloquent way lessons that we need to learn in our own lives what did you learn from this trip\nWhile the trip big besides a expanding my my somewhat limited a readership beyond New England by maybe a few thousand\nReaders gave me an opportunity to say about my life as a writer in northern Vermont I live in a little\nRemote northeastern corner of Vermont called the northeast kingdom and most of my books or sat there and as I said in the great northern express\nThe trip gave me an opportunity to reflect a not on on what I loved enough to to die for but what I loved enough to to live for my my life and the kingdom my writing\nReading my family and in that respect it was a a very illuminating on a trip\nThat everybody's always looking for a great read and I'm telling you folks that you have got to look up\nSome of his stories because you've written a dozen books are riding around there that are just like them either love the Associated Press compared to the best of Mark Twain the LA Times said if you combine Hemingway in a row\nThey'd have you I mean nobody says things like that about anybody yet you're sort of like the undiscovered off around there\nWell the the Hemingway and thorough quotas all all was amused me I Love both writers but but I've always wondered what it is in me that I'm a motivated someone to compare me to imagine troubled trunk\nYou answered your own question there I I think\nThat's right most of my books are set right right here in the northeast kingdom and uh I came here fifty years ago\nMediate lay out of college thinking that I Would uh teach in a local high school for a year to save some money and then move on to\nA bigger and better things what I found was a gold mine of stories nobody had ever told before and here I still am telling them I'm fifty years later\nYou know it is not unusual Frank now that I hear you that the UN do shape it would be kindred spirit because he is a three time storyteller or the year in a in electronic journalism and and and really does seem like story telling story tellers the you know that there's kind of a renaissance people or appreciating stories what is it about the power\nOf the story that that is appealing so much to not only individuals but corporations today\nWell I think that they they connect us to a world that might otherwise be slipping away and this electronic era they good stories on connect us to family they connect us to nature you mentioned a Mark Twain and and Hemingway it's impossible to imagine a\nTwain was out of the Mississippi and that natural world or Hemingway without the natural world um fishing and hunting that he\nThat he wrote about I think are good stories often connect us to communities one of the toughest books that I had to ride was\nMy novel a stranger in the kingdom which was about a racist incidents that happened just up the street in my tiny village in northern Vermont it was the kind of thing you might think would happen in Mississippi in the Nineteen thirties but it happened in\nRecent times and in Vermont but again the story was a was a connection to 'em a time and\nPlace and I'm an important way of way of life that needed to be revealed\nTalking with Howard Frank Moser a fantastic author you really need to check out his work and you talked about in this latest book how it was a kind of like summed up what was that you wanted to fight through your prostate cancer treatments to live for now that you're through them what's life like for you is it is a feeling as you hoped it would be\nWell yes I'm I'm I'm
