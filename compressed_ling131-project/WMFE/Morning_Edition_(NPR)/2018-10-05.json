families income\nI own a property in downtown Atlanta a it's a whole house bungalow style where lots of families come and they live like a local\nWhen did you bought a house a few years ago and did you bought with the purpose of a sitting up as a as a short term rental property absolutely so there has been some back and forth with the city council um about how by going to regulate these what is your understanding of the letters like how's the low work for you\nI didn't hear of the the new legislation until the city of Orlando sent me quite a threatening letter recently\nThat said they were going to levy costly fines against me every day until I shut down my air being be they gave me thirty days to comply and said that the new law states they don't want any entire home air being ... in the city limits of Orlando who's a little scary\nUm saver lander DACA flash home share where people can go in and find those rules out so there was direct um messaging if you will from European beak they supported us expanding short term rental rights within our city I'm the only thing that we did it that we started to send out letters\nOn since we started identify the actual average of people that are using various platforms and documenting that on a weekly monthly basis so we can use that for future coating force and so we found out\nForeigners four letters were trying to do it in different phases of people have gotten letters that saved actually what they need to be doing\nAnd how they might need to register if they're going to continue to search for rental authorities is designed so that people don't essentially building by up entire blocks if you will of a presidential use uses and turn them into short term hotels in a residential district so\nIt is designed to prevent that and just say no they haven't been able to do\nThat since Nineteen inches wide so that has been in place for some time and obviously we're we're a tourism destination and there's been restrictions on now with our residential some districts for quite a while\nI guess Jason ... probably the reason you're seeing more people you know renting out pots or anti hubs in some cases now was because there are these sort of new apps like it'd be a ... which allows people to kind of gives people a platform to do that whereas perhaps they might not have kind of thought about that in the past right\nYeah they may not have thought about how they may not moving zoning rules are not the first thing that people think about when they're participating to sharing the economy but you know we did want to provide an avenue that we think it's reasonable that really benefits individual households that are trying to afford\nThe property values and rent that we have in our city so we see that as a positive but when you started takeoff\nOn every block you know if you if you look at some website\nIf there's one or two homes on every block within the land though that kind of exacerbates or or affordable housing crisis was inner city and\nAnd and also had a neighbor compatibility concerns which is something that I take your show has explored pretty frequently so those are things that take put extreme pressures on her housing affordability and that's one of the reasons why we're forcing them for doing\nKind of it's been about four hundred full leaders do I take it to me that there are four hundred and four situations where somebody is renting out an entire house using a ... like it'd be in the\nWorld right now our estimates are somewhat you know because people are multiple platforms that we've discovered that most people that are on a platform are usually on air being being self usually the finger can be about Ninety five percent\nBut right now with our consultants we've identified about Thirteen hundred and thirty six actual individual properties within the city of Orlando\nThat are advertising on different various platforms\nWe've identified the address is for about eight hundred and fifty five of those and since we're doing it since ... we started with a lot of our residential stony districts for a lot of concerns seem to be coming from Fort Worth a neighborhood compatibility perspective so we set up ...\nSupport for Ninety point haven't neither comes from Orlando house\nLeno health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the

were fired because without a cause for Smith\nBoard is in December so we're giving people ample time since July if you will when you put this or this and the fact expand the short term rental writes city that people can come and compliance than at these conform to the requirements of course\nIt's new when and people want to participate in the shrank calling me started giving everyone apple opportunity to connect come why\nAre you saying that happened to the same but to ...\nNo I'm saying that if if you're on this first bachelor folks are first face that we're taking a coach boards they would they would need to you know come into compliance and they probably have some time\nTo get into confined but as soon as you're starting to um getting notices and you're getting your hearing scheduled for ... for\nPeople not only perform a little bit more but they're starting to realize what would actually to happen and what is legal within the city so there's a lot of folks that Enquirer obviously I think in the past couple of weeks to have over two hundred people in choir individually on on what they can and cannot do so were you know hopefully\nDoing a good job of informing them what is actually legal within the city\nYou're listening to it the ... went to the news with talking to the chief planet for the city will lend adjacent to the city time sharing ordinance Jason I Wonder if I could ask you then you know one of the ... to say what does it tell a the property owners they need to do\nWell I don't have it right in front of me but one of the basic things is fighting the war and this and then telling them that they have no some time to get into compliance [noise] um and then also pointing them to the website where we register and have more information\nOn home sharing and\nWhat what is expected of them actually went all the requirements of that is so all those things are contained in a letter and it's kind of self explanatory that they need to come to compliance I think a lot of people unless the city informed them about it if they're doing something illegal there they're going to continue to do that in the sharing economy but\nWe want to actually make them aware of what's happening with our changes in our ordinance and making sure that they have the correct information so they can come in compliance\nIf you did a menu of renting the entire thing out and you got one of the ... what would your options they like would you have to sell the house would you have to move into it yourself if you wanted to keep the rent to get out\nWell one thing that we do allows you allow tennis to participate in the ... with\nWith actual homeowners if you will so it's it's called the hallmark you've pie or owner occupied home shrink ordinance but we do have the option that if you want to put a permanent tennis in there and they could actually ran out forces of a home for ... and it can\nOne thing that we do have this a hallmark and yours is that you have to have a support\nIn an amount of room being leased out too short term renters so for example if you had a three bedroom home you could only run out in one room because it's less than fifty percent of that particular home so we're trying to keep that\nHome if you will on the rental market for our residents and of course\nThose people that are are actually hosting folks are or dealing with the neighborhood compatibility concerns making sure that\nSomebody responsibility is is there for that particular property most of the people that are doing that are going to be actual homeowners themselves we've discovered but at least it provides the opportunity with the property owner's permission to um have tenants actually leased out too short term interest as well\nRight just to be clear you you would need somebody who is not hate short term rented to kind of be the\nHost yeah if they would have to be the host and you know it it helps with people visiting from you know all the different countries that we have from around the world I'm visiting but you know the host can be a guy if you Will Shortz you know what's happening in town or urban\nMain streets are downtown and in various places like that and certainly\nFor land as a central city of central Florida and we are interested in having more people you know come to our downtown enjoy a night clubs or nighttime economy\nOur main streets plays like a bomb parking he's been working with not those are really interesting places that we would like to see more visitors story as we're discovering that people that are actual residents can guide that a little bit better than the people that are visiting to go visit the theme parks and what not\nBut the the way that the likes of Denver all Fort Lauderdale I'm kind of move forward with this issue you mentioned some of the cities which have tackled how to regulate short term rentals um the idea of having a ... raise it under a ... a renter and in one of the properties\nYeah said since the hosts themselves as the best code enforcement of the city can hope for the well there are the people that will\nMake sure there are there with their neighbors every day and the social pressures and making sure that people aren't knocking on the wrong doors in the middle of the night or party late in the evening um they're going to make sure because they are living there that the the guest behave for lack\nOf better term so Denver I hate groups were falling to Denver model and how they're offering a similar type of a whole strategy for residential district in most\nCommercial or makes use some dishes that we have in the city we can consider different commercial ... where you are hard for me over the entire unit\nThose types of areas are a little bit more intense than residential district so you're not disturbing reverse if you know as much because you're expected to\nHave a little bit more um activity in places like downtown Atlanta you know you could potentially have one of those commercial drawn you know is\nIs that something that the city considering maybe changing designing for some areas\nWe don't typically considered chain there's no need for a particular user spots noting the middle of a residential neighborhood but I Will say that a lot of ours zoning districts are mixed use stoning districts that are we we don't have this sort of Russia's districts that we allow for residential\nAnd a lot of our commercial areas and we have this nice nice five we've all one of the first jurisdictions in the United states can do that so we're a little bit more ... misused by rice to allow for zoning district um that allow for presentations of element and that's why you see\nSo there's not that sort of huge surge of about ... democratic voters that people think was going to happen now they're still could be Trump is very unpopular in the Persian community here in Florida especially after his recent remarks saying the death toll was a fraud and also saying that the response to Maria was hugely successful\nBut there are a large group of ah you know people in the printing community who do back Scott you do back Republicans you know it's not you know huge fans of Trump so much\nWhile there could be in a sense of Democrats you know getting some numbers and voters out of bed group of voters yeah I don't think it's going to be a huge surge of a bunch of new voters that people thought\nThe women jello speaking of another Bailey taught writes in Florida of course the gubernatorial race you have Andrew Gillum on the Democratic side than Ron dissent is on the Republican side not too much between those two candidates did you think there is one issue which is really going to be make or break for this race\nI don't think there's going to be one particular issue that's make or break especially since\nYou've seen the same sort of thing with that but just seeing in the Senate race a rescue people seem to have made up their minds a lot of people seem to be made up their minds\nWhile in the Senate race you know both candidates have but you know a long history people know them as sort of be the opposite so and the governor's race or you know Gillum and dissent just weren't really that well known outside of their district or their city like a couple of years ago but at the same time of their their positions are just so vastly different when it comes to their records and their positions that\nThere's really not going to be so much of a a large group of you know independence who's going to be making a difference there people always say it's going to come out the turnout but it really will come out the turnout Gillum has to get out [noise]\nYounger people and African Americans um and dissent is really have to hope that the Trump turn out to that came out and twenty sixteen like you know large numbers and\nYou know more rural counties will come out for him that's pretty much both sides are just trying to you know playing to their base but usually in after primaries both sides trying to you know come to the middle after playing to their bases for the primaries but\nPretty much this year both sides are playing with a basis for the general election to they want to get out their voters and there's there are simply trying to you know after all the other side when it comes to you know getting out of their vote\nSteve limit jelly the politics editor for the windows internal thank you so much for joining us gifts due to come on an intersection former record store ... and ... ... talk
