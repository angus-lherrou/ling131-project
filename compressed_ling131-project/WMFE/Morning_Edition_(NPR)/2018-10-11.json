what the US President do but a uniquely to Saudi Arabia where he was treated\nLiterally like a king and of all the relations he has around the world perhaps only Israel\nIs closure of both to Trump a and a and Jared Kushner and mama been some of the crown prince\nI'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally uh to do anything that would want to damage\nThis relationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at an intern in another country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um UC what he's been saying about the north Korea and\nSupreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on

is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate and others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale in significant it on the same way that we've seen\n'em a sick day increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be
