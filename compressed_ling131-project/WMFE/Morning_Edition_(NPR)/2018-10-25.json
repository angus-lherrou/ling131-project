in Asia were mostly down overnight after a bad day on Wall street yesterday the Dow fell more than six hundred points\nToday Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang saying index and Hong Kong slipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January\nAnd its currency has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nYou've already know I spent thirty percent drop for China stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on [noise]\nI just kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got\nFor Ninety point have the

care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nEconomy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nBut what's interesting here no alley that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to appreciate too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina are these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a compost I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was\nAlready vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers [noise] people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand use agriculture\nOils frustration for our sometime\nAnd co chairs the climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about watching [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references or larger ecosystem of technology [noise] okay\n[noise] I think of it like that [noise] like Jane is like an accounting\nBook everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency of black Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer due endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit it kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let the amendment more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nAnd then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute\nBecause I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt doesn't say Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem from the nest solvable\nWith the clock ticking on climate change and ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nFor NPR News I'm Sam Harnett\nIt starts with a Facebook post after the twenty sixteen election\nI'd like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan if you're interested in

that and\nRight now lawmakers in power get together and draw district lines of forgetting them approved by the governor Mike ... is senior redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center for justice at NYU school of law he says Michigan maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear that their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise in Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten this far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up of for Republicans or Democrats and five independence\nA majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the map but the opposition calls the proposal an expensive way to change the system that already works when delete harbor is a Republican and has worked for for secretary of state she says this whole thing has skewed to help Democrats\nGimmick bypasses are elected official in our democracy and if they want to have the pen they need to win elections\nThe initiative comes at a time when voters are frustrated with politics and government or any porn as president of ethics MRI appalling and research firm\nIt has been something that has been building for years\nHe says that frustration came to a head and twenty sixteen\nPeople were dissatisfied they think that the government or the federal level is really looking out for a members of Congress should their donors and corporations and they're left out in the\nCold polls looking at the redistricting proposal show it's been gaining popularity over the last few weeks but it's a difficult subject to get people excited about Chiquita Hannah of Detroit plans to vote in November and she's leaning in favor of the proposal\nOne reason is because\nWhy should the person that often get to decide like who gets to vote in that area when I have a right to choose in and it just makes me wonder well how much rights do we really have\nEven if the redistricting measure passes that's not the end of the road

on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nBut what's interesting here narrow alleys that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing ... years ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks up ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back the carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes\nBlocks chain the technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR E. D. Sam her net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers [noise] people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand agriculture perfect oils frustration\nWith our ... and co chairs the climate change ... he came to the conferences spread awareness about ... [noise] so what is\n... chain or distributed electric technology really references or larger ecosystem of technology [noise] okay\n[noise] think of it like this like Jane is like an accounting book\nEveryone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage and tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency of black Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer due endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let the amendment more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and started talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking the climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt doesn't say Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something that's how people\nWould the clock ticking on climate change and ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from [noise]\nFrom PR News I'm Sam honey\nIt starts with a Facebook post after the twenty sixteen election\nI'd like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan if you're interested in getting\nThat says well

people's names tape to the bottom so that they can get their chairs and tables back\nI'm hoping to find that coffee maker that can be donate the food and stuff like that and\nRight now lawmakers in power get together and draw district lines of forgetting them approved by the governor Michael ... is senior redistricting counsel at the Brennan Center for justice at NYU school of law he says Michigan maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear that their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise er Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten a far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up of four Republicans four Democrats and five independence a majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the map\nBut the opposition calls the proposal an expensive way to change your system that already works when delete harbor is a Republican and has worked for for secretary of state she says this whole thing is skewed to help Democrats\nA gimmick and bypass are elected official in our democracy and if they want to have the pen they need to win elections\nThe initiative comes at a time

Catholicism she says she's heard this argument before and doesn't think most conservative Christian voters will buy it because of how they view abortion\nThere are certainly a lot of issues that Christians care about when they go to vote by the end of the day we know that there's a human rights atrocity happening inside of our country not atrocity is abortion\nHowever the issues are framed poster Robbie Jones of the public religion research Institute says moving white evangelicals away from the G O P would be an uphill battle\nYeah once you have several generations that are voting eighty percent Republican I'm it's less that they're doing that because of one particular issue and more that it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity that's just inextricably tied to

rhetoric insults lives and encourage metaphysical violence are disgraceful he adds\nYour critics will not be intimidated into silence pretty harsh words\nI'm Ryan last question to you the FBI of course is investigating and what are the immediate next steps do you think\nWell I think first and foremost what this morning has made clear is that there may still be more packages out there um this is not something that has a done deal at this point\nI'm that's in fact something that the FBI warned about yesterday when it came out with the statement about what it knew at that point in time what the FBI is doing is they've collected all of the uh the materials that they have so far all of these suspicious packages\nUm the ones that I had yesterday haven't taken to a lab at Quantico, Virginia

two sets of books\nTom ... the director of finance for the Institute for energy economics and financial analysis and former New York state comptroller ... says the allegations are about Exxon refusing to write down the value of its fossil fuel assets that are still in the ground\nTwo sets of books one internally that they were um keeping so that they understood what reality was\nAt another more nuanced reality if you will for the investment public the allegation really is that the company is not as big as it says it is and it's not worth as much as it says it is\nExxon declined to comment to NPR but released a statement but set in part\nThese baseless allegations or a product of closed door lobbying by special interests political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit

I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S views Saudi Arabia before oil or the fame thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing as an Audi Arabia as we know it when he became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year and signed an agreement with standard way to California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it's clear how oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started a relationship for the U.S was Abdulazeez even town he had forty five sons Steve and all the king's since his death in Nineteen fifty three yeah then one of those times\nThe crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nEither just out of the south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence does the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert had the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen\nWhere the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Orlando", "day": "25"}
