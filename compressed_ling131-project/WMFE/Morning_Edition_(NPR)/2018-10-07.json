do you come from a different school George where you think activity instead of being discouraged should be encouraged\nWell I think that certainly was the case one forty nine years ago I think is more tendency to\nTelling people to get out there and exercise now than it was at that time a there is some of that though people are well I guess there aren't many Ninety eight year olds are still running\nAround and if you keep running you probably will keep running George you know tell me about this race and why you choose to run it because you know most races might have a bit of a hill or two now but you are certainly challenging yourself not just run seven miles but to run up mount Washington why do you do it\n[laughter] I I guess the quick answers because there but um I had problems I had I had damaged the cart late shift when I was in the sixties\nThey had to damage cartridge removed by ... surgery and the surgeon said I could show up to attend cave that no more marathons I'd run them New York marathon that sometime me for that and\nI discovered that I don't like to run down hills [laughter] I I used to run up till\nYou get a good workout with much less age or on your age my running buddy and I we keep running up the local mountain here it's only Twenty one hundred and ... it's a it's a peek\nA but we keep trying to figure out how we get down was out walking or running doubt\nJudge Georgia you're truly amazing I mean ... and this isn't the for you didn't just do this once you've run this race Thirteen times how was your time this year at the age of Ninety compared to last year\nWell this year was about five minutes faster than last year but that she the first time I read that I was sixty nine I did two hours or Fifteen minutes and this year is for our ...\nAnd just a little under five letter show I'm showing up of age but\nUh if you adjust for age ... runner age calculator worlds H graded calculator or I actually\nBe a winner that ratio was from a a a a twenty four year old man from a Italy I beat him by Thirteen seconds if you apply to the age grading correction\nFolks we're we're talking with a Ninety eight year old a George at while or who not only continues to run but obviously you can hear the passion and his voice the power in his voice his enthusiasm for life you know George most people if they would have cartilage problems like you said you had if they were overweight at fifty like you were\nThey they would eventually just give up but you just keep going to tell us what life is like in Ninety eight because a lot of people just can't imagine that it would be worth living to Ninety eight\n[laughter] I enjoy getting out into the into the mountains touchy lower on road up touchy not locally here two and a half dollars up to shop and not a threat than I Do that and he joined the Seventy two though he's aged kids\nSay they age is our son we we've been doing that three times a week for well he's been with me now for four years doing that\nThree times a week Tuesday Thursday and Saturday were out there at eight o'clock going up the ... I just seem to enjoy it just seems like I have to get out there\nMary certainly support me in this when I first started out as my wife of fifty nine years when she died\nA sixty nine years now sixty nine years I suppose there's something to that in that so cautiously laced we want to get out there\nAnd it's not just for you Georgia I mean you can't run by yourself any more without a crowd of media around you you're a celebrity at Ninety eight and with that comes I guess do you feel a responsibility to have a message ... what is it you want us to learn from you\nOr certainly not conscious of letting the the responsibility [noise] I I yeah I I just I just encourage people to do something they don't like running something else that's coming from ... cougars book aerobics\nIn a whole string of exercises rate is ... points system that ah people could do so do something that gets your heart rate up a little at least thirty minutes\nA day or four times a week would be great\nYou know some great wisdom from a Ninety eight year old and bill as you know we've had Dr Kenneth Cooper on this radio program\nWho is George said wrote the book aerobics ... and in that book you also talks about what he calls squaring the curve other people's colic compressed morbidity not only can you continue to live like George ... is today being active in Ninety eight but when your time does come typically\nYou you will avoid this long blankly a decline now are these periods of disease and disability you go very very quickly so you know Georgia's really got it figured out and it's not\nJust the physical feed the mental sharpness that he has he's involved with his son and his grandson in the entire community rallies together to watch this guy do with fame\nYou know it's a great point uh there there was one study after another now the talks about the benefits of exercise and the number one benefit of exercise and nobody can say better than George just dead you don't have to run up a mountain but you have to do you have to keep moving and the number one benefit ah is is cognition is the ability to avoid getting\nA you know some sort of cognitive decline as you get older\nSo the
