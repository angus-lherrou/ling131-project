all round rock climber who's ever lived\nShe not only made climbs thought to be impossible but along the way she smashed stereotypes and she changed the perception of women in her sport\nAnd perhaps the greatest example of that bill was back in Nineteen Ninety three when she made the very first free ascent of the sheer nearly three thousand foot rock face on el ...\nIn Yosemite Valley called the nose\nA and and really for years there was almost a pilgrimage to Yosemite by the best climbers in the world hoping to achieve what was considered to be the ... and not only was she the first to free climb the nose in Nineteen Ninety three\nSomething that took her four days she went back the very next year and did it again in less than twenty four hours and here's where the story really gets compelling\nNo one not a man or a woman was able to repeat her successful climb for\nOver ten years she was that far ahead of everybody else let's say hello and catch up with a legendary Lynne hello Lynn how are ya\nI'm great thank you well you know what we just let her\nDaughter just got as a matter of fact this year marks not only the sixtieth anniversary of the first free or practice that done by one party or when Mary Jo fiction\nBut it was it's also the twenty fifth anniversary if you think about the dates Nineteen Ninety three so a lot of lot of things have changed in the last twenty five years and I'm now fifty seven years old I was\nAbout thirty three when I did the first time and I'm going to go back and free climate again with the young woman and I'm thirty one\nNo way one is that going to happen and less than a month\nThat is excited so you are are obviously working out right now before we talk about it in specific let let's make sure everybody understands including mark and bill what we are talking about when we when we talked about free climbing because you are without question bowl daring ingenious clever strategic but you are not\nYou know being one of the great things about what you do though is you know when we're kids respond Jews were curious we we just want to drink in all this great information and we we get older we go through life in this bunch kind of kind of hard in a little bit but you're the guy that makes us start to think again that gives us back that sense of wonder\nOn air for you man [laughter] uh I'm I'm Glad you feel that way there's nothing more exciting to me than discoveries associated with science and then there's nothing cooler\nSo uh uh you know when you're you want to tell the world so that's why I Do these shows\nAnd I think most people are envious of someone like you build who seemingly kind of has a passion that you've had for your entire life and and somehow that passion has led you on a great adventure career wise\nWhat's your strategy in terms of what you want to do or how you want to do a do you just kind of let life come to you or or do you go out there and make things happen God\nNo no I go out on me I Believe I Believe this is controversial I Believe I'm exercising free will\nOne of the shows is about the nature of consciousness and we talk about free will are quite a bit but I Believe I have a direct my energies to work on television to engage people to stay in this case save the world\nAnd to understand the world's going to be here no matter what we do I want to save the world for me for humans or you Sherman kind\nAnd one of the things build that we think you do too is you shine kind of like the beacon of the next generation of education because through the jak into geniuses book series which is ... is doing great with middle schoolers\nYou you're kind of showing that that that life is not just memorizing facts but it's about lighting that spark of curiosity in people\nOr what we want is for people to understand to grass to embrace the process of science\nAnd the work that's on my mind the last year year and a half is enlightenment\nThomas Jefferson and those guys were a poor part of a movement that historians called the white wherever they used the process of science the reason the ability to reason rather than the phrase everybody loves nowadays is critical thinking we use\nCritical thinking to understand the world to not only\nUnderstand that the world is round that there is electromagnetism that there's gravity\nAnd a core of class and green plants that we depend on what may transpire and make oxygen for us to breathe that's all good\nBut the white guys were also into designing a government based on the same ideas as to say we can we can come up with a system that's real bust\nThat is the citizenry changes as we move across the continent\nThere'll be a system of government that will be suited to that is really a huge idea we're living at a time right now where the ideas of the enlightenment are being set aside\nBut I Believe they will doubts right back very soon because you can't compete economically if you deny science and the process by which we know nature and our place in it so\nWe're talking with Bill Nye the science guy who's got a great show on Netflix that's called the bill Nye\nThe world and bill I'm curious about what you said earlier a you know you're trying to save the world for all of us but in truth aren't you really trying to save the world from us\nI and I think you just alluded to it ah right now it's difficult to separate science and politics these days in a it's very clear that there are there is a divergence of opinion about uh you know what really is happening\nAll let me talk briefly a a a a detail a semantic detail I use of language detail science has always been political we don't want it to be part of some\nOther words where you're going to commit your resources as a government\nInvolves politics where where are you going to spend money on involves people negotiate and we're going to build a a National Center in Texas or Florida or Minnesota or Cleveland\nThat takes negotiation politics but the facts of science we don't want to be arguing over but the thing the only thing you can count on in science like everything else is if things are going to change so we want people to embrace the process\nBut uh we work our way to understanding of the universe and small steps increments did that answer your question sort of\nJust you can't deny climate change everybody got gotta stop and when the young people become voters when young voters outnumber old voters things will get we'll get things done on climate change right away\nWell it's a great point I mean I end up the bottom line is life is about curiosity and life is about opening our minds to to ideas that may be a don't seem quite right at first or maybe they do but it's just\nAll this thing about astronomy every time you find out something else about astronomy it turns out the earth is less and less significant but it's our earth guy got up\nAnd Robert here and we love you too and we love having you

for years and at least that many broken bones later Ruben made his Olympic dream come true\nIt's a great story of an end it there but that was just the beginning he kept training he kept working he kept illusion and now he has his sights set on becoming the oldest winter Olympian ever if he makes the team in Beijing and twenty twenty two he'll be fifty nine years old\nIn the meantime he's written his fifth best selling book it's called the courage to succeed let's get a little shot of that inspiration now from four time winner Olympian Ruben Gonzalez robe and how you doing today\nDoing great how are you all do it\nYou know something told me you were doing great I imagine you find a way to do great each and every day and speaking of doing great your book is doing great you're all over the place now doing motivational talks what's ah what's the ... message what are you telling people\nYou know what I Try to take people's excuses away everybody a let's beer failure fear the unknown hold them back and through my a crazy a Olympic story I Try to give them hope sprinkle a little Dixie that's gone on so they'll face their fears and uh you know charge going forward\nAnd you mentioned crazy Olympic story ... and yeah it's really different because anyone who thinks have you just as a loose competitors missing the point yeah it's a passion of yours but isn't it true that even maybe a bigger passion is the study of six cents and and how to achieve it\nThat's a great point uh you know ever since I was a kid I was intrigued by what make successful people successful we live in the land of opportunity and what are the principles and um and I've been a student success all my life and\nNow I just try to pass the torch a to people or whether I'm sitting across from them over coffee or or in front of a big crowd at a at an event\nSo give us an idea Ruben about why you are done what you've done because longevity in any sport is is unusual longevity and Olympic sports is almost unheard of because\nYou only really get to go for it once every four years and longevity in a sport that they seem so much technical evolution as yours has makes it even more difficult how have you been able to\nTo to put your cell phone to lose in four different Olympics\n[laughter] you know my coaches say that I'm like in like a really old car that doesn't have that many miles on it I've taken a lot of breaks and that's actually work for me it was a plan that way it's just the way it happened\nUh the first two Olympics Calgary ADA Melville a Ninety two I did back to back\nBut then I took a six year break and my coach convince me to get back into the game I started training I made a the Salt Lake city Olympics", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
