also something that the Trump seemed to have done frequently and and we know from our reporting on Trump Inc the gas up they're still doing today which is what it is in their interest to puff up a value of property they'll say oh this is the biggest the best\nThey do so it sounds like the president right but there in dispute with tax authorities around the country right now for example claiming

way\nThis whole week effort as very calculated and orchestrated political hair and he said he knew how it was funded millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nIn fact there is money flying every which way and the Kavanaugh's confirmation battle it comes from advocacy groups that can keep their donors secret the thing that can be traced his TV spending and the Brennan Center for justice at New York university law school has been tracking the Kavanaugh TV ad\nDissenters Douglas Keith said both sides are focusing their ads on three Democratic senators who are up for re election next month's\nJoe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nAnd a little over four million dollars has been running ads and into those states\nThere's two million dollars more being spent in Maine home of undecided Republican Senator Susan Collins and about half a million in Alaska home of another uncommitted Republican Lisa Murkowski Keith said these are not high cost media markets\nEspecially when you're looking at states like North Dakota and Alaska um this is really an incredible amount of spending\nThe Brennan Center

hearing Kavanaugh described the allegation against him this way\nThis whole week effort as very calculated and orchestrated political hair and he said he knew how it was funded millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nIn fact there is money flowing every which way and the Kavanaugh's confirmation battle it comes from advocacy groups that can keep their donors secret the thing that can be traced his TV spending and the Brennan Center for justice at New York university law school has been tracking the Kavanaugh TV ad\nDissenters Douglas Keith said both sides are focusing their ads on three Democratic senators who are up for re election next month\nJoe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nAnd a little over four

and Alaska home of another uncommitted Republican Lisa Murkowski Keith said these are not high cost media markets\nEspecially when you're looking at states like North Dakota and Alaska um this is

Inskeep\nOn to the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nSteve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for another streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kinda bustling in a way though it's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes that have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sure electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states the control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on political councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead there what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said

Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of busy a crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was I was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them I'm wearing ... you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the ... and they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different than the leader of this group which is called the nitric mothers of angels [noise] uh this is a group in Penn on because states which is a sort of\n... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't matter how much you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped

bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things I say to me the most is\nThat there is very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... you know at the at that age\nBut then there are other children who you know they can't roll over on the fence retrieve into that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around [noise]\nIt's an incredibly mixed saying I'm not so much so that you\nActually tell the story of twins a girl who was born with a virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this job little ... minutes of a chore issue was cooled uh she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect to turn off for a boy to act [laughter]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they don't know why it affected one twin and not another that the it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the ...\nYou write that Zeke affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in their
