and be furious and her retelling of what happened to her tracer has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at\nSome of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the inter ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the cats the plus he had you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board

what historically was so threatening about women saying well in part that anger of\nThe founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation\nAnd who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you reference the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's\nAlmost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long when in fact women of color who has been the leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think

borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases that having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand and six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a race\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [laughter]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years\nAlthough we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so is women thing are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around

more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney racing says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact of police stop search decaying harassed black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of

French scientist and Donna Strickland a Canadian both of whom did much of their work at the University of Rochester what does that work\nThey did something called a tripped pulse amplification this is a technique that allows you to take a pulse of laser light and make it more powerful and that was a real problem early on in the development of the laser or you know lasers were developed decades ago but then\nThey sort of got brighter and brighter and then they sold out and this technique really allowed them to grow brighter still and that to help them find many applications\nOkay we're going to talk about the applications in a moment but I Do want to ask how big a deal is it to see strictly to see her name attached to the Nobel Prize in physics well\nThis is only the third Nobel Prize in physics to go to a woman in the past hundred and Fifteen Years while uh the the last one was in Nineteen sixty three and so Donald Strickland was asked about this in the press conference and even she seem a bit surprised by that\nFact you are that the woman ever getting that no prize in physics often not coming from that\nI thought okay I might have been more [laughter]\nBut it is true yeah there is only days you others in Nineteen sixty three in Nineteen oh three and there have been many good female physicists\nWho has been widely held were overlooked does surprise does this suggest a an

Prize winner Arthur Ashe good is his name Bell Labs in New Jersey the place where he did a much of his work um optical tweezers is the phrase in front of my eyes here what an optical tweezers\nThey are actually exactly what they sound like which using lasers which is light tumbled physical things objects wow and that actually works believe it or not light can exert a little bit of pressure and so\nIf you tuned to lasers just right you can manipulate very very small things are really tiny particles when you're ... individual Adams even while and so what are the practical applications of the work of these three people\nWhile the optical tweezers are used in a variety of applications um for moving around small biological molecules proteins DNA things like that and also in physics it's used

city a theater or did you let me ask you that for the ... what is it like being in a land of magic fan\nWell it's it's been a roller coaster\nHonestly I mean it's been fun with the people that we've had come in and um you know we've had some great great players you know ranging from the best shack you know when he was here got to hang out with them a lot so that was a fun time and um then you know we had the whole Dwight Howard Howard era which was\nMajor another big Superman come into town and I got actually the trains white I was a strain of when summer so enjoy getting to know him after he left to land or actually\nBut um it was just you know the atmosphere when we first came when I first got about twenty seven years ago it was just seeing how people reacted to having a new franchise in town with just was amazing you know I've been around that lived in Detroit for a little bit in Atlanta um lives in DC so I've seen those you know franchises and seeing what they did to the city\nIn this being a smaller market than those guys\nIt just you know it was an article and I remember we actually had to own the building called the lander fanatic where\nIt was just a sporting goods store but it it it meant so much to see magic merchandise you know I got season tickets so I'm I'm you know I I get to see 'em up close and personal and it's it's exciting every game you know it's a party almost party atmosphere the dancers everybody you know\nThey believe in it and it's just right now we just hopefully we can get us a solid team you know we've got a new coach coming in hopefully everything comes together where we can actually win basketball games 'cause you know winning trumps everything else you know you can we can have fun having a great time but when it comes down to it and winning trumps everything\nSpeaking of catches their thing for head coaches in recent years since the departure standing against his knee jak born James bright guy was a ... billion dollars Frank

knew him personally has kids worked out at my gym so I really enjoyed him being a town I'm great guy great coach knew what he was doing\nUm I just don't know if you had the right personnel at the time when he was there then you have on Frank Vogel which is a proven coach you know he's a special guys just still\nYou know getting the right mix of talent you know and I mean I\nI don't want to say anything about about him again because I didn't get a chance to know him and meet him out and I met him once in one of them\nYou turn out the general manager manager but it was just a fact of who they got in and make certain ... certain trades didn't make sense to us you know fans you know you're getting rid of one of the best players now ended up being the most improve their last year I'm\nJust getting a little bit older people was one of the probably the low points in recent you know this recent history\nWhat was the rationale behind that how how do they explain that I\nThink those rationale that was great for us he was doing a great he was leading us and he was going to be you know the next we're we're recording them to like a Dwayne wade type this kid and I knew it coming out of college is going to be that way mhm and they just didn't understand what they had I guess and you know I I've joked about it\nIn the past that [noise] that it was almost like we're ... we're like the ... league team where we keep bringing in all these guys and they get so much better than they go off and they do great things they their hall of fame players when they leave Ben Wallace Chauncey Billups those guys who are here at the magic you know and go out and win championships other places\nThat will be frustrating to be the ... team on mice for other teams\nYeah I mean that's and that's what it seemed like I mean like as we we had a good times I mean Shaq and the tickets to the finals um and we weren't able to keep that together and then you know it's late and his group they took us to the finals also so we've had some winning I mean we're probably the second best winning\nFranchise expansion group with the grizzlies or\nYou know you've got the he knows the heat's number one of course they had the ... the\nWell they they were good before that with with Shaq and Dwayne but then they had to the Brian year so their their the winning ... ... um expansion team but\nNow we're pretty good we're we're we're not I mean we're we're vulnerable team no one loves to play us because we beat fill some of the times when we didn't have really great seasons we'd be some of the best means ... is just a matter of being consistent\nSo this new ... states plus the ... what can you tell us about him what are you speaking from\nI mean I Know I've I've looked up ... looked him up a little bit of I don't know as much I Know he he was good ideas and she said one of the defense his mind the coaches in the league and he's he's the father and no nonsense guy gets after it\nI mean his defense where the magic is lacking is that is that what they need to\nI mean it defense helps wins I mean we know that everybody understands a defense is the ultimate thing when you stop other teams but\nIt's still going to come down to chemistry is they're going to come down to the players you know understanding the rebel true roles and embracing them you know and you can work on things on the outside but when you get into games you got to know what you should be doing you know that's where you got a Golden State and you've got these winning teams understand what the roles are\nAnd I don't know if we ever get those guys getting that or if the coaches have gotten our players to believe in and buy into it because they seem to go other places and buy into it I mean Ben Wallace was here doing okay did and it was good player but when he went to Detroit he became this yellow defensive phenomenon you have to physically or the or two or three times in a row\nYou know and then that was a hall of fame players out of a small you know small school he didn't he wasn't a big name players coming out mhm so I think we've got to get", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)",
