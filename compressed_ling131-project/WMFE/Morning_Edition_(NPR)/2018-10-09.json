Democratic ticket for Florida House district forty seven has not been a lot of doors since she launched a campaign and some of these have been seeing is money says that given her a good idea of what's important to voters in his district\nAnd if elected to work with Democrats and Republicans to get things done in the state capital let's even though she's been the target of Republican ... extremely vulgar extremely partisan ... thank you so much for joining us and it's\nGreat to be here Matt I Want to ask you first about a profile piece of the Atlantic was published in the Atlantic a couple of months back the right to know the first thing you did when you decide to run for state house we brought you a concession speech do you still have that speech have you worked at all I Do\nKnow it's it's still here I'm it's actually in Google Drive and yeah crafted that to help me make the decision to run for office because I was so nervous about the potential of not winning as\nAn end is that just because the Democrats in Florida have a lot of history when it comes out I think it was more grounded\nAnd so personal this is for me you know money women who run for office is not grounded in a career move where you can do it again later I mean it's so personal and importance for my community to do this type of work and\nThe idea of of not winning was very hard for me to process and to accept the writing my concession speech was a way to get it all the way it's there and I know what law skills like I happened to that emotion\nNinety percent yeah and the last four to five years\nSo what's the solution there on is ... how would you put more money back into that\nWe need to re prioritize ... you know we actually wrote a recent blog post um titled how Florida is funding and ways that we can make it better\nAnd that was my effort to uh answer questions coming from the district around you know how you pay for things and I think step one is understanding where revenue comes from the state of Florida\nUm there is Alan spending that's taking place that we can explore and by that I mean I'm different tax exemptions that we've had\nIn the books and many have expired but there's no actually valuation or remove all of them from the books and so revisiting um any type of sound spending to see if there's revenue that we're missing in the state that is not going to be too much of a burden to folks but to revisit that and see if it's worth um if those type of exemptions are actually having outcomes we wish to see\nAnd I also do you think that um you look at arts funding as compared to tourism a for profit industry versus the nonprofit sector\nAnd there's such a huge disparity between the two you know two point six million dollars allocated towards arts and culture for a grant program to sports nonprofits versus\nSixty seven million that went towards the tourism industry um my opponent was endorsed by the subject for the hotel ... organization that does not want funding to really be allocated towards nonprofit arts and so you know again for me I Walk the talk on setting a standard on where do we want to prioritize you know these precious tax\nDollars and I think the economic impact of going back towards the arts community is profound\nOne of your endorsements comes from President Obama was that's a big deal for Democrats but do you think that also speaks to Republicans to my particular way I should association voters\nYeah actually I think is I think it does I mean my opponent a used photos of brac Obama and his mail and so I I think you would agree to that to a president ... remains a a strong symbol for many of collaboration of good will\nOf a thoughtfulness and president Barack Obama was the first campaign that I ever worked on and the first person I ever voted for as an Eighteen year old so for me it really is full circle to\nJust come back to one more thing from that article in the Atlantic the or the ... sort of like in the progressive movement now into a new regime to the Tea Party in many ways it's worth a lot of new candidates at the time to power on the ... do you think that's an apt analogy\nIt's really good question Matt I'm you know I personally don't even use terminology like blue wave I'd I don't use that type of language because I think that we need to be really thoughtful and humble about this time in history it's a tough time for a lot of people um I don't like to make light of the political climate\nOf people struggle\nAnd I don't think one party has all the answers when I talk to voters Democrats are disappointed Republicans are disappointed know parts of age and focused I'm also expressed concern\nAnd and it's often grounded in the south ...

intersection on Matthew petty as we tend to want to be the next governor of Florida hit into the last weeks of their campaigns education as one issue to growing a lot of attention in particular how to boost funding for education one of the biggest chunk of the state budget\nFrom the education did this week we're joined by W ELL aren't education reporter Jessica bike run for a closer look at the platforms of gubernatorial candidates run the Sanders and Andrew Gillum\nAndrew Gillum voted Democrat running for governor wants to boost funding for education by about a billion dollars with a lot of money I'm just a goodbye going how's he said he plans to pay for that funding increase\nWell he's talked about paying for it with two different ways one is increasing corporate taxes so he says the richest corporations in Florida would pay more in business taxes and also he's talked about legalizing recreational marijuana and taxing that so raising money from attacks on marijuana as well\nThose are both interesting ideas um or just people might have some thoughts about how he would oppose ideas through first thought he must be working with a pretty\nHeavily Republican legislatures so that could be tricky but the idea of just vitamin of of uh taxing recreational marijuana one step further than what\nIt was actually legal and the side of Florida right now and it gets there was some kind of discussions about how far the\nLegalization of medical marijuana goes in Florida but the idea of raising money from attacks on a recreational marijuana in pine for education that why\nIs that sort of rising some eyebrows in in um educational ...\nYou know I haven't heard a ton of conversation about that and I wonder if it's because people don't really expect that to happen there's been more of a focus on the corporate tax side and just in general I'm obviously Florida is a state with no income tax and a state that\nHas at least in the last two decades prided itself on keeping taxes for businesses low so that Florida can attract businesses to come here\nI mean that is definitely a directly connected to education and a lot of ways because the economic arguments for better schools is so that more students will graduate being prepared to fill jobs in these companies that you know people are trying to attract to Florida\nAnd also if you want to bring a business here you would want to know that your employees could send their kids to high quality schools\nSo economic issues and educational issues are very much intertwined\nUm [noise] and like you mentioned you know\nEither raising corporate taxes or legalizing and taxing marijuana or both would be incredibly difficult to do with a Republican legislature which Andrew Gillum would almost certainly have if he were elected governor he and some of the other people that are pulling for him\nHad said that they're really working to flip some seats in the state Senate and they're hoping to either have a Democratic majority or just have um you know more Democrats in the Senate and if that if those efforts are successful that would certainly help Andrew Gillum\nBut either way he would have to work with a Republican House and you know likely Republicans in leadership positions in both houses so that will be definitely his major challenge for probably any pieces of his agenda if he's elected\nAre you seeing some kind of nuances along the campaign trial as he's asked questions about some of these details like around the education specifically has this policy become a little more detailed as the as the camp I in this world\nYou know I haven't been really following him from one campaign stop to the next to be able to say oh there was a new wants to change\nIn this argument versus this argument but a Andrew Gillum has been talking about education as his primary concern since his primary campaign\nAnd you know obviously he's talked about investing a billion dollars into the public school system he's talked about raising teacher salaries\nTo a minimum and fifty thousand dollars and from what I understand you know he's been consistent on those points and some of the other you know top priorities that he has talked about in terms of education\nThe idea of a fifty thousand dollar by celery that sounds great for teachers but again as there are a lot of detail and what you've heard so far about how he might
