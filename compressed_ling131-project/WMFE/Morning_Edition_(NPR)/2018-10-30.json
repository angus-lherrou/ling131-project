things he stands for he wants the best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes

struggling towards the sense of normalcy as the region rebuilds and reconnect after hurricane Michael\nFish guide tells Ninety point seven cynical Darden crust in what he saw there and what the state of Florida is doing to ease the financial part of that difficult\nRecovery there are huge piles of debris the landscape looks\nLike a shattered and it doesn't look a whole lot different\nThan parts of it or you know initially the streets are cleared up but there's just tons of rubble most businesses are closed and and most buildings are damaged and many are just completely destroyed and many people are forced to live in tents and trailers as local government FEMA struggle to cope\nAnd they're relying on portable toilets and box ready to eat meals provided by FEMA and the red cross\nWhen I met with the mayor and the police chief of the Panama City we met in a tent\nThey're operating the city from a command center path that's how difficult conditions are and the situation is even worse for the most vulnerable what do you mean for instance much of the HUD section eight subsidized housing was wrecked\nAnd this is no longer habitable the buildings are being condemned but there's no place to relocate people who are living in the buildings it's dreadful\nAre they still living in the ... now ... where are they\nThey're in the buildings you know there's damage Druze and other things that make these places uninhabitable but the people are forced to continue to live there because it's better than living in a tent or in a FEMA trailer so what kind of help is coming for them\nWell there's a huge amount of health come into the area I don't want to understate that in a row of effort but still the need is so large that's the point that I'm making\nFor Ninety point at a news comes from

public safety and other infrastructure so necessary uh the state is moving to expand the opportunities arms which are special zones that attract investment\nAnd then I think we have to get serious about mobility vouchers I think the state needs to assist people to leave these disaster areas I mean imagine that your house was destroyed and you're in it and you're trying to rebuild your house while you're in it I mean that doesn't work well we got to\nHelp people to leave some of these disaster areas so that the air it can be properly rebuilt and they can be relocated to other areas where there's economic advantage\nSo let's go to these one by one you mentioned the credit support facility tell me what that is and why it's important\nSure well take Mexico beach the whole places destroyed\nThe local government is not credit worthy at this point in time how they're going to issue bonds but yet they need police and fire in public safety so if we had a public support system at the state level to back them up than they could issue bonds and then repay so that's the idea in the state does that\nIn a way with expressway authorities the Florida department of transportation will backstop bonds issued by the expressway so what do you until there's enough total revenue to repay how about these opportunities downtown and they work sure well there was a new tax provision in the twenty Seventeen tax law that said\nHere opportunities arms in low income areas we want to promote development so if people invest in them than and they have capital gains weather from real estate stocks or anywhere\nAnd they keep that investment for ten years on his own they don't have to pay any capital gains tax so it it enhances the opportunity to have investment and so if we could expand those zones in this coastal area that was impacted by the storm maybe we could bring a lot more private sector investment nickel now\nPlease tell me more about these mobility vouchers and how they could help people to relocate\nWell it would provide people with funds so that they could leave the impacted area and come to places like Orlando or tamper with his jobs and give them some money to be able to rent apartments and pay deposits and do all the things you gotta do to relocate\nAnd so the state provided mobility grants then lots of people might take the opportunity to leave and then
