to restore service in the areas most devastated by hurricane Michael NPR's Camila Domonoske has the story ever since\nHurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle survivors have been trying to get in touch with their families for some it's been a real struggle cell phone signals went down after the storm hit last Wednesday and stayed down for many customers horizon in particular has lingering outages Florida State officials called the company out for lagging behind competitors\nAfter days of complaints new numbers on Wednesday showed just over half the cell towers near Panama City Florida we're functioning there's no doubt run a more positive track Matthew Berry is chief of staff at the Federal Communications commission the agency criticized the slow pace of progress earlier this week\nBut we need to keep the attention on this problem and keep the pressure on because there's still a ways to go when we can't have any backsliding in the next few days\nRestoring cell service is always a problem after a big storm the absence of a signal means people outside the storm's path I left worrying about loved ones they can't reach long residents have trouble contacting local authorities and their insurance companies\nThe FCC says it usually takes a few days to approach full coverage after Hurricane Sandy it took about a week after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico it took six months an extreme situation\nThe problem with hurricane Michael is that several days after the storm the FCC was noticing only marginal progress and the most devastated areas\nWe don't disagree that this is an unacceptable situation\nKrista born is rising market president for wireless in the south she says for rising slow recovery from this storm was uncharacteristic and unprecedented horizons biggest problem is not cell towers but the fiber optic cables that run to those towers\nThe storm passed just happened to go right in a critical area where the fiber with weight and\nIt's just an incredible amount of cuts\nAnd it's not just damage from the initial storm as clean up is under wave rising as having to fix new damaged those fiber optic cables\nYou have thousands of

he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz says a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and said there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nAnd not only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it will be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all because Trump is has tried to make it about him\nA vote for Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nFor me to vote for ... vote for me I don't perceive as they vote for me remember this\nIs a vote for me in our agenda to\nGreat again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\nMichelle pretty happy about that [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one of them\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama whose approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're probably going to combat through at risk of losing their seats were probably rather localized ... more of a local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of voters according to a recent Pew Research center poll say Trump will be a factor in their congressional vote with a greater share saying they will be voting against the president then for him camera Keith NPR News [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR

families for some it's been a real struggle cell phone signals went down after the storm hit last Wednesday and stayed down from many customers\nMemorizing in particular had lingering outages Florida State officials called the company out for lagging behind competitors after days of complaints new numbers on Wednesday showed just over half the cell towers near Panama City Florida we're functioning\nThere's no doubt run a more positive track Matthew Berry is chief of staff at the Federal Communications commission the agency criticized the slow pace of progress earlier this week\nBut we need to keep the attention on this problem and keep the pressure on because there's still a ways to go when we can't have any backsliding and the next few days\nRestoring cell service is always a problem after a big storm the absence of a signal means people outside the storm's path or left worrying about loved ones they can't reach while residents have trouble contacting local authorities and their insurance companies the FCC says it usually takes a few days to approach full coverage\nAfter Hurricane Sandy it took about a week after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico it took six months an extreme situation\nThe problem with hurricane Michael is that several days after the storm the FCC was noticing only marginal progress and the most devastated areas\nWe don't disagree that this is an unacceptable situation\nKrista born is rising market president for wireless in the south she said for rising slow recovery from this storm was uncharacteristic and unprecedented horizons biggest problem is not cell towers but the fiber optic cables that run to those towers\nThe storm passed just happened to go right in a critical area where the fiber with weight and it's just an incredible amount of ...\nAnd it's not just damage from the initial storm as clean up is underway rising as having to fix new damaged those fiber optic cables\nYou have thousands of recovery workers you have to agree remove all happening you have a lot or store work that I could just have an accidental cut in an area that we've already repaired and do we have to circle back to make that second repair\nWill this idea that the United states is more dependent on Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia is on us is ridiculous I'm ... and how important\nWell it's important to remember that if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United states it hurts the Saudi Arabia I'm frankly at this point more than that hurts the United states because we have found ways to become less dependent on Saudi oil than we were in the past and and I would also argue that\nWe need to look at a broader scope of of the train line of arms sales to Saudi Arabia we are selling Saudi Arabia I'm a much more arms today than we were ten years ago or ... and so what I'm suggesting that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to a military relationship that looks much more like it did a a decade ago um there has been a big increase in our military partnership with them over the years I'm suggesting scaling back to where it used to be\nSenator Chris Murphy democratic Connecticut and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee senator I keep\nThe Associated Press asked President Trump this week if she would bear some responsibility if Republicans lose the house in November the president replied no but as NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump may not want the blame is a GOP takes a hit but he still thinks the election is about him\nPresident Trump isn't on the ballot in November but that doesn't mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz says a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and said there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nAnd not only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now at this year it will be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all that because Trump is has tried to make it about him\nA vote for Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nMe to vote for a vote for me I don't vote for ... they vote for me remember this\nIs about me and our agenda to\nGreat again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\nShort pretty happy about that [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one of\nThe time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama his approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYeah most probably got incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats would probably rather localized election try and make more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of voters according to a recent Pew Research center poll say Trump will be a factor in their congressional vote with at greater share saying they will be voting against the president then for him camera Keith NPR News\nYou're listening to NPR News\nSupport for Ninety points on the news comes from ... hosting their annual ... festival Saturday October
