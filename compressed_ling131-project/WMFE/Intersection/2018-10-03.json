{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WMFE", "content": "Well thank you the book is built around a series of I think a hundred to documents relating to the history of the space program and I've written they connect the narrative to put it in a context\nAbsolutely and and it continues through Apollo the space shuttle right up to a twenty sixteen essay about reaching that living on Mars by of all people early on mosque but I I'm afraid today we'll probably just focus on the first\nA faltering steps taken by the United states toward a human space flight if you don't mind that really is nothing like seeing the original documents that that guided and recorded that monumental development have you always enjoyed digging this kind of stuff up\nAbsolutely I think are\nGoing into the archives or seeing other people say again\nThat traces are actually shows you\nWhat was put down on paper after time what people were thinking their interactions the rationales they were offering for their choices all of that is the kind of thing that really motivated me through most of my career I'm a member ph D dissertation\nAre written in the late sixties got publishes a book in Nineteen Seventy called the decision to go to the moon and think of what it was just the the memo that Kennedy\nHad written which is in this penguin book also asking his advisors to find him a space program which promises dramatic result which would be good when I heard forever\nAbout the series of articles in the end the long gone call your magazine I seen the great ... le bon ... illustrations I was hugely inspired as a kid when I saw the Disney films that were kind of based on the series but I'd never read any of the original articles and you've included two of them\nThey make clear that this was even back then it was more about just since\nThen space exploration for its own sake but was being pushed\nWell that's certainly true that the editors of ... years in introducing this series which was a series of articles that ran over a two year period\nHow many of your listeners will remember news magazine I'm old enough to remember at any rate the editors said basically this is key to the survival of the country\nTo futures power on earth will be related to control of space and that's why we have spent so much time in our magazine are intending that sense so much time talking about space\nPresident Eisenhower supported the effort to make up the first us satellite or a civil or non military one but I never knew that he had an ulterior motives until I read some of the materials some of the documents in this book indeed I mean even as early as Nineteen\nFifty five the scientists in the United states scientists love data and so once it became clear you could put\nA device in orbit to gather data they were all for it and they proposed through the international geophysical year to launch a U.S satellite and Soviet Union provided the same sort of initiative that had to get to the White House in order to be approved at that\nTime Eisenhower was being advised that rather than fly you to choose over the Soviet Union to take images or we might be able to fly a satellite and that\nMay or may not have been a violation of national sovereignty were flying airplanes over ... over Soviet airspace clearly was a violation so the idea of a scientific satellite\nBeing launched first in establishing the precedent of over flight\nOr as knocked me you know by and the war but not being a violation of sovereignty when I think a major reason that the Eisenhower administration approved what turned out to be the vanguard program\nSo vendors we all know along came Sputnik one and everybody in the U.S goes crazy but not Eisenhower why not\n[laughter] I don't think everybody went crazy the Congress let alone crazy in the media went a little crazy\nA that's never happened since of course of course ah I I I was in our head on measured\nView of the lack of strategic threat\nFrom the satellite itself he clearly understood that\nThe country they put a satellite in orbit\nCould also law but nuclear weapon over inter continental distances and it was that that bothered him the fact that the Soviet Union have demonstrated that it had a powerful enough rocket to it have a nuclear weapon to attack the United states but he wanted to damp down\nThat perception you know he said doesn't raise my concern one iota where our enemies or across an ocean not on the moon\n... was he in some ways happy to to have Sputnik one flying right over head\nWell he was told that inadvertently the Soviets had done a favor by being first\nAnd not raising the issue of national sovereignty so kind of de facto if they're satellite was going over the United states the United states did not complain\nThat established the precedent that outer space was not subject to national sovereignty and that that uh any country including the United states was fried or by the satellite over\nOther countries territory without their permission either way came under attack a few years later as the Soviet Union realized we were taking a intelligence imagery in in the in in sixty one and sixty to the Soviet Union says hey that that is illegal taking images\nAre from orbit of our military placement\n... and and now we've got lord knows how many little companies are trying to put a constellations of satellites to do exactly this all\nThe world is transparent oh [laughter]\nYeah and more ways than one more great stories from the dawn of the space age are just ahead this is planetary radio where do we\nAre we alone because [noise]\nThese are the questions that the core of our exist [noise] secrets of the universe are\nSupport for Ninety planes at a news comes from

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\n... truly brings out the ... [noise]\nCurrent people from all walks of life to work together to achieve common goals\nTo know the cause they're pleased with this [noise]\nThis is why is the planetary society exist [noise] our mission is to give you the power to advance the science and exploration was years before we sponsoring leaders based technology is\nFire here is mine and advocate for our future and say we are the planetary society [noise]\nI'll come back to planetary radio guy Matt Kaplan space policy historian an expert John Logsdon has returned to talk about his latest book that collects the most important documents of the space age\nEven more great stories are waiting for you in the online version of this week show that planetary dot org slash radio how close to the U.S come to to beat him the Soviets uh into space\nWell Ron Brown and his army rocket team at the army ballistic missile agency in Huntsville, Alabama which is where he ended up he and his associates after World War two had a Jupiter rocket basically intermediate range missile\nThat was capable of launching a satellite in Nineteen fifty six say let's say a year before Sputnik one he asked his chain of command can we do this and was told no\nAnd and it got up to Eisenhower and Eisenhower said no we're not going to deviate from the plan of being a scientific satellite not linked to a military missile certainly not launched by someone with ... background and so the the order went down a do not\nA attempt an orbital launch and in fact I think somebody would come down from Washington to put some additional weight\nOr in in the a payload area of the launch to make sure it didn't happen wow\nYou know what I find it ironic is that a than the first civil attempt fails the von Braun team are working with people like James Van Allen they are successful and they actually do some great science they discovered the Van Allen radiation belt\nIndeed because they had a Geiger counter on the explorer one rocket and explore free it took a while to figure out what the meaning of the data they got but yes they they ah did make a major discovery that we didn't know that radiation belt with their\nAnyone who's read or seen the right stuff knows that the first astronaut the mercury astronauts mercury seven were put through hell and their training and evaluation but I gotta say\nThere's a pretty good case has made for their suffering in this uh there is a main Nineteen sixty document you've you've included that that describes the the the training of these uh astronaut\nWell there's that document which which are by the guy who designed the regime Robert blow off there's also a letter or a from John Glen to one of his ... navy buddies are maybe marine buddy I'm not sure uh James Stockdale", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Intersection", "city": "Orlando", "day": "03"}
