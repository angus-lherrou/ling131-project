five thousand miles per hour that they vaporized\nAnd so the ... neutral mass spectrometer could measure the vapor and they found that only water but they found ammonia\nCarbon dioxide methane and a whole host of organics all the way out through the full range of the instrument\nHow to the hundred atomic mash units up to about the six ... six carbon in a change so just amazing to think there might be organic and the rings then part of the question is there to a ring lead in this during a sitter most rang that had brightened several years earlier so something had hit it\nThrown up a bunch of dust and that dust looked very bright and so we wonder was there some kind of interaction with material from whatever that impact or watch and perhaps we're seeing some of it\nAnd just by looking at the various instruments we started had the pieces of the puzzle\nAnd we still are trying to fit those pieces together to come out with a picture of what's happening in this very interesting region where we've no one had flown before a what's going on in this gap between the rings of Saturn\nChief part of what you said a moment ago is that you detected organics\nUp to the limit of this spectrometer and of course we're talking about an instrument that was why put together design twenty five years ago maybe or maybe locked down twenty five years ago\nIf you had let's see the kinds of spectrometer that is a soon going to be headed to Europa Europa Clipper what'd you been able to detect even more complex that is heavier organics\nThat that's very possible ... because perhaps what we're seeing this organic population are just fragments of bigger molecules that perhaps broke apart\nAnd since she was really designed to look at the upper atmosphere of titan primarily and then once we found the plume on and sell it as\nHe was re purpose both it and it costs me ... looked at the particles in the paper and the plume and now here's the chance to look at material and this gap so it's possible it it really intriguing up you've got the word yeah great to go back and find out\nThat Linda spilger project scientist for the Cassini ... mission to Saturn more is just a minute away

Matt Kaplan I was so happy to welcome Linda stroke or back to our show Linder has been project scientist for the Cassini ... mission for eight years and was deputy project scientist for Thirteen Years before that\nWe're talking about new science from this attorney and system that was revealed just days ago there was a nice bonus and the online edition of this week's show Linda reviews tend over arching achievements by Cassini the span its entire twenty your journey\nYou'll find it at planetary dot org slash radio there\nIs some kind of electrical connection between the planet and the rings\nIt looks like yes there's a current flowing between the inner edge of the Deering and Saturn's atmosphere\nAnd how this exactly is happening that still a work in progress but that current was definitely detected by the magnetometer on Cassini and it it might play with the spiraling particles on the field lines as well\nSo it's an interesting story and it's still evolving\nThere's an awful lot going on in that space a [laughter] inside those rings you found what sure sounds like a Van Allen belt but one that's really close to the planet\nRight of radiation belt in that region in that gap region and that radiation belt has some connection to to some of the the ring lips and the Deering we'd seen hints of radiation belt\nFrom a distance that sat in orbit insertion\nBut to fly through it multiple times and directly measure it was tremendously exciting it it's a very weak belt Saturn's rings are very good at shielding out\nThe radiation it's not like an environment like Jupiter ah those rays are really sort of radiation free zone or when you get into the gap than that you have this rate tiny radiation belt that's back again\nWhen I saw that the ... of Saturn's magnetic field has now been measured too extraordinary degree of accuracy the first thing I thought was a haw are\nWe close to an stream that great mystery of how fast is this planet spinning\nTurns out that the magnetic field actors and the rotation axis of Saturn are almost perfectly aligned I think it's something like point oh nine degrees is this is the difference and it's so small that we really can't use the offset in the magnetic field to get to the internal rotation rate for Saturn\nIf you look at Jupiter it very successful and using the magnetic field office that to get a measurement of its interior rotation rate for instance but\nThe story isn't over yet there are hints that there are ways in Saturn's rings that are created by the way\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nScientists are looking at this we saw the ways from a series of stellar all quotations over the course of the mission and southern rotation right mind actually come from these waves in the ... as a ring scientist I think that would be quite\nThat that is great and when you see the planet is also late and it's it's almost as if somebody had struck a bell\nRight and it's by writing it different different modes different frequencies creating these waves that the sun does the same kind of thing do\nYou expect more news or soon about a rotation rate\nA group of scientists are working right now to pinpoint and look at the waves taken together to see if they can come up with a number for the internal rotation right 'cause you press I remember we used to stand on killing metric radiation and we thought from Voyager we thought that provided the rotation rate for Saturn\nBut once Cassini got there that rotation or it was so different we knew that the source of the S. K. R. wasn't the insider Saturn instead it appears to be coming from the eurozone and that's another one of the papers we actually flew through this s K our region because\nThese are bits were in so close to Saturn and it does indeed appear that they're coming from the rural regions and we knew that previously because he had a different as ... rate in the northern hemisphere already\nHas a A R is its Saturn killing metric radiation I think of radio waves that are coming out of from Saturn\nAnd it was I guess that last of the six papers is about the Aurora because you flew over both polls that\nRepeatedly ... flew through those field lines that connect the rural region and flew through them with Cassini and before we'd been too far away are orbits are really too big to actually directly sample this region or at least not very often do that\nUsually shot in the dark I didn't occur to me until just now but the Juno spacecraft to Jupiter is also of course flying over the north and south poles of that planet and I'll bet you are looking at their data to probably talking to people on that team how does it that the two planets compare\nYes there is we're going on ... comparing Juno data to Cassini data\nAnd naturally just now getting started and we're finding\nSimilarities and also some very astonishing difference as\nA there are some more papers that will be coming out in a few months in science one about the gravity field or Saturn and and the wind to Saturn and those are turning out to be quite different\nFrom what Juno is seeing at Jupiter and then there's another paper in more detail about the rings are really high resolution data sets we got of the rings and then the views and those tiny ring moon so there's more to come\nAs we've been saying not just last year when the mission ended but but I think all through these conversations we've had over many years the science is full of science who's not gonna stop\nNo not at all ... all of the data are now and the planetary data system and available for a researchers Cassini scientists and researchers that universities throughout the world to take a look and help us figure out just what's going on in the Saturn system\nDo you have an idea of how many people worked on Cassini over the years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Intersection", "city": "Orlando", "day": "17"}
