I think lives are when I first met you you were like probably the geek you are like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data and numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter]\nAbsolutely I think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in Beijing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of made the point that a W MSG it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising called a five hour drive and how we do it now with the family\nDoes your support interrupted programming donating a dollar a day the W.
