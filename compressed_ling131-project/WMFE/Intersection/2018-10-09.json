motivating for teachers and other people who care a lot about public education\nInterestingly about Nineteen counties which is more than a quarter of the counties in Florida has a referendum on the ballot either they had wanted during the primary or they have one\nFor the general or for a special election that would either raise sales taxes or property taxes\nIn order to bring in more money for public education and so I think in either way you could have people who\nAre very much motivated based on wanting to keep taxes low who would go to the polls so they can vote against that and you have people who are very motivated to increase funding for public schools and we'd go to the polls to vote for that\nAnd so I think that that additional question on the ballot that has to do with education just gets people who care about education and other reason to vote\nJust a good bike when his W ELL are in education reporter we've been talking about the education platforms for by Andrew Gillum a

is there to provide comfort for somebody who's providing like typical testimony or it's a tricky trial or something\nCorrect and um you know particularly when children have to give testimony it's very comforting for them to have they've built a relationship with his dog while they were preparing to testify and then they the dog gets to be there with them in court\nIs it every county where the courts will have these ... are just some kind of these\nYou know it's just some ... and ... they have to have a court officer or someone associated with law enforcement here will be responsible for the dog and so it's getting more widespread but it's not everywhere\nWill uh Melissa ... bring you into this conversation so how does the student become involved and volunteer puppy rising\nSo UCF is one of those I think believe twenty colleges that has a college club where we partner with see see eye to raise and train these service dogs I'm the treasurer of stuff that UCF which has men also it's been able or it's been really great to be able to like\nSee how much we can do and four seats yeah and how much of an impact we can cause and how much awareness we can raise even among college students who often don't really\nKnow much about service I advocate or a service dog awareness and like how to handle yourself around them even if like you're like oh my God it's a puppy I get that but you can't do it to someone that has a service dog so it's been really nice to be able to do that kind of stuff\nSo when you get a puppy ... to try and do you have a guidebook here's this kind of things you need to teach them how to do or is that somebody else who takes care of that\nNow so we're actually really really liking airline do to have the southeast region really close by they offer puppy classes on Tuesday for ... to age last Tuesday and Thursday classes that were able to go and meet with our puppy program manager who kinda guides us along\nAnd gives us tips in pointers and citizens on how to teach our dogs the commands that were given to teach them because we do get a command book\nA or a puppy razor manual that tells us you know the man's you need to teach\nSupport for

com slash kids\nWill time teaching drop can you give me any suggestions like what should I Do mhm so they're really helpful with that\nHow long do you get to keep the dog for\nSo I have talked for a bit longer than usual I haven't for about twenty months but this time of sixteen to Eighteen months\nMust be kinda tough having a a puppy rising the puppy for that long and then building the puppy farewell\nThe concept of like giving a dog back is hard but it's going to a graduation and seeing those graduate pairs makes it so worth it every time I'm like oh my God I'm going to have to give ... break my heart\nI just think like the song is going to go to someone who needs him so much more than I Do it just like that little bit of reassurance where I'm like he's going to go to a great home she I take such good care of the dogs but he will not go to a place where it wouldn't be the best for him and they won't ... they won't match you with someone who isn't the perfect match for him so it's not just the business of\nMatching dogs just a match dogs it's matching the right dog with the right person getting incredible matches\nGene how long have you been volunteer puppy rising for twenty two years wow how many puppies if he's seeing through your doors and\nAllow I'm On the number twenty right now is number twenty\nAnd do you keep in touch with the owners of all the the graduates\nWe do it's it is absolutely up to the graduate whether they would like to keep in touch with their puppy race or not um most of them do um I have it's it's like I have an extended family wherever the dogs have ended up and then I've been doing this long enough that um some of the dogs that I raised and were placed have retired\nAnd I am still friends with people who had them\nTwenty years is is quite some time to be involved in a program like this and I wonder if you took a little bit about how the attitude towards shows animals has changed in that time\nWell I mean everybody knows what's happening now with the fake service dogs and that kind of thing um I I think\n... people have always been really accepting of and assistance dog with someone with a disability we've also been very fortunate particularly here in the Orlando area where businesses welcome us as we train these puppies because we can't\nYou can't have a service dog out there going into grocery stores if they didn't get to go as they were a puppy to go and experience that and and learn how to be socially so we've been really fortunate and we don't really\nWe don't really tend to have too many issues here um I think people's awareness has gotten more what I Love best if anything is I'll be going somewhere and I'll and I'll hear some child tell the parent oh that's a service dog you can't touch that dog so children are being educated in earlier and earlier age and I think that's been real helpful\nBack to the notion of fake service dogs are we what do you think about that whole thing\nWell obviously it's for anything whether it's assistance dogs or anything else I don't particularly think the idea of somebody trying to skirt the law are going around things as you know particularly respectful\nUm there are people who need assistance dogs and cannot function very well without them and I think it's very disrespectful to them to have people trying to take their pets out as if it were and assistance dog if you don't need the dog leaves the dog at home\nThere are for example the airlines are are cracking down a little bit on this and all the places where where people might be trying to bring the pitch in and say this is a service dog when it's actually not you happy to see that that some of these organizations are kind of putting a few more restrictions on it\nI'm always happy when people educate themselves more about what types of you know assistance dogs are out there what kinds of questions they can ask and that kind of thing I just think it brings more awareness and makes accessibility easier for our clients which is really the bottom line [noise]\nMultiple what's it like raising a puppy and being a fulltime student\nI mean it's a handful at times but\nThere
