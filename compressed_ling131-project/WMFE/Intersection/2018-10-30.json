gambling uses to catch ritual monsters and the real world using this month fun the idea of using all mentored reality is due to ever into the world and now Orlando residents can experience it for themselves at a new exhibit called city unseen it snapple land on colonial Dr\nUsing an attitude on national ... works at the end of flows off the wall us can walk through an office Judea and bureaus come alive Patrick ... is the founder of snap\nWe have a work with international artists who are already a are savvy and who have already done installations in different places so one of the artist whose insulation will have in front of the Dr Phillips on the alone\nIs in Miami Arthur's who did the first AR installation at the museum in Miami or during art Basel last year so this is really pretty prestigious um another one and I'm going to show us or some of her um installations she's from LA and she's currently probably one of the top ... are\nArtists are in in in the in the news ah everybody's talking about her and so she's she has a couple of installations and then the third one is the San Francisco artists who um is very a very prominent in the digital fields\nAnd we have done a a projection mapping with him or a month ago\nThat I say you so and uh we are actually re up a\n... reporting this protection mapping into the A R app so that people can see it again if they missed it\nBut it's a well back and see if we could Patrick how what exactly is I are us that was an incorporated into us\nI think this is a relatively new concept they are has been around for a long time a has been used for a many different industries a lot of uh [noise] let's say designers and a furniture or places\nOr use a are in order to place furniture in homes for people can see oh I'd like to see the so for like this and this place um\nMost of the public would know AR through two ways one of them is I'm ... and then the other one is not a wish snapshots everybody's using the A R a filters in order to have the bunny ears are all kinds of\nYou know ah things that you can wear but what is important to know as as you head moves the mentor layer moves along with that so that that's what a are is a are is that layer of digital medium that is incorporated into your reality\nSo how are we doing this with heart there's two ways we're going to do it one is we're going to have art appear where there's\nNothing in front of you and all of a sudden you can have a a a sculpture or piece of art up here right in front of you and the other the other way we are incorporating it\nIs for instance having your own that doesn't exist that people can enjoy a piece of art that people can see on the wall but it has an oak lamented reality layer that you can see where you are\nSo essentially you got to download an app onto your find to appreciate this\nCorrect so the the office called city unseen or it's easily recognizable because we decided to actually make the logo our snapped logo which was recognizable with the orange so as soon as you see that's not pro go you can download that now a\n... is pretty heavy uh you have to have wife find order to download it because above a hundred and fifty megabytes you have to have ... hours is nearly eight hundred megabytes [noise]\nSo um we recommend and we doing us a lot of social media around this or that everybody downloads pre download the app before coming to our events so that they don't have to have the hurdle of trying to downloaded when there's no why fire on\nHow do you feel about having people like need to use the fire and to appreciate that does that kind of go against the grain of of the essence of out or is it is it OK absolutely\nA that is you know we have a two a birds on our shoulder and one is the part of the ones that this is so great and the other one is saying this is so dumb and um and I had this echo and I'm I'm working with it because what I Do know is\nThat this is only your number one this is a multi you're I'm a project and we know that this was one point zero that this is a a time when it's kind of cumbersome but a lot of the younger generation already used to it\nI think the older generation is going to kind of like look at this and saying this is kind of gimmicky ... thought\nThat being said everything is going into a mentor reality right now this is going to be a new layer in our world altogether so as an art organization we want to be kind of like up front and start up pushing this out because then too\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of made the point
