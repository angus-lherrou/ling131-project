{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WMFE", "content": "And the challenge is how do you polish this off access structure to the precision unique for an optical instrument when normally we polish optics by rotating them and using their natural symmetry so we had on learn a lot of things and learn a lot of new things um but as I say we think we have a handle on that now and we're on our second mirror\nThat it's just a very short period of time away from eating all of its affects\nHow long does it take from the time you pour the glass in that spinning up and to the time you have a a finished mirror or actually I guess because you are now getting better at it how long do you think it will take you start to finish\nFor them years to come right it it takes about four to five years but ... you made a very interesting statements that kind of reflects a bit of history don't actually poor little glass into the mold which is how it used to be done right for the ... where\nThey would melt the glass in a big furnace laid it out and they had these people in these you know flash suits inflamed protectors\nPushing this ... this late all the molten glass over to pour it in the mold and then go get another one\nUm it turns out that has its limitations and you couldn't make and ate meat or me or that way so we put the glass in the mold while there's still room temperature and melted into placed team breakthrough misstated because there is a great image on the website which we willing to from\nThis week's show paycheck planetary dot org slash radio which has like three guys on the platform and they're looking down at all these beautiful chunks of optical glass yes ... is it twenty tons of glass\nHandmade in Japan in small batches in these clay pots and then broken up inspected and then loaded in roughly five pound pieces into the ... and that takes a couple of days so they go back to your bigger question how long does it take it takes about four or five years because the first step of\nOf building the mold takes the better part of a year\nMelting the glass doesn't take long but it needs about five months to a Neal has to cool slowly so you don't build strange into the glass\nThen there's a fair amount of handling and cleaning and inspection preparing the back surface which has to be very smooth to relieve stress is attaching a bunch of hardware that takes another year\nAnd then when you're ready to start working on the near side the front part that really matters that takes about two years there's about six or eight months of grinding the rough shape measuring and then the actual polishing figuring in that policy and figuring takes about Eighteen months\nAnd mostly because as you get closer and closer you spend time thinking more about where to rub on the glass because there's and the founder of the ... say professor ride drained all it's easy to take glass off we know how to put it back on [laughter] so you go slow and it's like Michelangelo sculpting a piece of marble exactly\nTake us down to ... to the ... desert\nTalk about what's going on there or if you're moving nurse yes we are finally I'm making some real progress on building the observatory is just preparing the infrastructure so in twenty twelve after many years of testing and building on decades of experience Alaskan upon us\nWe level the top of the mountain to produce the platform for the observatory\nWe spent some time doing geotechnical testing where you drill deep core samples you send out for analysis to make sure the rock is solid that we understand its properties\nWe did a little more testing of atmosphere but earlier this year about July we started the excavation both for the telescope itself for the telescope fear the concrete pure that it will sit on and the foundations for the enclosure that would protect the telescope during the day\nAnd this is a pretty difficult work because by taking off the top nine meters of the mountains there's nothing there but solid rock and so you've got to break that rock up\nAnd dig in essence a pit that's about three meters deep with very clean walls and then we need to dig an annual is for the enclosure it's about two to three meters deep and several meters wide so they're making great progress up there\nAnd so my view one of the really nice things is they're not using any explosives dynamite nothing that could put\nFractures into the Rodney could basically you know we can the overall structural integrity of the underlying mountain they're doing it all with hammers pneumatic drills somewhat slow fashion but very delicate and careful but there'll be done by about the end of this year and they only started in July so it's really going along at a great pace\nPatrick McCarthy the giant Magellan telescope project much more on a minute this is planetary radio where did we come from [noise]\nAre we alone because [noise]\nNeither of the questions that the core of Oregon [noise] and then he went to the universe are\nWaiting to be discovered but to find them we have to go into states we have to explore this endeavor Unites States desperation truly brings out the best you know\n... people from all walks of life to work together to achieve a common goal\nTo know that cause they're pleased with this\nThis is why is the planetary society [noise] our mission is to give you\nTo advance the science in there for a for\nProfit based technology wire period wine and advocate for our future is they are the planetary [noise]\nWelcome back to planetary radio I'm Matt Kaplan Patrick McCarthy is giving us a progress report on the giant Magellan telescope the instrument that will have seven gigantic primary mirrors each of which will be eight point four meters or more than twenty seven and a half feet across\nThat makes each me we're more than fifty percent bigger than the old hale telescopes single mirror\nPow um are you hearing excerpts of my conversation with pat the entire conversation including more about the great telescope and the science it will do are on this week's episode ... planetary dot org slash radio\nAnd that's not all my advice you to join me on a tour of the GMT facility that is also part of the podcast version\nYou've been down there having to yes I've been there too I was almost twice as high at the alma radio tells you have\nFor Ninety point haven't neither comes from Eileen how\nWell they know how network a pediatrician that committed to helping tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being somebody they don't have a good thing is all important teenage years later how twenty pediatric location their friendship or the family more information including locations that are laying down health dot com slash kids [laughter]\nGood [laughter] 'cause you know I don't think as well as I used to and when I don't have oxygen and I really don't think very well at all so when you go to the very high side\nYou have to be prepared for your own personal safety for the safety of the people you're working with and you have to take precautions to make sure that the decision making is really properly done and from what they do all the decision making the hard work as a lower elevation yes and\nSo for optical astronomy though a thousand feet is a good place to be we're above much of the atmosphere but not all of it we can still work very effectively we think it's a great site I've been going there for Thirty years I just loved being there my only complaint is it's a long trip\nYeah beautiful beautiful place on the fire if they didn't give us a little cans of oxygen that we have the head off of every couple of minutes otherwise you were getting pretty slap happy am maybe worse was that the key part of the decision in picking the last ... site and they did\nKnow the main consideration was that we had about forty years of experience because the challenge in picking the good astronomical cycle you know a few things that you want it to be dark so you want it to be free of light pollution\nBut really you want good weather stable weather good Airflow and if you take it if you if you survey say half a dozen sites for three years\nYou'll pick the one site that had three really good years of weather so people have learned that by making site selections on the basis of just a few years of data you tend to pick the statistical outliers so last upon us having forty years of experience we knew the weather patterns are stable\nWe knew the polite pollution was not going to become a problem we knew the steam was outstanding and we had multiple years of data and that\nReally gave us the confidence if we're going to build something to the last fifty years you want to put it in the right place and there's nothing like having forty years of experience to make that decision [noise] how far off\nAre we from a first flight from seeing this beautiful structure right on with a laser beam shooting out of it well\nYou know the um project manager keeps a scheduled there's always risks associated with that but right now we expect that will have the telescope inside the dome and some of the mayor's sitting in a warehouse next to the telescope in twenty twenty four\nWe probably won't have all seven but I'm pretty confident once we have a telescope we have some errors will put some of those ... and the telescope\nSee how it works will have the world's largest telescope at that time I'm sure the astronomers like myself who want to do some science so we're hoping that will do engineering and then scientific first light in that twenty twenty four maybe twenty twenty five timeframe\nTwenty twenty something always sounded like a long way away to me but it's not so long and they now you know this is a late twenty Eighteen so twenty twenty four doesn't seem that far away really\nSo clearly you don't need the whole set of mirrors to start doing science\nThat's right we think you know if we put for mayors and it'll be the largest telescope in the world by a long shot will be able to exercise a the control system align them years to all the basic functions you won't have\nAll the capability for show you won't have all the the sensitivity but when it comes time to doing adaptive optics you really like to have that full nearer rate because the the primary mirror is kind of key off each other and they tune up together so that really will work better but we could do even that with a subset of the mayors [noise] what are the", "show_name": "Intersection", "year": "2018",
