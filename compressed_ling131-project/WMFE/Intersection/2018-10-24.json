Quander the nice scout wholesale not in quarter\nAnd so if you looked at the surface of it it would look like a very different sale a technology but when you look at the back side and the booms that are that are going to be holding the sale\nThe type of material that's used it a little bit different but not dramatically different you can tell they have a common heritage and the reason for that is uh we we all learn from our nano sail the\nTen square meter deployment tests that we flew on at three cubes at least NASA Marshall fully that in twenty ten and\nWe shared a lot of that design detail with your team at the planetary society team and then they started designing the lifestyle and they were doing that we were doing our design of new scout and we have an agreement with the planetary society to share data\nAnd so we were invited and participated in the planetary society by reviews and they participated in hours and so there's been a lot of cross talk as we designed both of these systems I think we both learned from each other\nI have no doubt and it sounds like you'll be following the mission of light sales to uh assuming that it does\nMake its way up into space on the second launch of the Falcon Heavy before too long and probably before a the E. M. one mission that first flight of the space launch system that big rocket a that's going to carry you up into a into space\nLoni sided I'm looking forward to the flight or any flight of a sales going to have my complete attention so absolutely I'm looking forward to it I Wish wish them all the success in the world\nMore from any a scout principal investigator less Johnson is just had my complete conversation with last is in this week's online version have\nPlanetary dot org slash radio dishes planetary radio where did we come from [noise]\nAre we alone because [noise]\nThese are the questions that the core of our secrets of the universe are out there\nWaiting to be discovered but to find them we have to go into space we have two boys [noise] this endeavor Unites States exploration truly brings out the best in us [noise]\nCourage and people from all walks of life\nWork together to achieve common goals [noise]\nYou know the cause their way through this [noise]\nThis is why the planetary society [noise] our mission is to give you the power to advance the science and that was years before we\nSponsor innovative based technology wire curious mind and advocate for our future and said we are the planetary society [noise]\nWelcome back to planetary radio I'm Matt Kaplan we're learning about NEA or near earth asteroids scout\nThe solar sail cube set that will attempt to fly by of an asteroid something that no silver sale has done before last Johnson at the Marshall Space Flight Center is the mission is principal investigator talk more about your your right up\nInto space on on that big SOS so you're with quite a crowd of a a few stats that or a catchy mad ride secondary payload\nThat is correct or Thirteen at last count a six you cube SATs that will be in the upper stage of the ... after the Iranian and sit on its way to the moon those cube SATs will be kicked out one at a time in a in an order that to be established I'm not sure exactly where we are in that order\nAnd uh to keep that to be kicked out to start their operations and it's kind of interesting that the school bus and allergy continues because of the the point at which these like you are deployed or old by the launch vehicle bus stop [noise] and so there'll be different bus stops so that will be a places where the SATs will be deployed and we're one of those stops\nSomething that is not maybe not unique about this team is that a ... this project is a work of two different Nass dissenters yours Marshall Space Flight Center in the one in our neighborhood Jet Propulsion lab how's that working out\nWhat works out really well with the solar sail system Marshall Space Flight Center here in Huntsville is developing the sale precaution system\nAre the people who have had a lot of experience developing deep space space craft or those folks at the Jet Propulsion laboratory and so they are developing a spacecraft and a doctor Julie Christie a roast Jay is the project scientist\nWho is developing and we'll be doing the asteroid on his work the science once we get the target\nOr me and my team responsible for getting her and her camera there so she can do that\nYou you mentioned deployment using booms to do this which is again how light sale or is also deployed its sales described that a little bit better I mean how do you ... for all these big sales\nUnfairly failed is a huge challenge our sales eighty six square meters if if you're like me you don't think in square meters so just imagine a school bus by a school bus we can invent our own unit of measurement called a school bus squares of area but that's how big are they all is and has been in a box that is\nFor Ninety point having means Ken some land out how to do whatever whenever and wherever they know how it's dedicated to providing many athletes act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten or ... and forty thick outpatient parenting more information is actually dying down house dot com\nOr to do that and you've got to have a these big boom are boos are over Twenty one feet long four of them and they coil up on a school and are under incredible uh tensions strain energy on those is really high\nAnd what that means is if you were just to ah cut loose for for deployment it would be like a reverse tape measure retraction\nOr you know when you push a button on your tape measure that that the ... just old right into the to the box well these booms want to deploy and they have a lot of energy and they would opt out really quickly and that would be dangerous because it could could damage the sale they went on for so fast\nSo we have a a geared motor deployment to slow them down\nSo we slowly but surely let them come out of the deployments system with a stepper motor and as these booms a push out there were four of them coming out of the central box\nThe tip of the booms are attached to the corners of the sale which is folded and wrapped on a school so as these booms deploy a the stool slowly been Dale comes off of it and unfolds if if you\nYou mentioned you had a a link maybe to some of our deployment death it a lot easier to to understand when you look at it and hearing me describe it\nYeah and we will as I said well put up a link to that because it is it's a really charming video and it's really fun to watch\nAnd similar to what we did with light sale although it is really cool to watch this thing on ...\nFrom the center a rather than just sort of emerging from the little uh the four little containers that we have on my cell too but I'll tell you can can you imagine watching that video what the most entertaining portion of it was I'll tell you it was the balloons [laughter] ... well you\nKnow you have a problem trying to test these large flexible structures in the earth's gravity well because basically gravity wants to pull it to the ground and it causes friction\nSo when we were doing the deployments we use a little friction table but that wasn't enough and as these long metallic booms go out they want to bow down toward the ground which will basically stopped the deployment so we stopped at a local grocery store and picked up some party balloons\nAnd attached to them uh the helium balloon attached to the tips to give them a little bit of list so that they wouldn't drag during deployment and you're right uh you know it's one of those a low tech solution on a high tech tests\nThat weren't really well it was a great cost effective and it worked it did exactly what we needed\nTo talk about a party I mean actual party balloons [laughter] well we had a party\nBelieve me after this was all finished we celebrated it was it was refreshing after all that work to see a successful deployment that was the most recently of our actual flight sale\nSo it's our only deployment of the flight sale and it has now been re folded and re schooled and ready for integration into the spacecraft\nI'm sure anybody listening to this right now can you hear the passion and enthusiasm that you bring to this and\nSince you said that you are a a a longtime friend of Robert Ford who like you were as you said was not just someone who dealt with the real world and a real science book was a science fiction writer I'll come back to that is this something that you've been passionate about for a long time\nWell it is for me and and in fact it so when it when I look at the roots of my introduction to solar cells that came from a science fiction novel I read in high school", "show_name": "Intersection",
