{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WMFE", "content": "Patty void returned to talk about how test which started its Hans last April is building on Kepler achievement\nTest is designed to look for planets that are orbiting around bright nearby stars typically ten times closer than the stars that kept ... planets around\nAnd tests will observe nearly all of this guy we're hoping to find our near neighbor planetary systems now already the team is beginning to analyze the first data that's coming down to the ground and we're finding exciting planet candidates and\nTeams are falling nose up with telescopes on the ground and we're confident that test is going to find thousands more planets just like Kepler data\nI was among the many reporters waiting to question the media briefing participants hello everyone congratulations to you and your teams or a question probably mostly for a bill Jessee indoor Patty if you could say something about the importance of your partnerships with ground based astronomers\nWho have taken for the data from Kepler and I assume now from tests\nAnd are are making these confirmations of of all these worlds around our portion of the galaxy\nI'd like to answer that one ... they absolutely essential\nTo our discoveries cancer finds the size of these plans but we really want to know or the rocky planets gas plants or something else to the ground based people with their telescopes with the use of the Keck telescope on several other telescopes give us some math\nAnd I had been tremendously helpful and what that means of course is they have to get time on these big tells 'cause they have to make the measurements and it's difficult it's difficult to get that time it's difficult\nTo have the state of the art systems they use and reduce the data and say yes indeed that particular sick and all those tiny is of a plant you do have a math now\nSo the ground based people who've done radio velocity gonna be people who do adaptive optics and so on have made huge how are you jump in terms of understanding of the data that Kepler is brought down\nI I think absolutely nailed that perfectly um without the complimentary data from the ground telescopes there are a lot of questions about what we find but with that ground data we can know that we see plants and we can measure the masses maybe Patty and talked about the follow up programs protests\nSure I'd let say this is Patty it's a very smooth continuum between what we're discovering with the space telescopes such a test and then a large community of ground based follow up that it's going to help us turn those discoveries into something that has a confirmed planet I'd like\nTo add a little bit more to that the Spielberg again one of the things that we talk about the size of planets what Kepler gives us as a ratio the size of the start of the size of the planet is absolutely essential for the irritation and the people who work\nWith radio velocity and spectra to tell us what truly is a sign that star we have a group a very large group of people who do\nAstro seismology in Europe and they use the pulse ... stars to actually tell us the dime or the star was in a couple of percent far far better than any of them is that we have and now we have our European colleagues\nWho have the gay and mission and they can for the first time\nDetermine accurately how far away the stars are again that gives us more information about how big are planets are and whether they're in the habitable zone or not so it's really a big international team that provide the data that we give to the public\nWill close our coverage of the capital or end of mission briefing as we began with Patti Boyd\nThat kept my results are also informing our future mission designs so that we can take the step to\nEven beyond that with much larger glass so I Believe the world's will remember the Kepler telescope for generations to come because Catholic gave us the very best answer to that question that we could have hoped for we live in a galaxy that's teeming with planets and we are ready to take the next step to explore that's planets\nHighlights of the October thirtieth media briefing that mark the end of a nine and a half year Kepler Mission when we return we'll be joined by Jason Davis and ... for their thoughts about the Kepler Mission this is planetary radio\nClip of tape your dryer the director of space policy here at the planetary society and you know that being a space to advocate is important if not critical for the future of exploration well we have something perfect for you based advocacy one on one of the unique\nFree online training tool that teaches you how to be an expert space to advocate for NASA toward more into an role for free in this course you'll do horses dots planetary dot ORG thank you\n[noise] [noise] hello I'm Robert The Carter planetary society board member and now the host of the societies planetary those video newsletter\nThere's a new addition every month we've already gone behind the scenes that shape yells party that news site and visited with the bill Maher we've also up among tops headlines from around the solar system you can sign up at planetary dot org forward slash can act when you do you'll be among the first to see each new show\nI Hope you'll join [noise]\nBoth ... planetary radio I met cap when we started this week show with the October thirtieth national briefing signal the end of the Kepler planet hunting mission\nWithin hours of the briefing I was joined by planetary society senior editor Emily lock Walla and digital editor Jason Davis it's an honor to have to\nCount 'em to editors from the planetary society to talk about this uh this milestone that we reached today was the end of this amazingly successful\nMission Emily it has taken us not quite single had it because of\nCourse there was be good work being done down here on the surface before Kepler it has taken us from a day decades ago when we wonder if there were planets around other stars\nAnd now now we kind of answered that haven't we\nHave any you know it's it's such a striking contrast to think that when I was a kid we didn't know if we were the only solar system out there in the universe and now I Love telling and my public talks I Love telling people to look up at the sky look at every star you can see and imagine the facts\nFor Ninety point having means Ken some land out how to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando healthy dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten or ... and forty thick outpatient parenting more information is that kids are laying down health dot com\nHave multiple planet and so that there is really at a kind of an equivalent number and if you just think Dan of all the varieties of different kinds of planets there has to be out there all\n... of different systems you know that there are\nEarth like worlds out there and it just seems so much more possible that there can be life elsewhere in the universe after that mission like Kepler we still don't know if that's true yeah of course but we're looking\nWe're working on it Jason you just this morning as we speak on October thirtieth published this this great\nFarewell Kepler blog post stepped up planetary dot org which I I definitely recommend to anyone out there you even updated since the announcement was made during the media briefing that we just heard excerpts from what really stands out to you about this mission\nLike Emily says the big discovery and the big results that are there are as many planets out there as stars in our own galaxy but I think also some of the individual contributions that it made the exoplanet science um we've not only found that there are a lot of these worlds but we found that they're very diverse\nAnd you know it's funny how we we kind of look at everything through the lens of our\nOwn solar system so he called things like hot Jupiter isn't super earths and I'm sort of tunes and you're innocent things like that but I'm the facts that this mission finally confirmed for us not only are they are all these exoplanets but some of them\nAre sitting in other stars is habitable zone so that means so liquid water could theoretically exist on their surfaces [noise] and that there are some of them out there that at the same roughly the same mass and sizes or is that happened in in the past just wanting to pass nine years and it's really cool to think about that now we know that\nThere are these very good places to look for life can hopefully and some of the next generation telescopes will be able to look at them a little bit closer\nOf course a lot of us want to find other earth and find places where there could be life in habitable zones but the the other cool thing about Kepler is how many strange world it's revealed places where there is like atmosphere\nMade as vaporized rock and things west with wins that are blowing at practically the speed of sound from one side of the planet to the other because the orbit so close to their stars other worlds that have all different kinds of weird Hayes there's others that has\nRaining drops of metal there's just it's it's bizarre and are so many strange places out there there's lots of fuel for good science fiction story [noise]\nYeah I Wonder what it says about our ability to imagine things that science fiction had all these cool worlds in it and then we found that they basically exist on I mean it's a pretty cool testament to the human capacity for imagination that we figured yeah all these things are probably out there and now we know that a lot of them are\nBut a lot of the things that we found are things that we never imagined like hot Jupiter's in particular just up and did all ideas of planetary system formation we've had to go back to the drawing board multiple times thanks to results from ... imagine just how somebody systems could have formed\nAnd then those things that I'm as Arthur at engine said that we can't imagine until we find them they were not capable of imagining them bad happens over and over but\nIt is kind of um a selection pressure for older people leading these are what are supposed to be these on new and riskier kinds of missions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Intersection", "city":
