and as we're we're left early in the morning as we're going along\nA finally my wife says hey why don't you go ahead and will roll up the windows and put on the air conditioning and I said no no no we can't do that because we're going to get better gas mileage if we leave the windows down\nOh and you know wife said trail moon's face\nThat real similar to that [laughter] she said well remember those guys you listen to and when we upped our pledge anew read that book witness it yeah yeah and she says well in there it said\nThat the new vehicles now are are more aerodynamic and ... you can leave the windows up and the Iran and your gas mileage is better and I said yeah but\nThis is a truck and they're different she said no no no that's not what it said it's it's new and leave 'em up so I Need you to settle this force ... who's right\nIs there anything in it for us [laughter]\nThe answer to the for that Fifteen minutes\n[laughter] well actually\nThis is an answer this is one of the few one of the few answers or comments that we have made which is actually based on scientific evidence oh yeah right\n[laughter] as long as you look\nIn the in the uh index of the technical papers of the society of automotive engineers\nYou will find several papers in which studies were done on various kinds of vehicles driving at various speeds both with the windows down in the air conditioner off and the windows up in the air conditioner on in in all cases\nThis gas mileage is better with the air conditioner on in the windows\nUp now ... says all cases that I have read off at least trucks to well let's roll goal yeah it's a truck yeah uh I mean\nAs my brother says the difference is not tremendous difference is not enough to make you want to have the windows up or down but the difference does become dramatic as the speed increases\nNo kid will think about what happens I think about the air flow around the car with the windows open\nAll kinds of weird things are happening wind is coming in windows going out and then we're the windows are up it's at least a somewhat smooth lemon are kind of flow that's going on which makes the car slide right through the air as opposed to being buffet around by the\nWay that the only word that you remember from Fluid Dynamics\nLemon ... yeah yeah it is that me too [laughter] I remember Eddie yeah are you eating hordes of course he was

all of a sudden all experienced is a loss of power that Carl start jerking and and and so that sounds like the rpm Z or going but there is nothing comes busting\nWhen you were wrong wrong wrong you mean it's it's surging\nYeah in ... and the cars also losing power goes um\nYeah ... and then what happened did you say once in a while it does this\nWell it started off doing it once in a while now it's almost to the point where it's kind of losing power and most of the time and then much law going run run run and getting power\nReally really ... and a stick shift yes stick shift feeling Jay how

Leon\nYeah I actually changed the filter last week\nAnd get out how many hours that take you a out too [laughter] hours that's not bad that's not\nBad again the circumstances under which this happens

the fuel I mean you know I like that answer because I thought that supported the fuel you'd think well it's yeah I was ... it doesn't help us at all\nThat [laughter]\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that are lean do health dot com slash kids\nMight people might be loaded or their food what you've gotta [laughter] I got another another clue\nWhat I'm going downhill it never happens yeah we knew that we know that yeah okay [laughter] I Know\nThat it's it's as you can shove the engine off another down [laughter] man's\nPower they're doing it too yeah yeah and when you when you demands power from the engine there were two things that you need well there are three things that you need you need air to support the combustion so you could have something as simple as a dirty air filled the but we know you've checked that yes are you\nOh oh oh oh [laughter]\n\nThis vehicle has if I'm not mistaken an air flow censor right at the airport the housing is that true\nAh I'm not sure\nShe's if it does what could have been laid it would not explaining his whole in the bellows between the Airflow sensor and the throttle a\nAnd that would explain 'cause that's when the demand for power is the greatest you step on the gas that hole in the bellows is allowing air to get into the engine but it it's not going through the air flow sensor and when that happens the\nDoesn't know that you've got a lot of air and therefore need a lot of fuel\nExactly so the computer things that you're still ... and it sends in an amount of fuel for the amount of air that she's going through the air flow meter uh-huh\nAnd therefore you have fuel starvation which would make you think that number one you had a bad fuel pump or clogged fuel filter so I Would look at that in fact you have that bellows between between the throttle in the air cleaner housing check to see if that isn't crack because considering that the vehicles a hundred and five years old it could be crap\n[laughter] your families and then they could be any number of things which are going to require that you go to repair shop because\nSomeone's going to have to test the fuel tank pressure and someone is going to have to test the coil and if all those two things are okay the next thing I suspected the nighter\n[noise] yeah I mean the\nGood part of the holy on is that if the car breaks down what would you care because you were in Honolulu\nI could still walk to the beach you can always walk to the you know what do you do it just ... like your surfboards in the back and stuff like that that's right you you don't actually worked or you know I Pretend to go to school where a University of Illinois and what are you what are you studying there\nOn protecting study geography\nOh that's a good ... Hawaii is a good place instead of geography [laughter]\nIt's a great excuse to you know go study the island show I've got to go here and study the geography here and go there\nYeah yeah and then on the way there's a beach hasn't geography pretty much been exhausted I mean [laughter] I mean [laughter] been wondering about how you hardly ever see terra incognito\n[laughter] yeah yeah so\nYou're like beating a dead horse here you're you're studying something that's pretty much been done before but that's good because there aren't old age to\nMe I mean a lot of what people were in school is among properly all of what they learn is one of the other people are thinking out already\nThat's the whole idea isn't it yeah just to bring you up to speed and just as you get up to speed you die", "show_name": "Best of Car Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "06"}
