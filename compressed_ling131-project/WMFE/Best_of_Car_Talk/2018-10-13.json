it's squeal for a couple of thousand miles and then eventually it snaps in a car overheat\nSo [laughter] I got to replace senator in repeats the whole thing every couple of thousand miles\nWell you know what to expect you would miss that just has a flat belt right if it's a flat groove the belt your ear conditioning\nI Do it sometimes it's ... or more with the air conditioning is on so if I'm if I'm stopped at a stoplight that squealing if people are staring at me I usually first thing I Do is just flip off the air conditioning and sometimes it stops oh but that won't accelerate as I go through the years and accelerate it starts squealing again as well\nEven without the the air conditioner on right yeah\nYeah because well I'm going to ... or is it something that's more likely to occur uh in the summer months more was greater frequency in the summer months\nI mean oftentimes as might we want we want you to think carefully before you answer [laughter] how many belt have you reflect a I'm On my fourth one now okay\nHow many of those happened in the months where are you from Charlottesville Charlottesville, Virginia yeah taught their focus in April May June July August September middle middle six months of the how many of them have failed during that time\nYou know I think this happened throughout the year and half yeah that's OK yeah we didn't really care what they're after a while [laughter] well\n[laughter] yeah you got to tell them which one it is [laughter]\nAnd I mean here's what I was leaning toward a link to it being I mean it's really not a defective belt we know that right or the and this is the kind of a system where it that there's not a belt engineer but in fact the Belgian engine\nBy the guy who installed that so one of two things happening either the belt is getting chewed up by a bad pulley or a bad uh accessory for example if your air conditioner compressor we are going bad\nIt could put so much of an extra load on the belt it makes the belt slipped and once that happens the belt wears out real quick yeah the other possibility we could be anything but what what what's your goal for this truck Mike I mean you you see another five years or another eight months\nYeah no another five years I'd like to drive it into the ground Raleigh stuff and ah you know so I'm not it's a little banged up and I'm not too concerned about it but uh yeah it's you know it's bother someone to do ... yeah well how does the belt is on there no uh about six months and it started to squeal again\nIt is yeah it was a tight knit you know take a lesson [laughter] not really ... after fellow\nWho's been changing them for you to show you how you might have to buy a couple of tools every working millimeter ... twelve millimeter ritual do it and and then you can tighten the belt yourself okay and and maybe you can prolong it'll get at the brakes went but I'm I'm guessing is the AC\nOkay good luck Mike ... thanks so much you got here by by taking\nOne eight eight eight ... eight eight eight double\nTo say why do we really help him I don't I mean he's a compressor I think he does too but that would mean he's not going to use the air conditioning from now until\nAbout ... once that's why suggest that team but he tighten the belt yeah because we tighten the belt now and it is an already destroyed it will last\nAll when they will lessen all winter exactly and if it does last them all winter I'm with you a hundred percent on the no I'd say the least\nLittle thing goes wrong and then you drop\nSupport for Ninety points of a news

I wasn't the case because you know how long was coffee you didn't have coffee for six or seven hours you know you wouldn't think so [laughter]\nBut number two it more likely is you had a bad connection uh-huh and then the third reason is the most jumper cables are junk [laughter] and and and the gauge of the wire is is so small that in fact there is a high number gauges go we'd reverse of the of the sickness of the wire\nThat they can't send enough current from the good batteries of the dead battery if you'll wait long enough\nIs it going this American Life one month before Seventeen people died and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida school did this intense training everybody in the schools aren't revamped new procedures what they were supposed to do in case someone set up at school and started shooting and we wondered did it help\nKevin ... people died this save lives did make things worse\nTeachers when this week [noise]\n\nListen in for this American Life with Ira Glass that begins this afternoon at four right here on Ninety point seven ...
