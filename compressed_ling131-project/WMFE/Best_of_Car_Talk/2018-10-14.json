I wasn't the case because you how long was coffee you didn't have coffee for six or seven hours you know you wouldn't think so [laughter]\nBut number two it more likely is that you had a bad connection uh-huh and then the third reason is the most jumper cables are junk [laughter] and and and the gauge of the wire is\nIs so small that in fact there is a high number gauges go we'd reverse of the of the sickness of the wire that they can't send enough coming from the good batteries of the dead battery if you\nWait long enough you don't get it through it'll get through it if you open up for two minutes and you say oh it didn't start you didn't wait long enough high jumper cables would start to think immediately okay she jumper cables you got to you've got to go for another couple of coffee [laughter]\nThere are four week until the mid term elections and voter enthusiasm is high but most people don't vote in the mid term one of the main reasons why I haven't learned he had always been the I don't know what I Need to bring\nI bought Ali been disenfranchised forever I don't believe that it actually factor who\nIs in voting and what would change if they did next time I'll let you from NPR\nBe sure to listen and that begins this evening at six right here on Ninety point seven F.

that mean what's going on down there well\nIt means that the that the the thing is worn out and that until the heat up and expand that it can hold the the er the pressure from the pump so that's why you don't get any power steering the fact\nThat uh you know after a while I'm driving okay that still dangerous\nNot real it's only dangerous those first few minutes okay because once it warms up it
