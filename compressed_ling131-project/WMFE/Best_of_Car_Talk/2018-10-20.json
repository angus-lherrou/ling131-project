fluid from time to time and as such he had this Kennedy's seat it may have been one of many Kansas she used\nYeah he was constantly adding break fluid to a leaking master cylinder\nAnd the master cylinder was leaking into the boost the power break butcher in every once in a while when she came to a stop especially in abrupt one or if the level of fluid in their words not with us not supposed to be any was high enough\nThat food would get sucked into the engine and make the same product Busta break fluid which causes the stumbling choke and maybe even stall and then once it worked its way through a company by this Belcher smoke up a tailpipe\nReally like a dream everything would be right and the subsequent stops wouldn't be a problem because she'd have to wait until enough fluid

Portland, Oregon what [laughter]\nI Want to say that all ready [laughter] anything\nJust out of all I'll let him continue\nSounded bogus [laughter] but in this\nBut it's good to watch this now go ahead Portland, Oregon as you may know read founded by two men\nFrom New England ... one of the man\nWas from Portland Maine and the other one was from Boston\nMassachusetts and they flip the coin to decide which seemed to use for the new city they will founding in Oregon and Portland one word simply for this one of the coin you could be calling from Boston Oregon right now\nAnd I'm sticking with that story [laughter]\nIt sounds it's just bad enough to be through\nThe well maybe like my puzzlers that there's some Historical Society there in in Portland are Boston if you want to call it that

skier in any of the ... and it's just it's been doing it for like five months\nAnd you've checked the floor of cause I checked the flu it have you ever changed the fluid\nAnd that's what I thought about having a transmission flushed but then some of the shops I talked to said you know if you do that you have thirty percent chance that you can wash out at the ocean some brand that might be keeping\nIt might be making it work [laughter] they want him on the debris right now [laughter] the ... theory\nThat if it's a it's a classic\nYeah I mean no sharp wants to be responsible for your not being able to drive out yeah ah we have run into this a few times and we always ah make people\nSign [laughter] document that says considering the\nGang of sound mind in somebody writing and ...\nThe the the serious nature of the problem with your transmission is entirely possible that have in Germany and you may have to be towed out here you know so so I I Would say that that a is a very good chance you should save your money on the transmission\nFlushing and devote all of it to the transmission rebuild [laughter]\nYou must have a hundred and forty five K. on this thing right\nThat's two hundred two hundred yeah\nIt's been my dad's car and he's taken it to the Audi shop regularly so he takes really\nCare and you had it for what six months six months if not breaking a month after you

could be a potential for to breathe or what\nI mean I don't know that is such a bogus\nSo why not get the transmission frustrating\nI why not ... as long as you're prepared and have the financial

Nissan Maxima manage my girlfriend's car and I'm shopping around for snow tires for this thing\nEvery place that I went to said they've refused to show me to write only show me four right there is something to this or is this just a ploy to get me to buy four tires when I really only need to\n[noise] I Wish I knew the answer to that [laughter]\nWell I I think the rationale behind the four\nOr is that they don't want to compromise the handling of the car by someone you two tires that are designed for snow only write and leave the other two tires on the car they're going to compromise the handling they want to compromise for all four wheeled equally and and where would you put the to\nThe to do it right on the front right and what they're saying is because of the abs it wouldn't make it showed the front would grab a lot more than the back in the back and would swing around\nYeah I mean it's not just because of the abs I mean NATO and in fact the yes it's supposed to prevent that that's what I thought yeah but what happens is if the front wheels have much better traction than the real ones\nThan the back end is gonna come around if you if you go into a skit so it it was all it is I think it's legitimate okay yeah I mean if you go around a curve\nAnd the front wheels have great traction and they go right around that curve back wheels have war worst traction and so they go where sideways sideways and all of a sudden the back under the cars in front of you how does that happen\n[laughter]\nYeah so for is the only reasonable answer OK okay I don't think they're trying to sell you tires that you don't need a nail salon you tie as they do need or one or not our kitty corner [noise]\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network
