everything's going to be fine but it's that one time that you have to be prepared for and ready to act on\nIf there's one place getting back to it being prepared it's Florida\nUm surprisingly for the state's dubbed the hurricane capital of the world there's a little bit of research happening here and how they work and how to mitigate their facts and as we'll hear later on in this program scientists in other parts of the world uh taking those findings and trying to test whether we can start ... altogether\nBut before that I Want to start with some basics what so hurricane and how does it for them why they say many of them here in the ... the United states\nWell if there's one person who can tell us that it's this guy professor Hugh Willoughby\nThey told me I'm a distinguished research professor to distinguish part means they don't have to pay me as much in the department of earth and environment for the international university\nHe's being modest he's one of the first as a hurricane hunters paving the way for the team he took us up and he explained how they form\nHer hurricane is strong circular storm that lives over the tropical oceans takes its energy from the warm waters of the sea\nPerkins work works dimensions the ocean as the board or and of course wind blowing around in circles turban\nHurricane Florence maybe a steam engine but it's one that's the size of a small country and its hustling across the Atlantic to the east coast these storms stops thousands of miles away in the Sahara Desert it's tiny disturbances in the flow of hothead streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture as a masterful but for what the scientists it's totally true\nMeteorologists always talk about power butterfly flaps its wings Omar can make it rained in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car in southern girl about every four days\nAnd every one of those could turn into something\nSo you get Seventy or eighty those during the course of the time when it's possible to make a hurricane ten percent or a little more grow into hurricanes most of them don't live up to their potential\nThe other thing harkens need room the will to that's a very particular recipe\nNotion surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters she huge amount of heat stored in that water and that's what the hurricane lives\nThese days the fact is in the U.S at least its own monitoring hurricanes which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a storm like Florence hits the ... ... is the deputy director of NOAA's hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nWe started way back when with a project called project storm fury the purpose of that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use silver iodide\nToo if you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening that didn't necessarily work for us and we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast\nSaid back when that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black cloud pretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our code and since then we've been improving the forecast what kinds of Tuesday you use to track heart can\nWe use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft to collect data\nOverland we'd we launch radio sons bitter weather ballooned\nWe have buoys out in the ocean we also use coastal radars so we all those those things to help us improve of how we can monitor the hurricane I'm a motor they all doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives has sort of um reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep those a thunder storms and hurricanes are\nAnd you've got on the table in front of us well it looks like a sin into that you ... percent poster inside\nWhat is it it is a drop one son does a GPS drop one son and we drop about twenty five from the belly of the aircraft into the storm and so we sort of pepper the storm with these instruments\nTo our morning are poor and Hurricane Florence making landfall thousands look\nNow somebody might wonder how TV weather forecasting snow so much about how storm is behaving [laughter] I just seemed it was all done remotely but no uh no today comes down to they drop suns send them to show you mentioned we have to be physically dropped out to the plane into a storm\nWe started the show on board just such a plane\nFor like two hundred miles north east of the storm center\nIt's cool to go on that I Know in name only ... off the Muppets and aside from cramped science stuff full of meteorologist\nBed till next technicians Terry ... in ... showed me how to release adults\nWho I'm bull bull straight out of the right side of private and\nWatch each song to power sheets through the storm into the sea measuring the weather at that particular point in the plane that checking to make sure everything's working\nYour end of the drops on his grandmother's drops on the board they look for is all these you want to bring British good\nEvery ten minutes Harry and Dana print and one of these cylinders and Kathleen though right into a sheet\nSo they're ...\nAny measure might be one of the ocean will do that\nHold for BBC around\nOne way to go and\nGet ahead something my big moment\nBut I don't get turned her

World Service doing science we're such on a plane or the waves its way through a hurricane why because this is crowned science the program that really goes that extra mile for in this case forty five thousand feet to the new science queries [noise]\nWeather predictions are really important to help people on land\nPrepared for the battering but listen to Kelly wants to know if we can control we can these storms\nWe heard earlier that to make a hurricane you need very particular conditions for one you need the ocean water to be more than twenty six degrees Celsius it might sound implausible but what if you could cool the seat to stop a secret stole him\nBefore we came out to Florida we paid a visit to Stephen sofa in America is professor at the University of Edinburgh he told us that is exactly what he plans today and he began by working out how much colder he'd need to make the sea to have an effect\nI think every engineering projects and stuff but I'm a single you energy so I've taken the area for America to the Caribbean and multiply that by assisted me just because of all evil tour of and said how much do we need to cool is with multiple to buy 'em so two degrees would be central number\nNow two degrees might not sound like much but we talking a vast area here that volume of water Steven mentioned imagine the entire United States so much to sixty meat is it that much if you could possible for fridge to cool it down it would take a huge amount of energy\nIt five times ten to Twenty one Jews as much as you think about it is the comparing really an injury of electrical generation in America when it comes out is over six hundred times that six\nHundred times the amount of electricity produced in the U.S in a year of course there's no way you can ... this way but professor ... look to the problem a different way\nWhy is the ocean woman the first place it takes a huge amount of energy to heat topped that much water that comes from the sun shining down on the oceans\nA new moon time in the summer it was about Thirteen sixty words per square meter coming in to the top of the atmosphere so what we need to do is to reflect the tiny bits of this searching sixty bucks to space\nAnd then it's not going to be warming up the ground and to see them their\nNature already has a way of reflecting some of that some backup into space before it hit the U.S it's\nCooled plowed Stevens says by modifying clouds by filling them with much smaller drops of water you can make them into better son shield", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In the Balance", "city": "Orlando", "day": "07"}
