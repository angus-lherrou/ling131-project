I came in thinking you know I'm a rational enough time to grade we noted there are these are the real very real physical well but actually I Do not want to do that either I learned\nYou know we have to send a professor just today we did yeah\nI think like me and I actually printed a couple of them out of\nMy mother's [noise] yes I think I'm\n\nYou with yeah just to see that you just said [noise]\nComfortable with you on on the street with I think is similar wishing it'll somebody you're not going to be able to change their life brings something about but thinking about it but would you want to it so easy for me to just ... to an rather\nJust not do that you don't have to think\nAbout space faring coming in retirement check at the civil emotional thing\nToday and when you do and to not check 'em your what he's like a little tricky changing something in your house to the ocean and during that\nThanks to Sophie page on no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the mail for that to mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though a new Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave entered Jane rising professor of behavioral science at Chicago University's School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo whether these superstitious or choose to kind of belief come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary my reason I think that\nThey are building on psychological process fees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are\nHere for a reason so for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen\nWe are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not so even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being constantly related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of thumb that our mind will rely on so\nIt's a a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program in ... there was a bit of the museum about view do and um but producing very cruelly brought along some pictures of my loved ones and I was off before I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so taking it with the outcome of anything happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of the lake now if you just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike and that is part of where the mood to believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children have been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online ...
