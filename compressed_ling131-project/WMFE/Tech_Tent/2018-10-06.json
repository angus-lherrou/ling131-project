I Am I'm willing to talk about anything you want so clouded its good here's a flavor of what's coming up about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still aren't registered as being more by the fifth birthday just about a billion people out there who don't exist basic\nFor Ninety planes and the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd beyond and does not require that extra energy that that streaming video does [noise]\nOwner that in a minute now over the past few years we've reported on this huge investments in virtual reality from the likes of Sony Facebook's Oculus division at HCC with its much praise divine system\nBut despite the billions of dollars spent on an overload of marketing sounds of their headsets approved well pretty disappointing it sees people may be wowed by the experience at first but the excitement so he wears off\nBut then you start up company from Finland aims to change perceptions with a high end headset promising human eye resolution and aimed at business uses\nThe company's ... on the team behind it had worked together at the Nokia Mobile phone business I go to them from one of the founders or who come to me\nSo what I'm seeing is and all the studio it's incredibly realistic it is it is as if I'm there which is quite different from a lot of the reality scenario lots of little models on the on the table and a mix of pain I could see through the ah the windows outside\nSo how did he do this we\nWent to the studio and two two thousand shots of the place in just two hours then a little bit of number crunching on this free to model came out of it automatically and we made this that you can you can crouch around you can see all sorts of things underneath the tables like everything is fully free they modeled in here\nAnd that's where I'm just living down there I can see down to the bottom of this truly that's right in front of me and this this is the titans factors on the bottom of a a little louder\nCan banks the head of social impact of the digital identity from your study was that our Jay Wakefield right here particularly in the digital IDs hadn't being fully embrace in developed countries so why should they do better elsewhere\nWhen you look at developing countries as a starting point it about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still I'm registered as\nBeing more by the fifth birthday just about a billion people out there who don't exist basically\nSaid it's just the kind of way as we've seen with other technologies in Africa and other developing um places of leapfrogging existing ways of getting things and gang straight to ditch to turn it\nIt is absolutely a pipe is still quite important to many of these places but if your going to and such like having sort of West African countries all across Asian countries that have been trying to help them to register\nChildren being bowl which is the best starting points to register to being bowl and then they tend to have an identity going forward so that's the that's the point that people are focusing on quite a lot but absolutely if you can go in at that stage and gives them a digital identity rather than giving them pipe then um they settled for life as they take politician the growing digital economy\nAnd what are some of the suggestions of how we could provide these ditched license teeth\nSo a couple of countries have been caught ... always been held up as being a a shining light from the the government will say for many years now and the stone ya\nCitizens have been able to interact with government services electronically and so the percentage of citizens voted in the last election and starting ya\nElectronically and these are things that we've been thinking about the u._k. for a very very long time in India that got odd ... which is what the foundation which they've now registered ... over a billion people a biometric play into it too large government base a base um\nBut on the lower level there's all sorts of solutions coming out which naval both registrations in registrations at lower level there's a company called element of have a phone based registration to where they take\nBabies fingerprints and footprints in order to um give them an initial biometric identity and there's a company called sim prince based in Cambridge\nWho use I bought a metric finger scanner which they take ... to various places and again use that to to register best now we've heard stories of doctors giving patients to injections for something he should have won because they had no way of knowing that being in the week before but without having and having any way of identifying them\nThose very very kind of basic problems an average creepy in and they can be life threatening\nDigital identity an ID causing general often feel people with worry about privacy concerns um how can you say the camps that they can sense\nRight well there are a number of different solutions and and uh I did kind of vying for the mainstream if if you say so recently at a wealthy banker event\nThat I attended looking at digital identities no people looking at block chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions um centralized solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on\nBut at the same time that our favorite political for hackers an auto recently got ... uh again reactor number of times recently got hacked and that's the system in India was over a billion people before register so absolutely there's concerns they're all um you know some ideas about using cell phones for an identity\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that hardly know health dot com slash kids\nSmall phone so I actually held by you rather than being held in the central place it can be hacked but at the moment there's a number of different solutions are the vying for the time um but the centralized ones which is the most common at the moment all the most vulnerable\nThat's Ken Banks now what have you done to minimize your carbon footprint and use less energy costs out eh travel perhaps so make your home more energy efficient but maybe you should also consider giving up Netflix Amazon Prime video another on demand video services\n... video streaming now accounts for the majority of global Internet traffic which in turn is consuming ever more electricity I've been finding out more\nAlexa turn the heat down to sixteen degrees\nThe heat set to think\nAbout you but I'm pretty green the temperature is set at a bracing level the loft is fully lines and all the appliances\nThat Senate ... will\nNow that's getting worse Terry [noise]\nNothing much on right now to talk of a choice of video on demand services to the VCR player Amazon Prime Netflix rule\nYou're right that this is where my husband gets a little less screen there's a lot involved when you flip on your television and watch something on Netflix for example\nDon't see Mike has asked of Lancaster University has been researching the growing energy use self video streaming which now accounts for the majority of the Internet traffic\nThe Internet today dissenters the digital devices are all account for about eight percent of global electricity demand and that's about three percent of carbon emissions which is roughly equivalent to the airline industry\nAnd because video streaming has such a large share more than fifty five percent of all Internet traffic um you could say that around three percent perhaps of global electricity to demand goes towards video streaming and supporting maps\nBut how does streaming video compassion energy use with good old fashioned Brokaw Stevie Chris ... is professor of computing sustainability at Bristol University\nI think we can definitively say that broadcast TV is definitely more efficient than video on demand a but on the other hand video on demand the more sophisticated service the Brokaw Stevie broke us TV effectively you're providing the same for everyone\nAnd if you can provide the same for everyone then you just need one a system to dispatch it to ... uh whereas a video on demand you need to a point to point relationships with each individual who's consuming figure any given time so inevitably it's going to use more energy\nIt doesn't use as much a additional energy as maybe I had feared when I first started looking into the problem but it is maybe two to three times as much as real cost\nGreenpeace has been running a campaign about the energy impact to the Internet and video streaming in particular who to click clean it encourages firms to use renewable power the campaign groups I T analyst Gary cook says consumers can make a difference\nWe've seen over and over that when consumers speak up and tell the companies that they want the queen bee aren't really sensitive\nAnd for Internet companies be our energy\nThey listened Facebook was the first company to make a commitment and two dozen eleven and they have consistently found for Apple also heard from their consumers twenty twelve customers speak up and say we want to do better or it is what are your competitors that carries a lot of power\nWe are to speak about Netflix and the BBC's Iceland team neither was available for an interview but each stressed that commitment to could ... environmental impact [noise]\nAround us should we stop streaming Mike has us from Lancaster University\nIf you're concerned about the environmental impacts of your your everyday life\nAre the main thing to think about with regards to streaming is whether that stream video is really being watched as a lot of times a a research found that\nVideo is used to provide a just background noise and and as it turns out a broadcast radio is an excellent way to provide that sort of that same sort of ambience and does not require that extra energy that that streaming video does\nThe professor Chris priest in Bristol says we shouldn't be too hard on myself\nI Would say it's not our job to feel guilty if the job of those who provide the services to engineer the services in such a way as to be as energy efficient as possible\nThat's Chris priest of personal university a chain Wakefield um some extraordinary figures here\nAbout uh I mean which I'm only gradually become aware of just how much bandwidth is being used a ... video knew he'd been doing\nIs to say on the company that does pull 'em founded management with sound fine for that report this week that looked pretty exactly at how much you can ... found sixty eight cents off\nThe ... and quite astonishing ... like the south takes account of Fifteen Percent of the world's bombed which which\nSeems extraordinary I mean we used to use the Internet for swapping documents and yeah no low bad with things and\nYeah all these what we what's the answer to get on the Internet yeah the\nAppetite for new content in a TV series Navy is isn't it getting ... and you know actually it's quite incredible it could be ... because ... states use a very efficient and taking technology thinking is that what do you top twice as much daytime slash ballot\nBut ... going to be stretched even thought that as people need more tools for K. content you know wanting everything in in plastic quality\nI turned about your household but we've gone from a position of everybody sitting in front of the broadcast TV to everybody on different devices range yeah ... most of the fact is is is that what you'll find\nSo lately that's um everybody wants to watch different things and in in different places and you know they need to we have to worry about using plastic bottles now if you have to worry about how much time with our family is using it maybe limit the amount of time they spend on line all day that's another discussion that we I'm sure we'll come back to another point\nYou're going to tell them what you might want to be so unpopular now that we've got time for all\nThanks to my colleague Jane Wakefield you can read all the stories that in mind that BBC don't come slash technology and you'll find my latest blog about this program I mean if you ask tell your friends about the punk of untied forget to join us again in the tent at the same time next week [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Tech Tent", "city": "Orlando", "day": "06"}
