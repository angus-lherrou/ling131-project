experiences that said no shellfish you think that you know you think you're just going to have a chance like we are and it's like I said\nYeah you don't get a good conversation with the right button\nLet's move on the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one business he's trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones ... is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I asked him what kind of people used it\nAgainst their primary level we're targeting people who don't have those other ways of communicating with each other a so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet or on there for a massive information gap of finding\nA information the knowledge and how to improve the farmer or bottle a disease now so we farm or we need all those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or get spoke content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology it's SMS just does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front end ... messes obviously a hundred and sixty character is it's a very simple information format by I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology has to be behind the scenes in order to get good contents people in such a simple for months\nOr so when a former U.S as a question for example on on a semester we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis to match them two or three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question\nAgain not just for content back to the original farmer\nNow you've you've got to a million members I think you just signed up a million the million member\nWalk what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people [noise]\nYeah so it would pass a million which is as I was a great milestone for us having to one million I'm I mean I think that's the first thing they get a indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nAnd even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know it in context there's it's probably nearer to seven or eight percent on Twitter um you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month\nWhich gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun system two years it's not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicator would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information that's helping to save their their livelihoods and farms through before\nIt was an example of how it's being used as an example I\nI Would give is that there's a a chicken farmer that I was using we farm in Kenya called ... he got something in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school up at dinner and you finally table\nOr on a disease was ... killed you know roughly half of them in the space with a couple of days or any ask questions about this and we farming get information back\nAh which vaccines to you is how do I just stopped a disease spreading and he managed to save the rest of the chicken um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of vital you know often seems to us fairly basic information but it's incredibly fundamental to these farmers but that we found is able to to to provide\nLike Kenny you in from we from\nA Mona El sol are from the ...
