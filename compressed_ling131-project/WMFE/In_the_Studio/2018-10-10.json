creation of the game that and the plane\n[laughter] oh yeah very much though it was a that was the making was the fun of it but they totally crash or does it does it work that little cycle they're like create something in them and poke at it and see you know I was in each one coming out when it's pretty easy\nRight well I think that I think I'm coming up to my time limit on this line among the boutique he said would be a great time for me to actually kind of have a look at what you do in the next stage maybe\nUh let's see we've got to be mentioned on gender on August or three years we've actually brought a variation in common in touch with people in the evening [noise]\n... ... ... we can line about way we are\nIn the creation of print that make like a senior season three you'll watch in small find videos from across the U.S human ... cells I think he ruined Lewis showers war has been happening since I\nWent to rally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically the the entire year of the game developed so it's sort of like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place an hour refining that and trying to make it better and better says it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is and now it's just about making it better than me a story that the times kind of a yeah that's right tell each game is a a month so sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel\nAnd now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the games kind of reinforce that ending\nSemi this whole with tens of thousands of people in it will qualities and some real work will begin swapping tonight tonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to a meeting up with some place outdoors\nIn a conference room in a hotel at some secret location a plane to season three and I'll be watching it with a note that in hand really seeing how the out of the box experience works how their first games work\nAnd I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend um had tonight it's going to be two couples for player game we recruited them off the Internet using Twitter\nOn those people I Do not know I've never met we get a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard so you're kind of feel like I'm tired\nOf all I Know I don't see how it's what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not in one thing as much as possible in front of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich state of being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nI just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible this will make the scientific discipline that you go back to the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their questions unless they get really stop you know\nI don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nPutting the creation of those rules is an international business world ... only on the late to legacy versions of pandemic [noise]\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a book that's full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game as translate into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or having to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nPulled on languages from other countries so turned back in the whole game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you're like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nAnd there'd be just a if not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon put that on a cover you just so in Germany so it it'd be a trip to think of a language it because we can help you played\nSo we got kind of postal German fatigue with combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games by that [noise] it fit into\nWhat were called German games that I Need some in Europe games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict they added designed games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in the place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only get you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I've been taking anything from you I just prevented you from getting something\nIs is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about four games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game designer over the past Twenty years just from this post more aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred gays develop their general cone spelling games about everything you can imagine titles about ... you know ... ... ... creations of supernatural steam punk\nTempting to think in a world of PlayStation or an X. box ... if a wreck trade courage that\nSpeaking to him about his career I found out that the work that he said it's still having a massive influence on the way that we lay down\nMy mood that they're selling ballet Nineteen Ninety seven I got a job at a cleric reparation started apple so it was like this exciting job I was doing it happened to leave Midwestern and make my way out to California\nI think they're all four months before I got laid off and really got it got a sense of what the Silicon Valley lifestyle as I said I didn't know much security yeah exactly there's a lot of turnover but you just kind of got adept at at switching jobs and you maintain that big network of people and it was really exciting\nAnd and the right in saying that you were working on what we call the personalization of the wet\nWhen I was working we were just starting to do what with social networking those apps are just kind of coming out of the scene that was working on Yahoo and it was a lead interaction designer working a lot of their social I guess what now you'd call social networking applications\nFor Ninety planes and the news comes from Orlando how are they end up

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nReally on the edge when I was working on it we're just beginning to understand what they like to make an update that you'd share with people and now you know it's ubiquitous you see it on Twitter is you know basically ... everywhere but it back in time we were just kind of learning with us interaction patterns where it started happening to document those and share those events rise up across Yasser\nSuch such a critique of finding still ... culture now isn't it yeah I mean it's like I said if you figure if you see it everywhere I mean people are chicken and I found hundreds of times a day\nWhich really struck me the the two days it's a you know work in an old Scully analog failed he's kind of on plugged from something that society is awash with now facial media because about face to face contact\nYeah it's one thing I really liked about tabletop gaming ... it's very different from a electronic and making that you you're playing with people across the table here making eye contact it's like this medium for connecting across your dining room table it gives people an excuse to to be with each other and that that is one thing I really love [noise]\nWhat's the importance of this time away from screens that games like yours allow\nBiting their devices that really isolating you know when you're on on your eye patter your honor X. box or whatever they say they forget to connect with people on those games off of this great way especially popular games operate right way to really communicate with people and connect reconnect
