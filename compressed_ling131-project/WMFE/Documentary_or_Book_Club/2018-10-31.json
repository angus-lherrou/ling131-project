taking the Americans to own decide if they could have\nPut pressure on for a ceasefire ages ago [noise]\nYes I I think that's right and I think\nFrom my perspective there's a lot of that could have been done a lot for a call for this cease fire but the ceasefire is a technical breaks or in this war and I woke a recognition that the current policy it's failing and it's a recognition that there is no military solution to the end of the war in Yemen there's only a diplomatic solution\nAnd urging people to get around the table and negotiate for peace is absolutely needs to happen and as you are\nAbsolutely needs to happen for that humanitarian aid can be delivered to the people and the men who are suffering the most the innocent civilians twenty two million people in need of humanitarian

breakthrough and I think it's it's the first time we've seen this or something like this and that and a number of years and\nIt does give us hope that this could bring about an end to the war um but at the same time there is more that the U.S and the u._k. should be doing going what are the ads military suppliers to the Saudi led coalition and they had significant leverage an overt\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates who are involved in a war and and supporting that Mike Griffin has you know play for to bring the sides together and have peace talks it's it's definitely something that
