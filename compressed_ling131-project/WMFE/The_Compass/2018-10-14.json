{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WMFE", "content": "I'm elected and it's worse than national bald local politics as far dirtier um people get mad at you in the grocery store 'cause their their garbage was collected um the thing though I Would tell you is to go full circle to wear this night began or just yeah don't\nYou shoot motives to someone when you don't really know their motives [noise]\nUm a lot of people believe a lot of things some people believe things that are mutually contradictory I think we all do I know I Do um but don't him shooting motives to the person you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background\nAnd we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PTA or or ... it may not be that they just want to a ... way to get their kid to hit it over your kid they may have real\nReal reasons for wanted ... getting out of a beauty motives would go a long way to helping things\n... [noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people a sense an argument their brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like dormant in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we've had a quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexico so [laughter]\nBut if there are studies that you know look kids who go to\nRacially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities\nAnd after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually that actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we have 'em\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition\nIs that we we don't we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally\nSays I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them that we're paying your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in Kansas there'll be\nOn social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um what is the experience you have of what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself him up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [laughter]\nUm but it and then as well mhm ah people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like ah and I\nHad the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories\nOf people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things\nAnd who the target of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking more hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that\nA way this project is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not easy\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that Arlen do health dot com slash kids'\nCases it's too much to add to laugh at us and the other hand\nThis is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they're all\nExtraordinary and beautiful and equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nYou ... I'm always struck um ... ... if it just riddles to some degree or what is the first bad in scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel\nAnd it's not the fall short but in the apple especially in the garden of Eden before evil even ears the world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us can cocked relationships in communities on line and we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribe a Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will that tribes then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people\nYou know we were with a wife who has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line\nA and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ... that we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nUm that level of local you know I don't mean to keep working at a local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know\nUm there's a there's a great Christian ... Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that are blessed scenes are blessed to be shared with me\nFree Jesus fault", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Compass", "city": "Orlando", "day": "14"}
