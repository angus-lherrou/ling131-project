know sometimes I feel like we we hit the twenty first century and I I think of this has kind of spiritual technology like meditation and mindfulness and contemplation and yeah yeah and tell us like we like we're discovering all these other technology and and I'm we're kind of\nWaking up to their spiritual technology that we just need to go back to our sensors almost I mean I Wonder a lot about\nYou know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting\nYeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and were never in a while I was engaged with our phones [noise] damn I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do if I write\nDid we I mean you're talking about looking at a lead but I mean did we look\nAround and I mean I Know there was born ... there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world and we were standing\nIn yeah that is completely gone now daydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain um I don't think we do as much of that\n[laughter] teaching these students also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and and a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but [laughter] son did show us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know those sites like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three bread thin and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter]\nFor their phones and brought lying down for far right [laughter] they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sacrilegious right [laughter] right well\nOkay so I knew that I work as Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is\nPure and um but you also written about ... cherry practical\nLike mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing when you talk about that yeah that's really interesting yeah yeah um\nWe devise that at Google loves that she put it in her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop\nTakes fury depressed folly of brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then\nYou read the email and you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on an emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to thank you I mean you're offering more than you actually are\nWhat whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it\nThere was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go and um they all said that was radical you know me using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone [laughter]\nRight [laughter]\nSo yeah I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful\nWanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really have to get off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but when mindfulness compassion practices and others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand for repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and been noticed what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes your mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate echoing I'm Andy and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and\nThey lost everything about that I wanted to ask you about that is so interesting especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter]\nIt's I mean we ... we laugh but it's yeah you know it's a date with lawyers will\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of might be point do you remember it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising called fire with Dr ... how we do it now that you might be family\nDoes your support ... uninterrupted programming but donating a dollar a day with him every ... call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOf course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment it's eliminating pre judgment so that date judges are\nUnbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it as a pet to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting right like physically like what we experienced as a present wise to yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is I sing meditate or ... have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do it all of the yeah [noise]\nI'm ... and dissident ai being today with the footage teacher nearby who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practice [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise] it's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and ah and I should say like for myself I have some\nAnd had many experiences across the years on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be out just transformative and now they're safe and all that science about how good it is for us on the ferry made a biological levels and stress and all of that [noise]\nBut it's very hard to\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know he decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while mighty states which just seems so pathetic but yeah it's a hard time yeah\nAnd I wonder um everyone SUV she worked with so many different practices I mean are there is
