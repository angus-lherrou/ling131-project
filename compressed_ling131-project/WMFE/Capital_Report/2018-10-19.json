and the rural larger agricultural areas in northeast Florida in southeast Georgia were badly damaged\nIt's going to be a long time before the economy in that area recovers I mean we're talking years Nicole regrettably what about even further out well further out this going to be consequences to this I mean the recent increase in hurricane frequency and intensity\nWilling avidly boost property insurance rates in Florida and across the country\nAnd I think over the next ten years those rates will rise sufficiently to begin to affect the market value of coastal real estate in Florida and that could have very significant consequences for development activities and also for the tax revenues throughout the state of Florida\nSo these are trends that are going to occur and we need to start planning for these eventuality cynical how would we do that\nWell a number of things or we can begin to move development increasingly away from the high hazard areas we can begin to increase the insurance costs and other regulations so that we don't have an abrupt cliff effect\nYou know all of a sudden one day nobody wants to write insurance that's a very abrupt change it would be much better to do this gradually\nEven though it will be painful but some graduate changing rates in regulations is what's called for a nickel thank you very much for your time zinc\nThank you [noise] that's Florida economists Hank fish kind speaking with W ... crushed [noise]\nStill to come on Capitol reports the storm puts become boss just state wide political campaigns at least for a little while\n'til we cancelled our fundraisers and what I did is I had public rallies schedule yesterday and today we converted those same to supply drives\nAmong them any election issues facing voters this election cycle an amendment fasting crime victims rights into constitutional concrete not everyone thinks it's a good idea but I Do not believe that he is actually serves any real purpose to decide that

begins this coming Monday and some key races have now changed this election is happening just as the panhandle trying to recover from that storm voters could be casting their ballots based on how candidates responded to the catastrophe\nEspecially the candidates for governor and US Senate\nW ELL RNs Alexander Gonzalez looked into that\nIn the days leading up to hurricane Michael's landfall governor Rick Scott did what any Florida governor would do during a hurricane warn people\nFor Kaine Michael is a monster storm and the forecast give any more dangerous\nA monster storm in the fourth hurricanes kind of had to respond to in his eight years as governor after hurricane Michael past Scott's shifted from warnings to grab a toss\nHurricane Michael is the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen\nGod is doing his job as governor but he's also a candidate running for US Senate seat against democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson that means Scott's response could make or break his campaign\nJust the day before hurricane Michael approached the panhandle Scott got more than fifty eight hundred mentions on TV according to political that was ten times more than his opponent notes and try to keep up appearances on CNN and on PBS NewsHour\nA certainly I Hope it does it do for\nThe panhandle of Florida what it did and butter Rico because they were treated as second class citizens\nIn an interview about the hurricanes news hours Judy Woodruff eventually ask Nelson about the campaign\nOut your opponent in the Senate race that Governor Rick Scott says he's going to be suspending his campaigning for the next day we are you doing the same thing\nUh yes ma'am we've suspended are ah commercials in this area\nUh by the way a and other parts of Florida he is not but now is not the time to talk about politics now is the time to talk\nAbout getting people made whole again\nAnd according to political superPACs backing both Scott and Nelson ram negative campaign ads in areas that were bracing for hurricane Michael but Scott got the better bargain says columnist Diane Roberts shorter peace about it for the Washington Post\nHe got the free media because he is the governor of the state it's cheaper than buying a campaign ad\nMayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum benefited from free media to the Democratic candidate for governor was seen filling sandbags and the days before the hurricane Republican candidate Rhonda Sanchez is in a different situation from Gillum Scott and Nelson he no longer holds elected office\nAs Michael was crossing the pan handle the senses explained his campaign plan on Fox News\nSo we cancelled our fundraisers and what I did is I had public rallies scheduled yesterday and today we converted those into supply drive so the campaign we\nRented and while hurricane Michael was barreling towards the pan handle the Republican Party ran this ad criticizing dealings response to hurricane her me two years ago\nAfter the hurricane had no electricity for over a week [noise] Kennedy ... mind are trapped sort of star power [noise]\n... how on earth\nHere's Gillum on MSNBC\nMy opponent has decided to leave all of his negative negative advertising of all the way across the panhandle including right here where we're preparing our citizens for category for hurricane impact um I Would encourage my opponent does to justify the politics will have plenty\nOf doing campaign responded to that ad in the ... own ad hurricanes don't have a party affiliation and neither should our response efforts and an event in Tampa reporters asked us answers about the Republican Party is added he said quote you run your campaign the way you run your campaign it is what it is\nA Republican Party spokeswoman tweeted that it had ordered the ads taken down in places affected by the storm\nThe races for governor and senator we're both both have debates this week and were cancelled to focus on hurricane recovery efforts Scott campaign put out a new ad on Tuesday the day after he said he'd be taking a break from campaigning senator Nelson\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Ninety point seven
