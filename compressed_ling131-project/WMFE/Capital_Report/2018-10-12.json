{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WMFE", "content": "That says if you live longer than it is a better quality of your life which is completely\nFalse remember a forest or a church there was a Unitarian minister wrote a number of books but one of them is called the devil and Dr Church and he says in there you need to look at for instance even living a healthy life is your goal is maturing live forever rethink while you're living healthier [laughter] there's better reasons\nThis is a great discussion I Know that on friends talking faith it's not the uh\nThe quantity of the thirty minutes that we have this show but it's really the quality right that really makes a difference what we're going forward it this is great we have a lot more to talk about regarding this question of quantity versus quality of life stay with us after a short break we'll be right back\nYou're listening to the three wise guy I mean my mum and mostly a member subscribe to our podcast on your iPhone or Android device tied to use Google Play Pasca [noise] just search for friends talking face that way for never miss another episode\nComing up have you ever thought about questions like what does the meaning of my life why am I here\nWhat is all about [noise] we'll spend some time talking about those questions that's next [noise]\nAs we continue our discussion regarding this question about the quantity of life and the quality of life\nLet's talk a little bit more about this question of our search for meaning as human beings most of us have at least heard the name Victor Franco many of us have read what is arguably his best known book entitled man's search for meaning\nOver the years that sold more than ten million copies worldwide between Nineteen forty two and Nineteen\nForty five Frankel labor and for different Nazi death camps including our Schmitz I'm rabbi what'd you get started on this conversation about our search for meaning from the perspective of Judaism\nWell rev I'm Glad that you chose the Victor Franco 'cause I think he's a good model for what we're speaking about not only was he a Holocaust survivor but he was also a psychoanalyst\nSo he really understood the human mind he understood human beings and I remember one of those things are striking line from the book was\nHe talked about that the Nazis took every single quality thing away from in his life they took away his\nHis humanity they took away their identity they took away their family all those things that we would think that makes someone have a quality of life their home their their friends their community\nThe Nazis took everything away from him but he said that when push came to shop for him as a human being\nThat there's one thing that the Nazis could never take away from him and this one thing was that which he thought would determine a person's life\nAnd that was they could never take away from anybody the ability to choose in other words choose what they would want to do choose how they would act\nChoose who their family or friends would be\nShoes whatever moral direction they wanted to take that as something that can never be taken from a human being and if we're talking about\nLife I think that Frankel and I think it's a very Jewish perspective too that we went to find that a person's quality of life is based on the decisions that they make the choice that may make\nReally determine what kind of quality of life all they have if you ask what how is my life going to be made measured we've spoken about it's going to be measured by the choices that you made given the life that you had thrown or port or chose to be put in front of yourself\nAnd that is really what Frankel felt would be the meaning of a person's life\nIs or even when the rabbi as you're saying even when someone does something so horrific to you Franco was saying you still have a choice about who you will cause in\nThe ... I mean that's one of those those survivors those people in the camps could have become aggressors\nThey could've been done in moral things but they chose to maintain their humanity their relationship with each other their connection to God I mean they had choices to make that no one could take\n... you know and a lot of times in life we have things that just happened to us we don't have a choice of whether we get a disease we don't have a choice of whether someone hurts us\nThose things but we do have a choice of how we respond so I think part of it is yes rap the way that we respond to the stuff that's thrown at us in our lives\nSo this is about our internal processes this about how we struggle internally to do what's the the righteous the good a holy thing to do is that is that is that the understanding of jihad and in Islam that you struggled to go it's the inner struggle right that's really what it is\nYou know to to to stay a living according to your principles into your beliefs and to really um defy all the odds to be who you are supposed to be\nA sofa from the Islamic perspective the quality of life is measured by your abilities success to walk with God in Rochester is to do the right things to do the things that these guys in the body gone in in your\nManners and your morals and you attribute\nIt to be out like two words all people starting with yourself than your family around you your spouse your children which now your community your neighbors and how what with God do for this world and you are God's agent\nCarrying how this works so the the more that you are in accordance with that plan then you have a good quality of life when you diverged from that and you get you know distracted\nThe first thing I Need to have a new one comes from Eileen Dole health\nOr they know how network a pediatrician that committed to tell them tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being sometimes can they all had quitting is all important teenage years later how positive or twenty pediatric location to parents bunch up for the family more information including locations that Eileen Dole health dot com slash kids\nYour life you may have a lot of power you might be in charge of the country but uh\nMaybe everybody in that country hates you and you are destroying everybody's lives so the Islamic perspective is that you need to do good and how much good do you do is determines what kind of quality of life you have\nDo you get is um I bet you get even more upset than idea when you hear jihad being used in relation to terrorists because it's so nonsensical not\nConnected it's every harm email and the fat off as yeah yeah yeah it's just amazing in in Christianity much that you you guys have really covered it I think in Christianity just borrowed from your agrees with you that it is this question about\nThe heart the internal mechanisms there's even when we talked about the surround them out quote a little bit about don't worry about kind of what's going to happen to you just\nDo today what you need to do and there's a part in there that talks about the heart\nThat that's where your treasure should be stored not in things that are basically consumable by moth and rust and so on but rather your your heart is with God in heaven and that's how you should kind of focus your life\nAnd what are we talking about the sermon them out by the way some Christians have said if you just try to live by that\nYou're gonna you're gonna spend your whole life just striving to really be the good person to discern that cause you to be and I find it fascinating that people rabbi and want to put the ten commandments up and um you know courthouses and Congress and all these places but\nThey date but nobody talks about putting up the attitudes disarm them out so blessed are the peacemakers maybe in the Pentagon I'm blessed are the make\nOr maybe in Congress I'm blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness maybe in the White House um I mean I'm just thinking maybe there are some places that little parts of that might be might be nice to put up\nWe focus a lot on the wrong thing and that's when we're living externally rather than as as you all have talked about living internally in in\nYou know I think the culture the de emphasizes allowed the wrong quality of life they measure quality by how much money and how many people follow you on on Facebook or Twitter\nWell we measure everything we measure our government that way we measure our society that way we measure success that way we from religious perspective I think you would disagree how the measurement that we use as as we have all said there's something much deeper in such something more meaningful\nVery very much more and thank you for this\nVery and I don't want to be tried them out of bed very meaningful conversation on the meaning of life because I think that's where the heart of who we are called the baby is it really is [noise] there's more to come in our conversation about quantity and quality of life a search for meaning as human beings will pick up the conversation after a short break please stay with us [noise]\nYou're
