taken for granted pace on this continent because it's there nothing is a given my biggest worry and I do some that are with us sometimes is that we wonder what the European Union\nGood which was

say which blocked writing a high rise environment that's not too bad that's not too much the problem in fact they're pretty ... pretty good\nThe biggest problem with ... a hammock chair and itchy can

a huge in here and see if we can fly for several hours that the ... sort of technology we've got\n... the shit it's totally any good for about half an hour all three cool spin out so that doesn't give us the safety margins it would be somebody within the past so in other words the performance that we see is actually\nThe issue is trying to make that happen over a long period of time sitting here

saying some of those involved in driving than you tack like engineering ... top ... go Eric uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where he got on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or soon as possible and an upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in about ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft a new business models actually where you know the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combined airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York\nOr London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus slips in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft\nAnd the ones using hybrid electric power trends like the ones that very goes developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology come into play and the diversity of aircraft types that grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a tax is going to be picking me up from a and then my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about wind what's safe from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think is the most traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on the ... you might have gotten older they have ... regulations that perhaps they are the most like you'd like to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us who this industry are actually watching the self polo market very carefully\nRight now today and so although there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on tops of the buildings around the study\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something the theoretical it actually already exist in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year we all find ourselves in these cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting it I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now

there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job and galvanizing the industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is while it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but really but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and to be finding places in big cities to land I guess but is this going to start in Europe and America or is it going to start somewhere else where about half the regulatory hurdles the last time\nI think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right into the water bottle bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of islands to jumper ... less dangerous for that reason because when you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you
