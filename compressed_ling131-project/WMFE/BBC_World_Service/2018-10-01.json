about learning it\nI think that's a really good point I think one of the things is that we know that when you're very young it is a time when people feel era motions very intensely and also this may be the first time that you felt this this painful feeling of loneliness\nAnd older people may have the experience to have lumps that it usually policies because we know that most loneliness is temporary and they usually people get out of it\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that ... people who are older to look back and we all them when they were the loneliness of all they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it something about more life I think the main ways of being the case it was just never measured before it may be

La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be comma every year has some extremes willed is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the U.S just him sign center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks chops occur off tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah sign up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks early night among annual averages fu ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate story and know the ... mountains to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public to policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase in\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets are et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to\nThat's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time honored television screens it in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every year\nYou write that one into what is not necessarily harming our what accountant which is why won't do echinacea or any of them are and I think this summer and it's\nRight to say this is something different something that can be\nQuite rare and now they call it and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you'd take\nExtreme drought you combined it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream\nIn a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high struck just very jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California west seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael mine\nIt's getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um those summer droughts\nAre so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season in California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of
