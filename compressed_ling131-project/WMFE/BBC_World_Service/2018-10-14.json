this time [noise]\nVery nice feelings like very very nice feeling dishes the family that I was waiting for a long time\nUm they've not even be living together for a week it was six days ago to 'em it moved in to it smells so he was a truly inspirational young men are with me in the studio robe Jody Jay tightly and Ron I'm Michelle I'm Rob ...\nYou can probably identify with that story because you also learned undocumented immigrant\n[noise] I'm absolutely I left Liberia when I was six years old I'm moved to the United states to draw my mother and my father\nAnd pretty much overstayed my visa and lived in undocumented man limbo from the time I was six until I was about Twenty years old\nSo hearing that story what it really sets to me is you know they sort of racist than a phobic populist notions that uh migrants are um a purge on society that they are swarm who come in and feed off a system finite resources for those who are not documented\nUm who are documented I should say it's just complete mess um this young man is low is emblematic of the sheer resilience and the bread and the hard work\nThat migrants put in a many of them come from very difficult circumstances not for me I left Liberia before the war started but as a result of the war I had to remain in the United states and my parents shielded me for almost fourteen years from that fourteen year armed conflict um and as a result of that my parents have to work exceedingly hard\nUm to pay for very exorbitant immigration fees to send me to private schools because public schools as too much questions about my status\nUm and so I think listening to this story should make a lot of us rethink our notions about migrants whether they be documented or undocumented that they actually contribute meaningfully to
