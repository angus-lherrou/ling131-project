Amanda focused on a freelance journalist from Belfast in Northern Ireland\nIreland divided into two jurisdictions the republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland which is part of the u._k. so governed by Britain within Northern Ireland\nOr sort of three sets of people there are people who have the British identity people have an Irish should end today and then to grow up in the middle that have a mixture of those identities\nSo the union is that people with the British identity one term in part of the United kingdom whereas the other side won the whole island of Ireland to be one\nNation and not to be governed by Britain so that's what the conflict came into it and not stellar cultural war still a political war so the Nineteen Ninety eight Good Friday agreement the peace process data that was signed has given Northern Ireland a degree of stability prior to that\nWas you know decades of conflict ... murders and bombs and people were fair to the troubles which\nDoesn't seem adequate enough to me it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland there would've been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI must have peace day not fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go without any restriction Reno without having to show documents and the idea that you might go back to there being any sort of see it presents or a military presence or anything like that along the border as if the concern to people\nPeople took the risk of finance returning if there is April will to we established between the Irish republican ... and it's a real threat\nI think that it is you know when people talk about a return to the trouble is I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think about the hard border would introduce would bring all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups so I guess it and Republicans and what are most senior police officer and Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton is sad\nIs that if it was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are carrying that work would become a target\nAnd it's the police Judy to defend people here are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here how serious concerns about bought a new a hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view if\nAll that people in all the non and too I Would actually like to see the ball to come back\nWell everybody says you know the political parties in Northern Ireland volt persuasion is old said that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that it was on an account be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that the Northern Ireland wouldn't be excluded from not\nWhereas the majority of the parties have you back so it's sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and they said to me you know we've had in our hands because we're paying for this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement on it's not being accepted as\nHow much of a discussion topic is so the people on the day to day basis in way you are in South ... is it something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time\nIt's something that everybody's talking about a day in day I\nWalk practice that has done is put the issue of the constitutional position\nHigh up onto the agenda where maybe it hadn't pain in the past the PC that's sort of felt the constitutional position whereas no I was ... said people here are talking not by the Irish unity and away The Waltons on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting that union is feeding the practice it will strength and northern Ireland's union with Britain\nWhereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually if I didn't fight is one of the British union aside if things are nice starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances I'm certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every\nTV show every talk show every polling old up by these questions you know what he wants to the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel it but\nThe idea of Irish unity\nIn the middle of the big storm and everybody's looking at us not least because we're going to be the border between you and the u._k. but also in the context of the D.

give me he's being tugged in all kinds of different directions hearing these different views well\nMichelle ... team and the U.N General are fully aware of the domestic political situation in the

time rather than the opposition parties and that ...\nUm what's currently the view in Brussels sub out a deal being struck the phone next march\nThere is optimism that there will be a deal\nBut there is concern that the u._k. is just not in a position to accept what has become the most controversial parts of the withdrawal agreement of the ... divorce treaty\nWhich is that infamous back so the idea that you'd have an insurance policy to aboard the re in the void to re introduction of a border\nBetween Northern Ireland and Arlen which the ease that ultimately has to include a clause that says Northern Ireland could stay in the use customs union just no as an intention to ... that would be the case but just that would be the ultimate backup auction\nAt new other trade deal or no other arrangements could be fines to avoid a hard border\nThe case has absolutely no way can be accept that because that would\nThe constitutional integrity of the u._k. efforts to be made to make that

country and in most countries in the world now ... and all are ways that they were there to becoming more limited so we have fewer and we can use and some of these patients and that's the real concern is getting more bucks at the very resistant to antibiotics we called\nSo what is this ... this one that could be more effective\nTo fit a recall is is the new antibiotic I Believe it's pronounced [noise] um so this is a kind of tweak on an existing into politics so it takes an existing clients and politics and it puts on an additional components which ... which bacteria will take can cite them\nSo it's been described as a Trojan Horse which is a bit simple but it's probably quite helpful so bacteria have a wolf which protects them but it's not just to stop it will take things in and out\nAnd bacteria very good at figuring things out over the world if they didn't like it including antibiotics but when a factor in people and that doesn't mean response trying to get rid of that infection that's a tough on the body tries to keep on bacteria one time and they have special molecules to bring on it and say what this antibiotic has done is to\nAttach one of these molecules so the bacteria take the antibiotic in times of stress and get it inside bacteria and so\nIn doing that it becomes a lot of the natural resistance that bacteria have some other antibiotics ended up being human trials some yeah so that so that they have a saint published today we heard about a few months ago but it's encouraging face to date and we have these antibiotics that go through\nThree phases for their proof and so this is the end of the second phase of development and this was a trial in adults with urine infection\nComplicated ear infections that people getting admitted to hospital with kidney infection or bladder infection\nNeeding intravenous antibiotics and they were given either their sense of Baltic will and will stand it on the wealthy and um they did at least is what if not better when you went to Boston but she's very encouraging but it's not we still need more takes me just one type of infection so antibiotic\nItself could be a more effective but what about that problem than identified the abuse and misuse of antibiotics some making resistance develops become\nSo there I mean it's a very complicated issue and there are lots of different types of different things that needs to be done but to get three examples than one way of reducing the amount of emphasis we use these by preventing infection with vaccinations if you get your flu vaccines when to your chances of getting a foreign infection go down but then on top of that if you could have bacterial infection you antibiotics\nSo the vaccination can help us in that way\nAnd and it was so helpful to get rid of the expectation from people that they should have and so when you go to a doctor feeding 'em well\nHaving an expectation of antibiotics leads to increased prescribing\nAnd then I thought he was a whole use my Hawaii than just in human health and not everybody recognizes that um but we use a large amount of antibiotics in animals and I think knowing the sort of antibiotics in the food you eat as important as seeing some of the larger food chains now controlling it also is ... ... can be done to prevent the ever you spent six in very different way protest\nAnd many things professor
