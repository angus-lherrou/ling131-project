attacks because again that's the other thing about cyber attacks is going about tracing them back to a certain individual proving that an explaining that to a public well\nWe do have a pretty robust

footprint\nIt is impossible to be completely anonymous online I if you're a Gulf up again individual school about the same professional documents in this case we had a number of Russian intelligence

indeed\n[noise]\nAnd now let's take a look back at the century old master could we used to have hundreds of African Americans dead in the city of Tulsa in Oklahoma\nThe pages may Nineteen Twenty one has been described as one of the worst episodes of racial violence in us history when a white mob descended on the area of Greenwood setting fires in the hundreds of black owned businesses and hung killing more than three hundred black people and leaving more than ten thousand\nAfter many calls for a detailed probe into what actually happened it's also as mayor has said that there will not be an investigation into whether there are a mass graves in the city from that time\nThe announcements comes as Tulsa prepares to mark the hundredth anniversary of the violence I don't know for the Washington Post newspaper reported that there are still unsolved questions about what happened to all those years ago\nI spoke to Tulsa city councilmember Vanessa how hard for wisdom behind at this investigation encouraged it before going into the pro she told me what we not what we know about what happened a hundred years ago\nObviously there was there was much racial tension in the community and there was a black man named Dick rolling\nWho worked in a hotel ... in downtown Tulsa the story goes that he was actually in a relationship with the white woman who also worked in a hotel in the elevator\nAnd they would sneak off from time to see each other and one day they were caught and the story goes that the white one then they say screamed right but in recent versions that that wasn't\nNecessarily the case that she didn't but at any rate the racist white to me to use that as an opportunity to destroy the black community the business community of black Wall Street this relationship is believed to be the cause of the new fancy dance which was which was a massacre\nAnd so the rampage began in Maine thirty one and Nineteen Twenty one what happens when the white mom descended on green what\nWill happen a massacre as what happened a rumor began that a mob would hang your ghrelin there was a group\nOf black men who were veterans of World War one who were armed who came back\nFrom war and knew how to protect themselves and so they went down to the courthouse and basically demanded that that he not be Hong later on they had to go back down there when they went back to the second time they were armed again this was because of the rumors are of the attempt to kill the growling\nAnd the white mop got angry that the black community even had weapons or that they would even dare to protect themselves or protect their community or protect growling and a white gentleman grabbed the gun of a black gentleman and the gun went off and that's when they say hell broke loose\nAnd they say over three hundred people were killed I think it's way over three hundred but we know that there were many many people who would never heard from again I guess historians or should I say white people\nWho wants to tell the story would like to believe that a lot of people just left and never return and I'm sure that's true in some cases\nBut not true and others and so that's why it's so important that as we come to understand and come to know where some of these grass mass graves are located that they'd be activated in that we honor them that we memorialize them but also to get a better sense of how many people\nWere actually loss was this something that was generally known until Sunday People talk over the years about the possibility that there could be mass graves after that rampage that there could be mass graves absolutely yes we absolutely\nKnew that there were inquiries network him in the community has certainly asked but it was left up to the ministry nation other city other at that time an impact administration they declined to do anything about it and they said no\nA lot of this is the old left buried and we want to uncover it\nThe truth is going to come out I Believe that they are still some people\nAlive that had something to do with what happened on address all night and so it's important to me because it's going to still allow the truth to come out allow some closure and most importantly to me it's going to honor our ancestors is going to honor those people\nWho who lost their lives are in a most horrific horrific way\nA difficult difficult parts of that city's history and an investigation into exactly what happened finally is going to happen according to the mayor it was interesting because when I said well we'll believe it\nUm at the national emergency infectious diseases rubber trees and at the U.S you're very recently you were deployed at any outbreak region close to the border between the D. R. C. and you've gone to now had what was your reaction to this incident were you surprised that people are still in denial um thank you for having\nMe I actually my initial experience than two thousand fourteen in the early on when I was at the border this time I didn't really go into the RCs I can speak from my experience in the last ... or\nThis is a scary disease right and I think at health care workers you must see that the the men's I'm\nAbout to care that we must take with a personal protective equipment with it but the isolation up as patients all of this tends to be quite alien and you're trying to convince people who are suffering from a disease that potentially is has a high mortality to lead their family members to be\nTaken away at a time when they'd rather spend the last moment with their family members and so I I think all of those are already\nDynamics that are in play to create trust and um\nI I think to act it out I think particularly in the are the are looking at an environment where there has been active conflict a long period of time you're asking people to come into care due to become stationary and and to give up that amount of trust you know to to outsiders wage which is I got to be hard to begin\nWith it's interesting though because I could understand that maybe in twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you say there was the outbreak and and places like Sierra Leone certainly own and people were still trying to come to terms with the fact that they cannot properly say goodbye\nTo a loved one who's died they can't touch them they can't bury them but the deer or see for example that had many Ebola outbreaks and in the past ... ... you would expect that and it's become part of the general knowledge that\nYou know that by now people know that it's so dangerous that you shouldn't be in contact with with the body of someone who's died of a bowler\nI I think that those are two very different community and you don't know if the people who are involved currently had that knowledge permeates through the communities right I mean if the knowledge is there it's not so much potentially a knowledge issue as much as there is a trust issue\nI mean think about climate change right at the same thing like you have so many people have the science and then I Believe that\nIt's the same thing here where they may have been hold it but it's in the end it it comes to a building long term Britain to those communities and and having those already in place before a crisis like this happens\nAnd I think um that's why you're sort of seeing that district and not and and I think these are communities like I said that has been affected by conflict for a long period of time that may not have that trust at baseline\nHow do you prepare there was a health worker um to to care for the patients are going through this area for the patience to go out to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash\nIt I Can't even imagine I can tell you just without in in the early on when I was taking care of patients it was hard to begin with because you're providing Karen is very strenuous situation that takes a lot of physiological reserve\nBut it also alter the kind of care that you can provide you know it alters the relationship you can develop that the patient because you're in these guards you know these personal protective equipment\nAnd then they add to all of that I think you're also acting\nIn a in a in an environment where you're worried for your own safety and I think patients can sense that rate and and and we do our best to make that connection and so all of those things combined in in addition to sort of\nUm having going into a community that you you have not care for the past is national healthcare workers training national healthcare workers and making them available and making giving them their resources is probably the best strategy in the future because\nThey have that connection you can kind of a community and that's why\nThe artsy had that's all I mean you can see the prior outbreak the one that happened in lake which are like they were so successful in controlling\nBecause of the existing network and relations have bigger outbreak that requires more outside forces\nNow head thank you so much with us and I had ... their medical director of special pathogens unit at the national emerging infectious diseases laboratories in the U.S [noise]\nNow ... is a disease which is to feel it take to get treatable but\nThe millions of women in Africa treatment is out of reach among for final reports from here to young where we've been affected that at the mercy of the disease him to those helping the struggling huge\nMy name is ...

and out came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle\nThat now I Know what you're talking about climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNo China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and I feel I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan\nTo get a false that feels good sunny\nStuff would look at the time frame\nBecause clearly Smith has well it could be draining until twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency does have that still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nAnother huge huge job ... on on how do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you know when you smoked and we'd be debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how ... states being built toughest new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper than gas\nAnd oil team competition with the do as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green it's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough to anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in our way that it's become he said I've been working environmentalists should for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you do that well because we have been producing country for so long\nAnd it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince kind of\nWhere to look on what are our options what all did renewables for example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you have to do so well you get tips or perhaps\nIf you're lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but the if not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of the ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they know how the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the soft or that's called at the new now they changed their name it's part of that strategy because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's talk with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is a long process and oil and gas industry is actually a part of it\nAnd the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the record more ...\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS into view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successful even ... yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers do this is one of the great things we could use our universe to do for the obvious from the burned see is like ... regions\nBig you construct them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere is a lot of things we have to do and we can do because we are in the situation we're\nCarry you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway ... effort political party actually ... let me just explain what we mean by that cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take a call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology except it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't know what are shifting government system quite all of a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and the staff has been focused on an alright for Twenty years I think that also and it's a challenge to politicians say with a greater chance because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nWe can spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do you think is a program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC do casual UK and you can subscribe to the podcast such the b._b._c. the real story ...\nThat season the unions because of if you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way that's the discussion above your work about where you live what you're going to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outside of your calls him now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase for two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with the local uh energy company here are the regional and we're actually looking at but together with the community is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits your own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we signed\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested in all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should sign certain ... certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for any technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house building we can do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and ships because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nThey're at because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration step have talked about there's only two developments in which the Arctic oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export ignored by you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we have sort of this other issues we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in terms so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which accounts\nFor other than oil actually we had developed an you we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can't government's\nFault no love this is a closer to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to a hundred degrees shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm I'm a great expansion Andy a matter of time sector or because they were picture if that's the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to how much you've made out there I Know but if you if it sounds like it doesn't Texas sometimes when I listen to it because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my\nThat is why I I truly believe that ... and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening in other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the speeds\nOf of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that when you have ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective than fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really need is at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is Jody grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas it's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas on all the gas on\nBoard ducked terminal comes from the barn she comes from her first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that region energies clean as some people might not see the reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave Palestine is trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new route surrounding North Pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn there and see they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of the\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe

well today and that's what I Would I get I deeply felt during my eating sorter but I was like oh it just it's just because like my head hurts or my stomach hurt because these are the things that most people express their comfort in like that's the language that we use\nStaff told me that even the words used prescribe eating disorders themselves didn't fail right\nThe Chinese translation of anorexia\nIt actually teaching food disorder I think it's just very misleading the way that\nOn its name in my particular case um I I Love food with like my whole entire heart like sued is life and so my eating disorder um developed it largely because I thought that if I could control myself in front of the things that I I really loved and\nUm I used to eat with like know that you know then I could
