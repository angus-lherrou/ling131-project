philosophy and my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool\nIs he says that I rebel therefore we exist\nAnd what he meant by that is if your rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel\nSo Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it and the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart a Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model\nFor fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said Americans sort of patriotism\nAnd so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens with the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a big duty for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter we're\nTalking about jobs you been talking about still we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and different sections of society in different countries the thing that strikes me is that all these icons of who seemed to be men where are the women can't women be cool to Carol\nYes they can I mentioned earlier the holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz are to as a jazz singer and she has to be seen as a female down in DC so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an exhibition is that in all aspects of their lives and uses clues and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of mind and the tea and and what that means for them\n[noise] okay so that's a a female who would I come and join us today what about him still new ah\n[noise] ah in filming a wire women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nAh they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film to our phone fatality is depicted as dangerous evil ... seen mostly in dark shadows at night [noise] okay\nSo what do you think about this idea that maybe the weather that comes with who seem to be mostly men\nIf you're talking about jazz musicians are Fillmore actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nThe tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to a school in a headline or as a description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the ban sonic youth from the eighties or nineties\nAnd since twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith Deborah Harry Chrissie Hi and\nAnd uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool and never really been associate with them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially and use it for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell I guess whatever we think of know what made as I say it did help cement the idea of the rebel who agree with you this was in voted in a new type of cool I come on the big screen looking and I'm thinking of Marlon Brando and James Dean who are quite different from the Nineteen forties so Noah heroes of Humphrey Bogart and Robert ...\n[noise] yes and movies Marlon Brando James Dean and also Montgomery cleft made rebellion attractive their style is disaffected a sensitive vulnerable and even plagued with self styled\nJames Dean was easy for why teenagers to identify with he became a superstar a legendary I kind of cool when he died in a car crash at age twenty four after having made just three films only one of which had been released east to beat him\nThe other two are rebel without a cause and giant were released after his death\nHis disaffected attitude struck a chord with young people worldwide\nWho saw on him their own unhappiness at growing up among hypocritical and narrow minded adults\nAnd this was during a time in the United states when being a non conformist was actually dangerous his was the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings in the Senate people were persecuted for their views this was a time of extreme racism segregation persisted in the south\nI'm homophobia massage any where at extreme levels and young people who are chafing against all kinds of restrictions um identified whole heartedly with James Dean and Marlon Brando\n... from the Nineteen fifty five so rebel without a cause with James Dean as the Occupy Cal teenager struggling with his parents\nWell we give you love and affection don't we pulled\nIn what is it was it because we wanted to that party well you know what kind of drunken brawl those kind of artist turn into a place for kids\nTo go you say you didn't care if they drink said mental dream\n\nYou know you'll say why do they have to say\nI just waited to have you know who he takes after\nJames Dean Jim ... I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re including this was a film at stake for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point had these with the new teenagers very much opposed wool phenomenon\n[noise] yes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time ah to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time\nFor perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city is after World War two people moved to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do there so you had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time\nHaving the luxury of a rebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nCount all the style that these films to fashion came to be seen as crucial to didn't they just want us to\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the world to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the the T shirt to white T shirt nice everyday object which started um [noise]\nAs part of a a naval uniform in around Nineteen sir teen but seeing on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire than warmed by James Dean and rebel without a cause this\nDreaming white T shirts under red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with a a pair of jeans say some things so radical\nOne of the other major figures from his parents we must have to get to him voted that rebels spirit was this thing at Elvis Presley [noise]\n\n\n[noise] Joe\nSo wedded Elvis fits into this pantheon of cool\nWell Elvis streets and in both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could grill plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando at the commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando was kind of a shock we'll be back\nBut the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first which were also heads on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charge he was doing something somewhat original with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he's often sort of seen as inappropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American beers at the time also enjoyed who's\nSinging and his take on the African tuition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rock is an energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop were\nThe impact people like James Dean into Elvis Presley on popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted except my idea of crude across the globe but I Wonder what you will see how we really talking about American cultural imperialism\nSupport for Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ...

you don't them recording surviving now have\nYou had any interaction with them yes admitting that they started cutting the pipes atrocities they started cutting your pipes yes so that was really

methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several X. but told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture\n... a lot of different players involved as you said it's a ... into the\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this bull whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water you can produce this way I said ultimately the real solution was working with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in the sun itself so that means\nWorking with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes they come by some people like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet of

wasn't something had a great deal of all ... wasn't necessarily picky well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to economy easel to ordinary people or whatever it was so it
