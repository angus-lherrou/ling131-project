boast about a hundred and Ninety billion dollars of assets on their management\nThat they had an presumably that's the game and money talks and with many people so many countries desperate for him investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this full point two billion a to lose ... pounds of of

though\nIf more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from turkey um if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome\nWould that change things was murder is always gruesome regardless of how to take space is um and I think uh the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping dripping information and then saying don't don't take this

creation of ISIS and we're still dealing with that I think it will be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not as soon as the extremists who wouldn't exploit this but she
