... times I have so you must be able to see you should be thinking about ... does well\nWhile so it's almost sort of contamination with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around it ...\nAs we grow older more and more of ourselves becomes innocence until a buddy is overwhelmed\nMost any do they make the cells around them aged ... these innocent sounds stop functioning as they should which is thought to be one of the things that lead to diseases like dimension cancer type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Harry's wants to know whether she could get these

you look through the microscope what were you expecting to say\nThat they would still my old south so they look kind of lacy under a microscope and we have a particular died that we can put on I felt coaches at times blue if that's an accent\nSo when I was expecting to say is that the south would be so blue and still looking old and I see what they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking at young south to professor Harry said oh no you've got the wrong side oh these are young sales go through it again and that and she did\nShe did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she brought them back to me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... scientists and yeah they were taught to basically throw rocks that you're right there

planning to follow up for the me too era of Hollywood needs no reminding of goes to the allegations faced by film producer Harvey Weinstein allegations he denies\nThe BBC's Moffat county has been discussing these issues with Jane Fonda she began by\nAsking how she first got the idea for the film nine to five which also stars Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton\nOne of my friends was an organizer of women office workers\nShe would tell me stories about the kinds of things that they were facing and they had to put up with and finally one day I said I Want to make a movie about this and then was my idea to cast ... how much convincing did they take to take a year\nTo convince ... to be in a movie which is pretty amazing given that nobody ever had Dolly at a movie before\nLooking back on the film do you think it stood the test of time\nAbsolutely the issue with me too movement which began just about a year ago is very much front and center and of course nine to five very much dealt with the issues of\nSexual abuse but not just that also the fact that the character played by Lily Tomlin would train young men and they would be promoted past her and the salary differential those dealt with\nPlenty of material and when it comes to making a seat for which you're looking into it\nYeah well it's different now in a way it's worse the sexual harassment still exist\nThe men being promoted past women still exists but now many of the workers will be subcontracted which means that where do they go when their wages stolen by their boss where did they go if they're fired because they're

did that present personal dynasty you about whether to speak house who knows\nNo I've never had too many difficulties speaking out\nWhat was important for me me too was the survivor's coming forward and telling their stories and being believed\nThe time's up movement is now what do we go to do about it like having more women on boards of directors having women and more positions of power but right at the beginning of time's up we in Hollywood received a\nA wonderful letter from seven hundred thousand women farm workers you know it was really dear sisters we understand what you are talking about and rising up about we deal with it every day in the fields\nAnd it was a transformative moment and a lot of us realize that if the time's up movement is going to be successful in the long run we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters that are less visible it's even harder for them to speak up because they will definitely lose their jobs\nI had to read that do you yourself have known some of the allegations about hobbies ... cats but hadn't spoken out about\nWell no you can't it's the survivor that has to speak because this was before it became public\nThat Roseanne I told her experience and the experience of other women as well and but she was too scared to come forward but she knew that it had affected her career that she had rebuffed him but I I couldn't override her and speak\nDo you think that the whole controversy around Brett Kavanaugh and his appointment as the Supreme Court justice do you think that that can be seen in the context of the me too movement in the sense that Christine Blasey Ford has south was willing to come forward and speak about it\nWell Anita Hill came forward and spoke about it before there was a me too movement in fact African American women had been coming forward and speaking about this long before white famous white women in Hollywood have been doing so but I I think\nThe behavior of the old white men on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd how they were too scared to question her blessing for directly for fear of appearing away Joe Biden and others who question during the Clarence Thomas hearings\nSo they hired a woman lawyer\nTo do it you know that's a cop out we're cowards\nThat is because of me too they knew they had to be a very very careful and so they were careful for a while and then of course Trump\nInsulted

the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances to make sure that what the people choose doesn't churn

if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and grabbing new bunch if necessary

changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things more psi phi end of things where you got these machines are looked like washing machines with friends in the midst of carbon out of the year\nThey can do that right now the cost about six hundred dollars a ton of harm that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we thinking about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they've philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove comic mountains there why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers the politicians and campaign as an environmental is really worried about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat if you're driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo what extent is carbon capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nYeah are there are lots of different things going on at the moment every country in the world is planting trees for most people are trying to change the way that they do far a station that the\n... lengthen the time ... tons of trees grow or they changed you know when you have a massive kilometer you fire or something that we've gone very quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of poultry on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice was literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that course all these big bits of kissed cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put her hand in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report has come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those there remain using source of our thing for economy soak up more common than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton per common and that is really really cheap the bigger problem costs long terms we don't have enough of them you know the find the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the games are making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller effect is happening on his jeep about this report things we do more but how\nDo you incentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking all these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that also obviously building muscle coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief amongst richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it\nThen there'll be able to either share that technology with India and China [noise] nothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all the the big challenges with China and India they remain on solve at this point\nAnd do
