that disproportionately affect blacks than to ... to the white man\nBecause of the ... the a couple of reasons one\nI'm a a name so uh in Georgia a there are our in America period that there are a common name\nThat are at an ethnic minorities have and um you know for example there are five dollars and the river choke on dialysis and the state of Georgia\nAnd only one of them is eligible to vote a say because they are a U.S citizen or because they are because she is\nA you know currently incarcerated or because of the exact ... them they don't match 'em all the data information so I'm One person was ineligible ah we'll get flagged in a system and other people with that name\nCould also be flag on the other reason is that um people of color are more likely to be registered to vote via a voter registration drive out and we tend to vote or register people to vote\nOn paper for 'em and a guy\nAnd then say other than that we also understand that they've been sending incidents with say a busload of blacks Kenyans one table to to continue when they were about to to have you also made even during\nThat time so I'm a week ago or in a rural part of Georgia there were about forty black senior citizens who were had it on a bus to go register to vote and they were all ordered off the bus\nA because there were complaints that I'm the boss was organized or the voting trick was organized by one of the political parties and there's no law in Georgia that prevents seniors or people period from\nParticipating and I'm a voter or a bus driver to go vote but a wider person took it upon themselves\nTo order the seniors off of the vote and and unfortunately I'm a we have seen these type of suppression tactics 'em all over the state of Georgia\nAnd we believe that it starts bonds and energy and enthusiasm that we've seen for people of color were interested in participating in the mid term election\nWomen say thank you very much for telling us about the ... the New Georgia project

that were new to it you know the euphoric high of a moment to two dozen living with sort of celebrated the world around and I think part of the problem was that people saw that as the finish line on the south Sudanese project\nThis kind of unprecedented experiment and international state building and moved on rather than at the beginning of that project\nWhich will be the international community particularly so much the south Sudanese maybe you will\nBoth so I think I think national and international monitors have some soul searching to do about this but yeah I think South Sudan has an unprecedented coalition of support both among the Africans in the region but also among the wider world not least in the west among European countries in the United states\nIn the book you made the argument that America sometimes described as the midwife for South Sudan's independence go too close to the south Sudanese to the people who grew to 'bout freedom as the south Sudanese source why what was the problem\nYeah I Do think the United states in particular play to an absolutely critical role huge role in in helping deliver that independence and that is a real achievement but I think\nUltimately overtime that on critical embrace an unqualified belief in a righteousness a cause ultimately blinded some of South Sudan's and the ... supporters to the flaws of booze chosen heroes and I think ultimately bad most\nWarped the political space in South Sudan and it reinforces dynamic in which the south Sudanese elites we're increasingly answer too and we're a derive their legitimacy from abroad rather than from their own people\nThe dynamic is really different now if you look at the way American politicians leaders talk about South Sudan this little support now as a matter of going too far away but come to disengaged\nYeah I think we swung too far at this stage there isn't a lot of concern there's a lot of interest about this in the Trump Administration and I think we see that playing out on a day to day basis now where the United states is to absent from the scene\nYou'll say critical says the south Sudanese leadership salvage it was the accidental

Tillerson know took Leno to invite you to sit with the cool kids though a China envy in two states are the two biggest economies in the world are you going to talk about global trade with them I'm curious what missile I spoke to independent research just Stephanie half and\nI asked to what exactly needs reforming the WTO\nThere's three main plane so that first as they want to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the monitoring system\nSo you've got a hundred and sixty four countries around the world all trading together too difficult to keep an eye on what's happening now right everything's technical now and that brings us into the second point which is they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade\nTo international investment to state owned enterprises that's code for China by the way\nAnd the third thing is that they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute supplement system to right now it really tedious\nLengthy and inefficient to try to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started this summer and it's not great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members of all of them\nAre movies people that are meeting in Canada obviously we're trying to in the United states not being invited the world's two largest economies so how's that going to work it\nSounds like a disaster and not happen there but at the same time I might be really inefficient to happen there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joined in Canada for this today jammed brave ideas come up with some solutions and then present them to the to feeding parties as look\nThis is a nice basis for discussion what do you think what do you like and it really takes something on the disposition and personality and grits and insurance of the people who are committed to multilateral trade to keep doing that I mean not this diplomacy this is state craft\nAnd this is stuff that Canada frankly it's very good at right in the European Union is very good at it the United states used to be very good at it under US President Donald Trump we've seen him on to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement\nWhich he has recently done and he took that right to the wire he's pulled out

for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states has a victim China\nSimilarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade

doesn't shape hop and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges might who who do all of the education so that

migrants heading from central\nAmerica tools the U. S. they reach Mexico now getting numbers in attracting political controversy as they go the size of the group is growing from around a thousand to more than seven thousand according to the United nations estimates\nPresident Trump has turned the caravan into a major domestic us political issue to accusing the migrants have been criminals among other things\nFor their part the migrants said many of them are parents with young children seeking a better life away from the violence and the lack of a community and in their home countries one of those in the Taliban is twenty nine year old who said gun is at my ten year from Honduras he's been speaking to news day about why he's on the move\n[noise]\nI'm twenty nine years old and smoke for me it's been\nThree years but I was a job it's ... it's a sacrifice and sometimes I didn't have money to get tiny foods I'm truly scared if I'm honest I'm afraid because this journey is not easy for me this is the first time leaving 'em ... fear but one I remember the necessity of we have\nNot just forces me to continue\nAnd even if I Would like to go back I don't know because of the retaliation the Honduran government has promised us thing with anyone who returns to Honduras risks jail for it up to four years no that isn't my fear my fear to starving to death that's my fear\nThe only thing I Hope is that Mr Donald Trump opens the doors to us that sense because it's been too much sacrifice to get there an end up with nothing we're not going to steal from him we're not going to do anything it would be white God's Grace but he can help us\nThat's a Jose ... well I took him to Daniel ... a reporter for the political news site in the U.S and I asked him how he told President Trump would react if he could who is your story\nI guess I Would say that the president he makes the case then you can't\nBe allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border now than when is it going up and so I think you know Trump he was elected\nPrimarily or in some cases a on a anti immigrant platform in twenty sixteen and so he's carrying out his\nPhoto promise to stop illegal so that we should have a heart policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of showing clearly clean desperate situation\nThat source of a policy line his rhetoric and so on and clearly plays very well to his base with these midterm elections approaching sauce do you think it works with the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nI think a lot of moderate voters they don't like when Trump uses false statements to back them self up when he was talking about you know unknown and middle Easterners you know we in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans\nOr moderates they don't want to use this type of\nYou know racially motivated\nFear mongering that is not even true no\nI think it says to his small sliver of his base which is still up thirty percent of Americans but for Democrats for independence\nFor even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan or immigration policy in general may or do not approve about they don't want immigration policies to run out of\nThe country by a Steven Miller who is very hard right anti immigrant a senior policy adviser to\nPresident Trump is also coolest a Democrat ... tried to pin the blame as they were on the Democrats easier topic than the Democrats than just simply trying to avoid in the run up to the midterms or conversely I wanted to kind of ... most possibly\nHelp them in the sense that it might motivate that base perhaps evening courage Hispanic votes is to come out and vote for them\nThat's a great point I think\nDemocrats that don't want to be talking about this issue because no political party has a great answer to immigration\nPolicy you know we've both presidents of Democrats and Republicans may have tried to tackle immigration reform and they've been stopped a in various efforts and some Democrats want to be talking about health care and economy\nAnd Trump's character a and investigating the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but really this effort to split the tree and cheap I trumped in terms of feeling that this is a democratic caravan when\nA these types of ... I've been happening for the last couple of decades has\nDaniel Lipman was the political a news sites\nAs a lot of coverage and this uh on the BBC Web sites are being used to call me cleaning a video made by a correspondence highly ... bull that Trump and the facts about the migrants caravan sort of fat check facts check some of the things Donald Trump has been saying about those thousands of people making their way up to the U.S\nAnd that's in the U.S are us and Canada page um BBC and use a BBC dot com forward slash knees at full so stay tuned and coming up in the second half of this hour we're going to Canada because after days of legalizing\nMarijuana it's reportedly running out of the drum\nThe fighting has never properly stopped since then despite various piece tales one recent study suggested nearly four hundred thousand people have died jak button is a former U.S diplomat who played a key role in the peace talks off to the civil war began\nWhich he describes in his new book away from the sky the making an on making of the world's newest state about South Sudan struggles I asked him what went wrong\nTicket stunned many people both close observers an folks that were new to it you know the euphoric high of that moment or two dozen living will sort of celebrated the world around and I think part of the problem was that people saw that as the finish line of the south Sudanese project this kind of unprecedented experiment\nAnd international state building and moved on rather than at the beginning of that project\nIn the book you make the argument that America sometimes described as the midwife for South Sudan's independence go too close to the south Sudanese to the people who go to 'bout freedom as the south Sudanese source why what was the problem\nYeah I Do think the United states in particular play to an absolutely critical role a huge role in in helping deliver that independence and that is a real achievement but I think\nUltimately overtime that on critical embrace an unqualified belief in a righteousness of the cause ultimately blinded some of South Sudan's and the SP alum supporters to the flaws of those chosen heroes and I think ultimately that both\nWarped the political space in South Sudan and it reinforces dynamic in which the south Sudanese elites we're increasingly answer too and we're a derive their legitimacy from abroad rather than from their own people\nThe dynamic is really different now if you look at the way American politicians leaders talk about South Sudan there's little support now's America gone too far away because to disengaged\nYeah I think we've swung too far at this stage there isn't a lot of concern there is a lot of interest about this in the Trump Administration and I think we see that playing out on a day to day basis now where the United states is a two absent from the scene\nYou'll say critical says the south Sudanese leadership solve a kid was the accidental president and you'll woods uh nobody complimentary there by ... the main rebel leader they signed a peace agreement now are they going to have to work together again it's failed Seventy times in the past ten they work together now\nThe million dollar question look I have my doubts\nAnd I had you know I was part of the mediation that helped broker the first peace agreement with alternately failed to produce a a real political transition in South Sudan and I have some of the same doubts now that I did them I think we need to think in five and ten and Fifteen year terms and for me that means partnering with youth in South Sudan and means partnering with\nThe thirty something a little tired of politics should be ... the army\nTotally locked out of politics and have been for too long waiting generational change in their own country I Do have optimism about South Sudan and it's in many ways tied to that generation and so I think the Trump Administration I think western governments are think outsiders would generally do well those to address the immediate term but to start to invest and partnering with a new generation and South Sudan\nIt'll you'll dealings ways not governing elites who came from or a bad idea and you ended up as politicians despite themselves in some cases [noise] did you get much feeding that they wanted the best for that country that I prepared to go to be on their own interest in a work in the national interest\nI Do think many of them some of them did have the best intentions of their country at heart but they failed to seize this incredible opportunity they had both apple\nOil reserves of oil reserves that many states would kill for and they had a remarkable reservoir of international goodwill and so they had a real opportunity and I think because of that history because of they were in many ways disconnected from their own population because institutions went there and there was opportunity for corruption sadly I think they failed in that\nIn season that opportunity I think some of them are repentance some of them have seen what's happened as a result of those failures others I think or not and\nThat in many ways is why I think generational change is the\nFundamental ingredient in a long term transition to a piece in South Sudan\nGenerational change ate fatty critical of the south Sudanese leaders president Salva Kiir the rebel leader wrecked my

Ireland and the Irish republican will not have a hard border between them that\nGuarantee offered by the British as long as you'd always last December it now seems has been taken off the table because Theresa May ... get hit by the ... allies in the Democratic union is poverty that\nUh I think you'll ruin them is ah I didn't think that um she's a day being ducking leaving I think a great quality is that the reason I is a unflappable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt\nThat every waking day the poor prime minister takes a lot of incoming fire for many angles are mostly from those who want to they're a heartbreak so breakfast donate deal a tool\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing is she is saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom the full countries in the u._k. must be held together and that the police traces behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United

... square if I may interrupt us to talk of Irish foreign minister Simon ... said yesterday they will be no withdrawal agreement without the Irish and ... ... and ... story so all of this\nShuffling of papers and on different positions for different people in the end it's quite simple\nTheresa May's here but your position is hit the brakes tears who appear to have a a means to stop threes and made from from making any more concessions to Brussels base it over here there is no way of making this work\nI think that will be a way and actually wants to analyze it I'm Simon cave and he's very

existential string friendships between colleagues have been irreparably damaged\nBecause all these bitter arguments\nOver bricks that language has become toxic including talking from breakfast tears of killing his own is for the prime minister carrying on new since we're meeting so she could hang on a cell phone nice being found in her body want to know is going on inside your party\nI I think briefings using disgusting language like that and just to be condemned today I quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum than is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party giving the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now open Brexit cannot possibly deliver a cut hair in Britain deal\nActually I think it can because I think that in the next few weeks is the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all is will will change and we will have a vote in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal and I think\nWhen I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me it can get through the British Parliament but it won't have the support surely up some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off something members at least of the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll peel off a lot of those who are making noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the ... the deal to tell them to\nTake a new ... check has all of a sort of Italy which\nIs a that is my belief and I think we should then supported\nI don't see how your policy can survive that your former boss well yeah it's

each other even before this ... deal is put back on the table before parliament as the final deal with the Europe your party's\nFinish that because that that policy as it was bigger than the events that has to cope with in the case of Boris things as much a journalist as he is a politician says sometimes he uses this Florence language and what was happening was that he was really intending to go into ... and ... with a wish to undermine\nThe prime minister race you are listening after finishing off and\nOn that for all if you you can solve rubbish authorities back a bar is in order to try and just getting to back off I had to come in and actually that is what happened and I think the prime minister uh we'll be able to deliver this I think talk a bite people challenging a much exaggerated\nFinal four if you are wrong if parliament rejects the deal that three of them may brings back\nFor you want the best option then it a change of leader in the ... on a different kind of bill is it a general election or is it A People's are so called people for another referendum on Britain's relationship with the Europe including the possibility we actually staying after all\nWhat I think you know to have a what they call the people say you need to act upon them to make it possible and that ain't going to happen at the moment but I think that if a deal with put to parliament and that we're we're January's that wood coals followed race or on seventeenth anything we've been discussing today\nSo we basically have no idea what would\nIt would be we'd be getting it's a completely on that into energy is that what happened and that's why I wanted to happen which as well as I as one of the older members of parliament\nAppeal to my coffee to stick together or to stop I'm having a guy that the prime minister all the time and to realize that you know if we get all this world and we might end up with the ... oval pull off a lay the government led by Germany cold than which is like having Fidel Castro ... Downing Street\nWas\nOn his arm of it for for people to forty one thousand them from Texas so it's more than a match for the\nSpecial interests and the politics as usual we're lucky\nWhen Michael Whitney is the newsletter an editor and emails such a gift that online news publication the intercept he served as a digital fundraising manager for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign in twenty sixteen he says overall strategy is really resonating with small scale bonus if given an average of just forty seven dollars each\nBarrel work is doing something that seems obvious but that a lot of political candidates won't do which is rejecting money from corporate political action committees\nHe's saying that his campaign is only going to be funded by contributions from individuals and that if she can win his election it will only be because of individuals' making contributions\nTo hang on a second that you're saying that he's actually raised more money by saying he will not take any money from the corporate sector\nHe'll take money from people who worked for corporations but she won't have any of their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate tax got him there\nAnd that kind of an appeal is very compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help them when\nDoes this reflect Ben cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWatch Beto O'Rourke and other candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government backed is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better or work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just click and and make a quick their nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or work is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawn facts are official intake points for people to come and volunteer\nAnd help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly send a big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run a campaign very differently\nThan anyone else has thought possible and I think the true test of better works legacy will be how different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approached by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital expenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last\nCycle federal ... because his car he losing going to the opinion polls by a percentage points also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment and infuse he asked them to think the polls around\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in excess of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out to voters that are not being picked up in the polls Ken you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Ninety point seven W.

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nTo journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney I'm watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping the majority or losing it but despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at them and\nGet out and vote in the mid term [noise]\nWhat do I am proud to ensure news are forty minutes president here of our country Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major assets Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one\nAnd anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been best has stopped from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over oil may end up being fairly even so like all of this translate into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump after all under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research in recent years just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential and so I just\nSo how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government illegal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to tie advertisements and to find all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you cannot advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much uh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race\nAnd you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend that last you know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to regret regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things but campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive\nThe words of French ... check Andy math edition of witness for me ...\nYou're listening to the b._b._c. world therapists and here's what's happening in the studio this week\nAn

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nAccess my mind I was like okay that's what you didn't do ... shot so I can see a little bit different strikes okay does need to wash rational\nWell I've been talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developers solves the brain training A.Q Khan who's findings wicked in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage that has some of them get several stream they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even leave their own house because they worry that anything they touch\nWell you know a contaminate them\nI'm walked treatments currently exist\nSo there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and that's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention\nWhen that therapy they ask psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you\nGo and wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there are right there is nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment as the selective serotonin ... taken him a disease the drugs\nThat I used also in the treatment of depression the ss arise drugs like Prozac but again I'm about forty percent of patients uh don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training out is more affected was the thinking behind is\nWell the thinking behind it was that festival also when you have to do the CBP therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital I have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment\nAnd that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments and the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on the therapies for that at the society an academy and medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of an explosion response prevention on the app itself so there were two different types of happened both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to to reflect if you like on their behavior\nYes so they they really when they look at the apps to some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that I've touched something I just can look at the uh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBP therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or use a cloth twice they used to have to throw it away if I was wiping accounted but now I realize that actually there's nothing nothing wrong with using it twice renting it out or when I catch up and I don't need to rush away and wash my hands\nSo what sort of has have you had with those using this some brain training camp\nSo we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive symptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent so that was a good reduction because they've only use the F for one week stuff they used it for longer it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a\nCognitive ability so they're not so rigid in their cognitive thinking anymore they're not something that you all they can sort of think of more about goals that they want to achieve rather than these rituals and their obsessive thoughts\nOf as a

a an and conduct\nAnd military a maritime exercises and joint drills so I think this is just that an opportune time where they've all parties have seen that there is a necessity to have some sort of
