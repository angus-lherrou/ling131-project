and yet the lines were still there\nYes that's a good point um lions are very resilient species generally about where now at a tipping point for their species so unless we act now there are species will continue to decline and so that's why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful because we are at\nThat tipping point the actions we take now will determine the future of the

'cause I'm not in the U.S but the old some someone winning considerably better\nI think it's pretty likely someone will win well or or possibly many people will when depending on how the of the numbers wall\nWould it technically be possible to by so many tickets that you would guarantee yourself a victory\nIn principle you could buy all possible combinations but in practice it's impossible there are\nThree hundred million combinations and the tickets cost two dollars each so if you had six hundred million dollars that's the first obstacle and then uh you wouldn't be may be willing to invest it in the lottery and win over a billion dollars\nBut the trick of courses you're not guaranteed that you'll be the\nOnly winning tickets so you're jackpot might be cut in half instantly or even further if there's multiple winners and I spent some time to share logistics\nOf buying that many tickets I'm going to be easy\nTo absolutely not or if you do a back of the envelope kind of calculation or you will find that\nEven if you have somebody going out of all possible numbers in a certain range\nAbout one kitchen every\nTen seconds you might have one person might be able to fill out about ten thousand tickets between now and win the\nLottery is wrong but you need to fill out three hundred million so you're going to need to hire a thirty thousand people and the tape that old but I Want to share with my ... greedy I Would imagine that they're all going to expect a share maybe they could do a little uh\n... you know if you get the the winning ticket like a far away and the chocolate factory you might be the one who gets it ensures oh I'm probably not going to win this last round my\nI I Would say that's the safest bet I know and in fact I Would say that no one listening to this program is likely to win the lottery I Know the BBC has lots of listeners but I'm going to go out on a limb if you're listening to this program and you win the lottery called me up and proving I'm wrong\nYou know what color I stop and frisk fitness right and that's going to stop and she had the money that's what I was thinking you know exactly because you know from point six\nBillion dollars to get a little bit over a billion I think he said in a little bit of ... [laughter] not at my he said he got you got to buy a ticket say you know statistically things as much off but he's not feelings on it might not like maybe there is that what they see us having\nThere was no particular thing [laughter] you know can get one of\nThose famous city it was just out of the American singer Katy Perry song is cool kids to go and that was done in two thousand and eight and I was looking to move some production views on the video cleaned and by then we can sing or how would you say you work has changed in that time\nI mean if you compare the two videos of very very different I Would say that it is also were two very very different artists and inevitably when you're working on a project and collaborating with a novice no doubt you're putting your on ... on a project is just no way to not do that because\nEverything you do with what he meant intuition and you'll making choices that no doubt we'll bring in a little bit of king about his flavor to project however I always really tried to not\nLet that person will stop or to take an artist and I think for me Aurora and Katie could not be more different [laughter] thing that you\nDidn't want to put your personal ... that's what I noticed I just wanted to do so you can recognize easy that is it can cause a product\nYou know and it's it's funny because there was a real fashioned about five years ago where all these trucks to start putting names on projects and I always felt really uncomfortable about that which probably was\nNot really the best thing to do for my career but I just felt like oh this is not a pessimist about if this is an ... for the artist if anything suit can we can say that the\nCommon theme is about how women want to come across these videos ... you're listening to how they want to be perceived\nWell absolutely you know when you're working with an audit asked us thinking about festival what does it mean to them what is it about you know also you walk away and you listen to the ... see how you interpret it because sometimes there really are ... I don't always have to\nFall or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if that has to say that they want to show in the video and I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny I'd like to me somehow either from page to final productive what are your technique\nSo you know they gave me this song I go back I can listen to a song and you meet in east matches on pictures in my head like I just like the same and I just have to reduce the gather and sometimes it takes me a long time I got to\nYou know please don't when I'm washing my team of adequate when I'm cooking when I'm drinking from why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to stay away from is\nThinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she would come to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I Do get up and I write it all down but then I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I tried to make it as a visual as possible\nIn words and then I found it to them and hundreds if another hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] really a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that that's what it is I shouldn't have to ask you about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point the liberal shocked that has come in in in my career based off\nPresidents of course you get the point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because obviously deposit I'm a business person\nSecond to last Clinton wasn't but we're not pitching while cutting that idea very passionate about it I can see I can teach that I can feel it I Do everything from but when you look the just you're going to win the ... the entire\nVision is once you do have to show up and you'll boxes [laughter] you know\nLet me let me I'm kinda\nI'm Jimmy talks about repeat to listening so the songs over and over again she's brushing my teeth and just drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore um\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening practice until you just can't you know it's ... you know I almost like you know you don't even Hitler it's anymore you just feel it [noise]\n\nIt's good to just sit with that you know if you can't the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like can you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market or maybe I'm just not as popular over the director kept me but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging and ours I recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... world pitching on that project and\nI knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in that ... busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to\nHer I just have to come up with an idea and like heart for the best you know I didn't quite know at that time but that's the part of being a doctor is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success show but maybe it's being a director and\nPitching on American artists and you ... out of it can potentially be a bit more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIt's the biggest skill you if you're fishing will be on the ... project that's a that's a larger scale I mean yeah I had the opportunity to working of course with some amazing artist but then I think I'm looking at the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then again it's not genes you'll be on say\nYou're listening to the conversation is supposed to be rude winning music video direct ... from Australia and Kenny ... from Nigeria\nSo you Bruce operating at a level where many of the artist you worked with on a huge big names and know exactly what you want to think can be a specific examples where you've had to navigate accommodating to sit and listen holding on to create a vision and I knew him and you say that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been\nCertain points for somebody wanting something a little bit differently so it just does yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't that way because I mean I have to put myself as being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps doing medical male dominated field um\nSupport for Ninety points of a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children has been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity to knock it out to park the first ever project that I did well official project and I did music video and with the music video for an award or many at I was\nOne of them and they had a a song that was going to be the theme song and then they had a lot of the big\nNames pitching for it and I'm like you know I Do not like you know I'm directing out again and again we want you to get when you come out of the stage and things like that and I mean I'm not just one thing they had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be a visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know was running the show\nAnd he called me like I was like actually love this treatment and bite off you are like that and I caught that one and I needed to make a decision about what you're going to get you know what how about you do that\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to get into this project and you get a better job because of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point that got that Johnson eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't heritage that I knocked it off the part I might not have gotten no more boosted tuition but that is the only project and I have to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card you know a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because it's just the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're charging [laughter]\nI'm very expensive very kinds of you know they have to say yeah you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging us and it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging a debt ... their partners like I'll give you figured that projects do that I Do\nFor nothing at all but that would lead me the most money when they came to me my budget with a little bit too much for them I really love the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in that particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time when I was probably made me the most money down the line because people are seeing that and gone I needed to work in this project right\nIt's an effort you're going to be given today I mean what they can get ... now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she or challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased\nBecause that as a rule of thumb that older actor get ten percent of the budget is what would be is typical budget I mean can

I can I Can't predict and that's getting today that's nothing I can wait for the medication to run at the moment\nIn those situations even if you go the shoes and hibachi calm move calm put them on and she says era of limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven set aside the golf all that kinda fits in Haiti place and that they said this is flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that I imagine a calm the very easy to see delays is on a sunny day\nYeah mounted mentioned to me that when she goes and will do in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she ... lasers on south is one of the drawbacks and she felt or independent or not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible outdoors\nSo it's not passing solutions from out but it helps or do we know how well they swept for other people with Parkinson's\n... study was done and it showed that the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants off medication and when they were on medication the effect which do positive it as a decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent\nHowever that was a really small sample size only Nineteen participants in our study\nAnd that's no and I wonder how do this you know do they make you send out a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in

solutions are reaching a real wild ... quicker\nPreviously they would have been but among the lab for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of start ups and you're a scientist and professors and you're assigned to show up and speaking to you have said that it's very likely we're going to see more of these connoisseur nations in the future [noise]\n\nAnd this fascinating thank you I'm a and things to all of you for listening to all tax\nIf you want to see those lazy she's an action go to our Facebook page we've made a video about them and if you want to get in touch the email is world hats as BBC does seal the u._k. we'll be back next week with another mind bending solution to get your head around until then the by\nThe victims and survivors of these of this shooting were high school students who knew very smartly how to use social media and how to kind of leverage their pain and their fear\nInto politics very quickly and there were a few dozen companies that were offering discounts to enter a members\nLot of them are household names you had a rental car companies and I'm sure people use all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all those companies for trans parents say the public deserves to now which companies are\nSupporting the gun lobby and I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a.\nIn that week after the Parkland shooting very quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly hold their relationships with the IRA which was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to say that\nYou could chip away at some of the ... tower\nDid we see and he was a major retailers pulling back from the sale of firearms for example\nThere are a number of major sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer\nSell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts all but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these movies\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact and the ... finances\nWe know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents about it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting facts that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections\nThey are spending far less on candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the NO right was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its
