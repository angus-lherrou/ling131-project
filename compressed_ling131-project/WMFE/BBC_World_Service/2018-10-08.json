were heading for something rather comma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually war\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warning of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... rage with scale full wins the Atlantic Clinton expect Kevin read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key

have an event that is occurring and that we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability ever trends right now is is one and we're trying

um and what is that it was found to have taken in as much as they got it from her mother straight off the bus in Nineteen sixty nine he was found to have foolish got busted for it and was found to have given her to another couple as a gift\nBut the court also just so I did that too much time had pasta actually convict him that the statute of limitations in this case only extended to ten years after the child in his turned Eighteen and of course this was some forty nine years ago now so does that a walked free\nWe spoke to and it's often the verdict she had mixed feelings about it she told us that she would appeal the verdict but that she was happy the trees had been officially established him I think\nThere'll be ... when the one that I feel good because the Spanish court has said yes maybe have ... in Spain and it was sent that mother wasn't lying she always told the truth\nI didn't mind that he's not going to jail it's not a nice Templeton thing but he can't leave the house people will recognize him and everyone knows who the gate\nAnd he's condemned anyway now the second phase stop getting to the Supreme Court and let's see what they decide on the statute of limitations\nReaction there in a month for the gal Lacey one woman one smashed baby them one doctor in this case but this has always so to go much much wider bought his reaction bringing women around the country have their babies taken away\nYes exactly this is a case between one doctor and one woman who he helps deliver forty nine years ago but it's been watched across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting innocence history this is about opening up a really difficult chance of Spain's past at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of Spain's history\nAccording to the campaign has had perhaps tens of thousands of mothers had that baby stolen in the post war years\nLike in his his mother by medical stuff for members of the Catholic Church mostly because they were judged unfit to raise that children either they were seen as political opponents opposed to general Franco's dictatorship\nOr in later years just because they were on marriage or seen the judge to pool\nLater on in the Nineteen seventies and eighties compared to say it said it became a master of trafficking the children some money\nBut this is the first trial of anyone actually involved in those alleged practices and there's a small group of mothers outside cool today wasting for this or that some of them said they were angry that because I had walked free free without any punishment one described as a slap in the face\nBut there were others that were happy the state headed knowledge this for the very first time\nWe spoke to one mother power to an end as whose baby was taken away by a nun in Nineteen Seventy four before pilot could even give us the stolen child name she told me or even learn it's gender\nImmediately after the but she said she was injected with a drug that left to unconscious the following day ... the baby had died\nWhen Paolo demanded to know what happened the doctor said it was an act of gold when she also the the puppy she was told it had already been beret forty four years later talking to us she still cries episodes of the child she never got a chance to hold\nThat I knew that but when I got down if you're going to get thrown\nAround on the day if you will have to stay I write to them I say you and nine months in my family and I left jeans the five second rule ... bought it I've got you as I say we face child but I was in front of an associate entertain him\nLots Paulos story a Lucy or just one story one case will it be more\nI think that's the first thing people are waiting for now is to see what Spain Supreme Court makes if this appeal and what they say about the legal time limit for trials of this kind that's always going to affect\nUm how many trials are approaching the future that has been ... complaints we understand but a lot of them are very difficult to follow up because it's so difficult decades later to find the evidence that prosecutors need to really bring a solid case\nI mean it up to the vet himself is believed to have destroyed evidence releasing to the case he was tried and of course many of those involved are now very elderly\nAnd it says adopted mother in fact confessed the situation to her before she died but because because she was handed and it says a baby a mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was\n... is the man who can tell how but despite this land mock trial in is it still closer to finding out who had the mother is or even if she said alive\nLucy thanks very much the BBC's Lucy Williams and back in Madrid and if you go to the BBC website BBC don't come forward slash news and you look on the the stolen babies story you can see the video of a catch ... confronting dumped Eduardo valid there from her assignment program from a few years ago\nTo stay with us here on the program we'll be looking at the new climate change report in the second half and but also be hearing a conversation\nThat the are missing Saudi journalist your mouth how shall we had with my colleague Julian marshals just a few days before he disappeared you're listening to news out\nIn the United states at least ... people understand that climate change is happening I Know the president is out of touch with that but the American public understands it\nThe real problem that we have is that people are seeing it as a faraway problem or a problem that impacts the coastlines are maybe those forested areas that are going on fire in California and the west but\nFrankly you know climate change changes everything it really is the biggest threat that we have to public health today to our safety you know to uh wellbeing to our economy's to jobs this is about national security as well and people need to understand and personalize it\nAnd if you look at American it's not monolithic picture of it as you say the the White House the current administration Seventy takes a different views the administration usa but if you're looking at Twenty one states say they still signed up to the Paris Agreement many cities many local ministry rations bought\nWithout central government providing a lead how much difference cannot make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell you I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down then not following the science and not following the law they're trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's a longer term signal that you want to send\nYou know this isn't to short term problem\nThis is this is a challenge where we have the solutions today\nWhich is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act because in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector but it's a long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about marriage job's on yeah it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs are on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nWell you probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuels sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line\nBut this administration doesn't understand about the jobs are the future versus trying to make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change their carbon footprint is the type of comedy Dr Americans love cause and it's in it's proved very difficult to get Americans to change that habit\nWe had to actually regulate not to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicles that Americans actually wanted to buy\nWhich is one of the reasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued then we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy and they're saving consumers money as a result if you want to revert to really expensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pomp and it also doesn't save lives\nBy cleaning up our air pollution today in addressing the challenge of climate change for\nAll of us we talk about saving lives look at some of the the extreme weather that America's seems to be having to deal with more and more I mean is that having an impact do things on the white people look at the climate\nI Believe that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards we have to think about this a little bit smarter\nAnd instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities\nLet's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't steal mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nTalk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we've never had them before or the droughts with facing\nLet's talk about the opportunities we have to lift everybody up and moved to a future that's better for everyone I feel like we're fighting about nothing instead of grabbing the future in running towards that\nAnd this report would it make any difference to the conversation in the United states even going to just be seen as another most of the same that washes over people's heads\nI don't think people have grabbed climate change because I think they think it's a problem for the planet instead of the people that live on the planet I'm hoping that this will reignite a conversation but that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid am I\nTo what the opportunities of future can be\nI was Gina McCarthy former administrator of
