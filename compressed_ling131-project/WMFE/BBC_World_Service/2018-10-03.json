reaction is a certain change you know while many people felt the capital came across was quite angry\nAnd for those who believe Dr Ford reaffirmed their views of him and that's really not the audience I mean do for a cabinet was speaking to Republican voters and he succeeded he put a fire under many Republican voters that they feel that he has been treated unjustly\nAnd to some extent the Democrats have overplay their hand here you know they you know even people who believe Dr Ford\nFor the most part agree that the Democrats held this delegation to the last minute and sort of dealt with it

I Believe they found the first to some evidence of the existence of an ex so moving that's the moon that old bits of planets outside our own solar system the team from Columbia University in the U.S had already use NASA's Kepler space telescope\nTo study the premises of nearly three hundred planets professor David ... told me they use it the more advanced Hubble Telescope had been the game changer\nWe always thought they were very likely to exist because for me the current system we see so many of them so I think the real question when so much whether they exist at all but one of the properties how big do they get\nWhy is it important to establish this\nWe're interested in exile names for a few reasons one of them is that these things could be habitable worlds in there and right I was not something that science fiction\nHas a lot of some of that idea things like a endorsing Star Wars or maybe the idea is that maybe my affects the habits of the of the time that they are but we think the main does influence the U.S have seen fast by stabilizing the liquidity as he asked for example\nAnd finally we want to understand how man's phone we only really have a few examples enter into the system the moon appears like a maybe a one off event but if it maybe it's inevitable outcome a planet formation by looking at the moon's outside and I saw some hope to have to do to deeper understanding how these things I've dealt in the first place\nSo just to be clear is there an assumption that if a planet has a mood and going round it's at least one there is more chance to do that that might be life on the plan is\nNot necessarily but I think if we find another twin for example one of the questions you might ask if you're interested in how about the bill is whether it has a moon twin as well for example what heights we know the ocean tides\nOn the U.S are driven by the presence of the main and those early tied to specially when it was much closer to us early in our history\nMay even pop played a role in kick starting life on our planet\nWhere is this possible PSAs discovered XO ...\nIt's a long way away eight thousand light is say we will be traveling that anytime soon and they want us to actually most distant stars that kept to look at 'em and that's why it was so challenging for us to pull off this detection and why we needed additional house got time to do it\nRight the Hubble Space telescope enabled days did it\nThat's right so we saw a hint of their signature with a capital data we had three eclipse is of the planet in front of a star three times that of the time in front of the stuff from that as we thought we saw a window that could be an end but we didn't have a conclusive evidence that points that we asked for time with the Hubble Space telescope which is more powerful space telescope\nAnd we're able to get a much more convincing sticking out of that\nYou must be looking for the tiniest ... said some way so distant\nThat sort of these are tiny signatures in at age we really see the signatures which give for I mean we can tell the planet comes into its eclipse early about an hour to LA that thousands ... something is\nPulling on the planet gravitationally I mean I think that's the main and the second signal that we see is a ... in the brightness of the style which has caused by the moon passing them trying to stop the shadow of the moon if you like in front of the south so these are tiny signature that we think we have strong evidence for them\nIs this thrilling possibility of extraterrestrial life that that most people have felt at some stage in life something that actually trying to do a scientific Korea\nFor me it's always been the last ... and ... ... when we were looking for planet lacking some beans I think a fundamental question or comment or driving force behind why we do this has to understand a unique and it's in the universe how unique this\nSolar system unimpeded ourselves and said to me looking for life on these worlds one day is the final part of that question\n[noise] professor David keeping from Columbia University telling us that are about the best evidence yet on the
