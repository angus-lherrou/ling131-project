think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is by lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLawrence is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be loosing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause death and equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of the next you see the price that someday you Cain another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLew says what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so\nUh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries\nYou know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training with an emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall\nBenefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet\nTo get these short term ... if I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there are real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I looked to sort of ...\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospitals for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nBubble that we've thought in the world you know both wind and solar say we are starting to make the change we aren't yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see action right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effective\n... working on European policy so you know should jump like with the sustainable finance area we can I say the oil financial products or pension for that has to be a line for the one point five\nParish target for example I can argue that now and the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they mentioned the world that he is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it just went to us to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one really should not see this as a luxury something that we do now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one physicist reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for this transition today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe and today they're projected to increase significantly already rich one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming business ... in the far future does this um one point five at current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this reading not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown the road and find them eat the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they ... the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie wants to come back and\nYeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and then I Do or you just made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries we win evil feeding tired Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight\nCountries that are the how the other places to see that when you both and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly cities is making it easier\nThere isn't to label called them price for instance the great\nNo but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that it's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize and there's been um scholars and partly because high is working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications on countries send a patient they're beginning to be competitive so\nIt's these investment changing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough as they say the report is reminding us okay um but I I Do think this point and he's made up their report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get to support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about costs here it's important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty second down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period\nIn the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinth street shortly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they all trends in\nThe global economy is either going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nFor we designed our cities more effectively says that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast so now thank you top panel throughout the as an adult ... Julius ... case had\nA ... year we were a gal will tell you a short break up just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas of topics you'd like us to look into you can ... the real story at BBC tilt Kato UK will treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a ... costs you can subscribe to just such for the real story in your ...\nWhen you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that he's had a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors I Know a different way of uh of going about not pushing for but arguing or four different policies\nMulti I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear what's your view to nuclear power to read it to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy report for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five dollars and make a wartime and I'm sure when the twins who does it make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little time and that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economics so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electric bio energy supply and make it a low carbon as quick as possible damage deficient in cheapest way to do that through new those\nSo uncomfortable and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for a think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the line from transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's IPC report\nFive investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but I I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything\nThat decided to say that would be swayed the administration that it needs to take this seriously uh\nI Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Julius I'm begging with us effective leadership isn't as the last\nI think there is affected leadership including in the United states and just happens not to be in the office and the president\nI'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they've used or science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think fat efficient car policies will be affected for they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science but they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in\nThe United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern to it is something that the American government her signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide to date and of course that's true how do you just aggregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I wanted to say\nI Am importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the point the facts are becoming separation from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and which he's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states and many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industry and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs he's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them further it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's the level rise is a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the Gulf War partly ... because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has been gone with this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see

commitments fairly seriously just described to us some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy would have a future but since then it sort of\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have gone right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but\nAt the scene that maybe just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just

north must take action says no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a Bible argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to try to figure out ways\nTo buy bonds the

very difficult to do that\nIf you can't get access to the communities and of course the other elements as well as as a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building and unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected\nYou isolate them and then you monitor the

looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put fear to into the atmosphere I think really sauce making ... will generational ready and move into assisted by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David case backs solar power\nAnd in a part of why they debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other\nSelf you know how hard the wind is no way you can just think of how much power winter that Nixon figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end the atmosphere is one big heat at you and it's driven by power from the sun and that power has always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the argument to most ah\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of a percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest just heat and the energy of evaporating water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around he each and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct just a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly\nImportant what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum and that in turn can redistribute heat him I'm active and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a win for him so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night when turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yeah how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit if it's weak king but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region where large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that\nBut the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so winter binder immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we ...\nI suppose what I'm saying is one when I'm On a global scale either I'm supposed to have a big ... you'll modeling is for lots of numbers of wind farms\nYeah but one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not just true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very international amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs is just slightly dented the benefits of wind farms are watching you know it's all together I don't think it\n... it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution in packs\nAnd given the very long time scale of a few too and the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon twin power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we decriminalize\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as a winter brown a race basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with winter buys and people have suggested\nSome very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts ... kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet\nAnd we get a number and it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor is\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you generated given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWell less important because I Know that you were very interested in solar power and I believe that the ... ... square meat or you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more was per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to
