very close knit not to sort of place where one expects to encourage or an act of terror and find what ... why do you think it's happened [noise]\nWell we know what the government himself said repeatedly on social media which is this is an individual who was apparently radicalized before the election of Donald Trump that somebody who latched onto series and ideas\nAnd the president and supporters have been promoting and came to believe that Jews were arranging for the vision of the United states by Latin American immigrants and he intended to put a stop to it\nIn your opinion President Trump is to blame\n[noise] well I I Want to be very careful about that I think that this wasn't entirely correct or consequences for the president's rhetoric which is not just this is what he desired\nBut we have seen a pattern of irresponsible and inflammatory statements from the president and when he has made those statements and refused to qualify them or to speak to his own supporters\nAnd to tell them they no uncertain terms that she does not wish to see violence we have seen individuals latch onto that individuals who may be disturbed or you ranged a and take it places that perhaps the president never intended to go\nBut I mean ... what is happening in the U.S at the moment\n[noise] well I think it's a very unsettled week and it's been a week or violence one which the United states has come face to face with Jim and there was a shooting at the supermarket after gunmen attempted to enter a black church was turned away it'll store there was a shooting in a synagogue or a mail bomb center fourteen critics of the president\nThis sort of violence is not unique in American history but it is at the moment in a way that many Americans find profoundly disturbing\nYeah the middle ground seems to be vacated yeah\nFor we have two things going on one is a sort of hyper partisanship\nAs American society or the rides and folks on both sides of the aisle feel\nAggrieved done wrong or their political opponents but I don't want to suggest that kind of a false equivalence here there is no question that most of the acts of violence entire that we have seen in every two years at this ministry shouldn't have come from the political right which feels really invigorated and kind of empowered to actually set a fire right\nWe are talking about a small and radical fringe but but uh friends which is prepared to\nTo do on its own hands on the ground killing the harder it is to turn to\nYou on the apple bound that Washington bureau chief of the

Still with us in a moment to have an update on the latest news [noise]\nTo innovate trench here that all of our packaging can be probably recycled welcome fostered by twenty twenty five and tried to reconstruct laid the project that used to it you increase the level of recycled materials had this huge tactic packaging\nHow are you going to do that\n[noise] ah well first of all if it's something that is not necessarily a new to you know leave a back injury a thousand and ten we should talk in terms of reducing awake about packaging and wait about packaging and then twenty Seventeen we signed up to ... we made our commitments drank all of our packaging cleaver usable recycler combustible\nAnd so we're them being innovating in space now for a number of years or so for example we've never had with bronze call of duty in kind of which is a practice or to a hundred percent recycled and made with a hundred percent that recycle content\nThat we started with that companies like I Want to\nDo through a process of chemical recycling every cannot use recycled PTA if I can to our food packaging with elements in there in the u._k.\nA bigger area however there are tackling it issue problematic packaging because today I'm most problematic packaging or a multi multi laminate reputable material\nWhich today not recyclable or not we being working with the company the front of an issue in Gemini\nProcess called Korea solve which will actually allows them to act on what is today not recyclable materials into recyclable polyethylene and then the years that material back into the degree used in places like Indonesia and India\nThat so we really Bastille plastic now isn't it\nWill show the the kind of I'm sure it made or two and she was a tactic to fully reusable and recyclable so this isn't really doing away with plastic at the end of the pie that that is a very important material and I think they ambition is to ensure that plastic remains in the economy into going to the environment\nAnd show the innovation entrenched you that we can make all of our plastic to be easier to recycle a composite\nTackled and not problematic packaging wicked county recycling therefore yeah it is not remaining part of our economy so it certainly moving away from from a very essential packaging material but ensuring the practice and the economy and doesn't go into the environment\nYeah ... is that not possible and to move away from plastic altogether\n[noise] well probably very versatile material that they're using the costs are wide\nRange of packaging and internally we have a framework which talks about\nSort of less toxic better practice but also it no plastic\nSocial aspect is what you would expect which is to agree to reduce the amount of packaging that we're using in our ... worldwide that better prospect is by making up packaging recyclable or with a higher level of recycled contact\nAnd that's where their technology such as careers all come into play that but it costs for some ...
