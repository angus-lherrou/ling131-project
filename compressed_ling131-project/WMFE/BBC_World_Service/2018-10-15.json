eight percent white women actually believe Dr blazing Ford there is a far greater racial gap in American society now than a gender gap\nThat doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working it doesn't mean that we don't need the intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I know dried up problem\nI I get I get the industry now the argument that you could bring different groups of press people together to make common called American make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we call them groups well\nMany of us are I I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was\nA multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just suffering groups and we're not really engaging an effort to to reach across many of the different says\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing ingest that many women are particularly those that fifty three percent that in that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the President's Day how do you feel about Iraq Obama because he's with the midterms coming up his reruns of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women analogy BP Americans not as ... as I said I go\nVote from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of 'cause he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect bronco bottom of actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWhat they can stop for a president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on a on a range of issues some of them having to do with the failure to actually even have a rhetoric\nThat identifies some of the structures that continue to create inequalities\nUm I had took issue with him for example I'm On my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but then excluded women and girls but that was a minor\nUm during different within a broader reality\nThat we are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of\nAh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania I'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American power\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what where in election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive coalition it is interesting isn't it I'm going wrong brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nOr the ... democratic voters he said clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the poultry liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white with the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino supporters\nThat again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and I'm I'm group based politics it is a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater than most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator um who are with a Democrat or to be elected from Alabama and a generation on their black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women\nAs the wheels on the bus but how do we actually for thing in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political global

the fact that someone as influential\nAs Ken burners Lee has publicly not only developed these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that

encountering what seemed to be really angry or division of comments on line is that\nThere is a very good chance that the comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you

the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I just people presumably understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator out there having that conversation of telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other or at least they think\nWell yeah I mean I when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or box or algorithms whatever they might be and they'll retreat them do use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at\nThem the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and the normal people getting involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on much trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially

variety of on says to fix these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity um within the reliability\nPretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decent life to try to filter on it if he if he centralized\nBut it's also you can't delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has\nBeen talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did the interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that
