insect there one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the yin yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of evil and good and\nBalance when Star Wars the last ... came out last year some ... with the casting choices you seat never before has style will still have so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them except for the behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we call Charles in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc\nAnd out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThere were sixteen out or nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been served themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nThat just that you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer tractor that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society it's like the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who agree and something could disagree\nBut if molten ... on rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as you were if those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs yours as anger leads to hate hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already look which skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nOr it solely bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points or you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be ... pals\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that ... conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of the senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nBack to the question that we raised the beginning of the program can we conclusively say that ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggesting\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode sesame fits into a broader often one very similar to people studying the way Russia Dr ... campaigns\nBut at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and HIS Video which raises a valid point I suppose is an act of propaganda\nWell I'm going to let John ... the Russian troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real even go here is to get people to be a little more conscious about what they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be on verified information or this\nViral retreating miss very viral tweet that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing and to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what you're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we said before think twice before you ... ...\n... with my twin link\nComing up after the break which countries are at the top of the league table of generosity when we crunched the numbers\nThese incoming money and then finally there's a large body of cheap studying field research where people are studying individual Chinese government sponsored activities so we developed a very in depth methodology to synthesize all that information into a database of about forty four hundred\nChinese government financed projects than a hundred and thirty eight countries\nAround the world so to the numbers show in terms of what China is spending it tastes off the old the world's second largest economy\nOne of the major findings that emerges as the vast majority of the funding from the Chinese government\nDoes not qualify as foreign aid in the strictest sense of the term Seventy seven percent of the funding does not qualify as are the eye and over a Fifteen year period for which we have reliable data two thousand two thousand fourteen China spent roughly five and a half billion dollars a year on the o da and by comparison\nTo us provided at least twenty five billion dollars of ... each year so if you rely on the strict definition of a coordinate the U. S. outspent China by at least five to want\nA quick reminder at this point the DNA is official development assistance on a nominal terms the U.S economy is roughly fifty percent bigger than China's so for us to be outspending trying to all over the eight by five hundred percent suggests a big gap\nHowever if you broaden the definition of foreign aid to include all types of us and Chinese government financial flows China and the U.S walk a lot more like overseas spending rivals over the Fifteen year period again to thousands of two thousand fourteen\nThe U.S government spent roughly three hundred and Ninety billion dollars around the globe and the Chinese government spent three hundred and fifty four billion dollars over that same period of time\nSo if you brought in the aperture and use that broader definition of eight China spends about twenty three and a half billion dollars a year in the U.S spends about ... billion dollars a year\nTrying to get a lot of aid money to Africa and spent particularly heavily on infrastructure projects across energy transport and communications\nBecause most of these projects a commercial big darned count tools or da\n... as a pet ... number it's around four dollars per person or da\n... dollars per person when all of the money is fact and remember that the equivalent us number is a hundred and eight dollars per person brought pox pointed out to me the bulls oh China is a global economic superpower still has a huge number of people living in poverty\nOr politically giving overseas aid is difficult on mice explains why the Chinese government is so uptight about what you've\nBeen reporting [noise]\nAnd now ... asks why women increasingly turning to wellness\nDown this\nSoothing sound [noise]\n\nInto friday evening and I'm On the deck of a full ... the ... into a restaurant and you're also busy buried in there and found sirens going off and if people ordering chips down stab thoughts on that in ...
