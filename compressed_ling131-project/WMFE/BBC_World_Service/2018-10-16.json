increase diverse we increase the benefits of diversity one thing that's been that's not been talked about as much as\nLong as one of the inside of a critical mass here harbor and not many other

which I was you know in class and\nDebating highly intellectual and highly social issue that involve things like raise 'em in history\nAnd I was one of two African American men in the room the size of a huge effect on my ability to um to judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without seeing like I was speaking of everyone\nI I can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes

Americans as a general group I'm\nRepresented well both at schools that don't practice in front of accident in I argue with that\nAnd why would that be I think\nThere's a lot to do with the caliber\nOf students applying um the number of students applying I'm In ... actually I gave the applications I'm obviously I I think it makes a lot since our Asian Americans apply to harbor one interesting fact about this entire lawsuits are not discussed as much\nAs I'm twenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year roughly is Asian American\nBut also twenty two percent of the application for there's Asian every year\nWell they you up some direction two sides of the student argument is document that is being taken to the court case are taken to court or against Harvard University at the moment I should say is a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action that Harvard as a private institution\nOr because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do it and\nIt's just it's a private institution that they can

our ... as I get to meet the city's former Democratic man my boil he doesn't agree the current Eastman will lose traditional democratic voters arguing the centerpiece policy no longer on the fringe\nShe's not to the left she's really speaking out to what needs to happen it's it's the logical changed that needs to come from progressive systems of government\nSo you're saying the center of gravity of the Democratic party has changed is changing\nWhy take the center of gravity for the whole country has changed because there are people now who have no medical care where one of the few countries in the world or they're supposed to be civilized that doesn't take care of our people through healthcare so this is nothing radical\nUh the history of our the Democratic party has been progressive always has I mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid this is just the next logical step I think it's progress\nReport on November ...\n... you might if I ask you a couple more questions all her I\nWas young they can campaign volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old amount of the Republican Party how do full term congressman and to to map of Omaha he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo think about this race for the house seat here as a bellwether indicator\nNot only of how things are now but how they may be drifting over the next two years\nSeems to me that if done bacon the Republican nominee wins here that will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female\nRural or urban or suburban\nIs still leaning objectively moderately to the right\nHere with race at all as I Am head and this point in time you saw or\nOn the doorstep congressman seems to be winning hearts mind ... votes but will it be enough the victory was brutally conservative state like Nebraska sent the progressive punk fan to Washington a question for the support says she's just spoken to that don't ...\nI Believe that there is potential for our movement\nBased on current political standings and maybe I should say I hope versus I Believe\nHope rather than belief and without a democratic votes spoke to Roseanne morning she's political reporter with the Omaha will Harold she told me that this race is shaping up to me the most expensive one this congressional swing district has ever seen that at the moment she said the funding momentum seems to be with Kara Eastman\nEven raise one point five million dollars in the last three months that triples what she had before and she got a lot of money from individuals as opposed to communities are groups are companies or whatever and\nAnd it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she becomes kind of see your head and progressive business\nAnd does that mean that the rice and this one district does as we heard that from the former math become this bellwether for how the Democratic party is is running and where it is going\nYeah so the um progressing groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only one of the kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make a case in others\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno

health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nTo the top and the Democratic party or is it simply or a national picture\nSo the demographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this is the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing and she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about midterm elections which don't generally get huge turnout and that's going to be treated as so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but will not necessarily translate into votes so that's a good\nQuestion so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give voters that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up for and they haven't shown on previously for the more moderate so she's doing a lot of door knocking and the hurt and she'd seen a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the vote\nAnd you don't see many of us had dumb bacon is sizzling bacon I vote but he ... he said on the TV every coughing up but you don't see her\nShe she does have some and she's not focusing on it as much you might seem more ads for her because she got that one point two five million on but she also it's been a lot of money on voter outreach which isn't the traditional typical path they tape\nAnd what about the Trump five to how to how does he play into this race in this state so\nTrump um came here and vote and they can stuck on stage with him on\nRight now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular it's actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really not about cabinet but you're also seeing Republican mad\nAbout how Democrats handled it and one thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican winning is that they are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all women and they want to send a message no we're not\nWhat the the ... the other women say that we are\nNow is Roseanne morning or from the ... world Harold\nJamie you clearly have dumb the defining these midterms out of ammo Nebraska some seems almost went on to us while you're moving ... where are you moving next\nYes well actually heading north east to a state that the media to news outlets and it's not just in America because that would bring to which comes in one or two times before most recently for the state of the union address at the beginning of this year we met some folks who uh well they were in a district which voted heavily for Barack Obama then heavily for Donald Trump\nAnd they were big fans of it are they still big fans will have a have a look at that what else are we looking at the Senate race there which is an interesting one in fact it's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Orlando", "day": "16"}
