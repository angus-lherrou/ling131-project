I think Republican in Sudan yeah as a motive\nContinue and perhaps even grown over the next month the fact that he is confirmed seems the only way you can make them fearful is to make the argument

program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles were suggesting we were heading for something rather comma\nLet me issue me a cup of her because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warning of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat war is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures then you're likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before

have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics or intensity of that storm made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the ... Atlantic temperatures that fueled the ... I was curious how in the natural beauty and you can pin down specific changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer areas and cooler area but basically were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast industrialization so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that have had on the atmosphere temperature as well as the temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a believer particularly moved North Atlantic they are very specific package ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the tea we actually have a pattern change of the F F T that comes from the fact that\nThe kind of just to make a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can less is look under the bonus of climate change so to speak\nBecause the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they certainly interest Michael mind particularly in the like the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming\nCan suddenly create a much larger region the warm enough and we think that maybe why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see in that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic but potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater alarm they may be protected in many of the events that have mocked the past few months sea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some is recovering more poorly each winter\n\n... coming out shortly here on the b._b._c.
