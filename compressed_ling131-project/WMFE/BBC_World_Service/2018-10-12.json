in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization student according to their statements that police had been raped by their co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that\nThey were as young as ten when the ... again ... girls report to their stories to the police and the end but many other names were given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge talking\nTo you know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh Ron\nHow do the investigation unfold\nWill basically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it and it was no one in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape but a really no one has ever gone deep and to really find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is not\nThe organization right after this happened it was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nThe Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in care or so when the ... came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their pressed it meant that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central government issued an intimate relationship with under they didn't acknowledge the extent to which had in power to him by giving him the power to educate these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school\nAnd then when it came to light he had been reaping these girls essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem\nAnd there was never an exception to the fact that perhaps the organizations owned and\nOperated in cultures and challenging context may have contributed to his ability to abused young girl\nTheir mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but a trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died here it's\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually affected as well\nThe challenge with the story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that time girl had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know that to students who are named lessons victims by indictment tested positive and we also know that one of the ten\nVictims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh [noise]\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual the school continues to operate to do you have there been any changes a tool to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's certainly true that the organization sought\nTo to strengthen its policies and sought to improve its hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually they're expecting reported in which time two girls were the first time according to their students at least some definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rich came to light the organization

the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit the woman to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between

short flights being possible using ... technology supports same with law are long distance trucking juveniles\nEasy now it's like I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to and you know by specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuel it's currently constituted about eighty percent of\nOur primary energies and every kilowatt hour every message will is among those are going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys fine\nNo everybody but people do I think\nI think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know

elements of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um\nWhen I like to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the conversation with a massive increase in the months of\nVehicles that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we aren't yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products or pension for that has to be aligned with a one point five\nPowers target for example I can see that now in the parliament and no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they mentioned in the world that is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it just went to us today is that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one really should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory wants\nTo just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when I asked him the question was going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already recon observing today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far future does this um one point five current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this reading not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they she the poor of the impacts of food that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie wants to come back and\nYeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we've\nBeen able to the entire Seventy three countries we it's auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to have the ... and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly so he's making it easier\nThere isn't to label called them price for instance the great\nNo but I Do is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient\nSolution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize that there's been um scholars and partly because high and working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive\nSo it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough as they say the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this point and he's made all their report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable are not heard is not just necessary for ethical reasons\nBut it's also necessary for political reasons I guess only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about cautious important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there are three big trends are going to happen\nRegardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty says to him down to zero by twenty fifty server that appeared in the next between\nTwo thousand uh Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety shortly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional north we have a choice whether we might get sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at a ... rates of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next for two years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nFor we designed our cities more effectively says that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRole of of um the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this hostile for now thank you to our panel throughout the as an adult ... Julia Steinbeck a multi ... case has\nA ... year we were a gal will tell you a short break up just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to topics he likes to look into the ... the real story a BBC ... will treat me at ... and if you enjoy the\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for arguing or a four different policies\nMulti I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear what's your view to nuclear power not ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy report for this year's shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind is about forty five dollars and make it will time and I'm sure when the twins who does it make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economics so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electric bio energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new those\nSo uncomfortable and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still than actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the line from tradition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nFive investigated the claims and I find them want things from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deal with various effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is that I Believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they'd been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the ... say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and without effective leadership is the last\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states and just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science\nAnd they've used the science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think fat efficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government her signed up to\nSee how but how do you decide to date and of course that's true how do you just aggregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from ... from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I wanted to say\nI unimportant Lee when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... spaces in long term decline because it's cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separation from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's on with the kinds of conversation that we've\nBeen having here it is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industry and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs he's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them ... it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with fiat pick up because it's sea level rise is a good chance the warmer than average waters in the Gulf War partly because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are actually something that uh

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nYou're in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing fast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to us some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a locked in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it sort of\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but at the thing that made me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing country should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but smuggling fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost\nIndian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't positive the industrialization prices that if you liked caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat in Nineteen Ninety to ... and then five\nAt that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action fist not it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limit to face the action so it's\nIt's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to buy bonds the mistakes of the north and you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north\nTried to convince off ancient funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or\nThe investments to the south and I thought about a good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels they should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic destruction do you think\nFor a country like India that demographic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\nOf a democracy is a force is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship\nOn the other hand I think that day is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science and I think that if you can get social movement going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains\nAnd we love to hear your thoughts email us the real story at BBC don't Kendall UK\nFor me with blood shot on the team this is the real story for this week I was listening\nThis is the b._b._c. world therapists and here's what world that Trump had been reading\nTo help her for her it was widely British ... on her novel life often life when you when you guys are suffering oceanic so to rent them too and every time the car and a lot is reborn she mentions until finally she had the chance to change the course of history\nWorld club at BBC World service dot com slash world's big club\nYou are listening to the b._b._c.
