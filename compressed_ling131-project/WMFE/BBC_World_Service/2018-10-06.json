Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nHave the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention\nWas a very it's political parties have done that Rick uh several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across the land that's something that I Believe that we should be quite proud of you can ...\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars ... and that's the crux of the major leaked towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a a big country be thrown into the field to credits yeah so\nBut it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country up because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the it's actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... the new Egypt hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth the energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him carry this\nThis is not to view that shed by much the Norwegian public can actually ... we do it well it's not safe polluting when the power comes from\nNo way we take it out candy from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past\nTwenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells as a climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy trends now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on ... ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing an end that's happening in ... happening in Germany that's going to change the marsh gets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment it was fine as you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it in places like the ... seats in the up to I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about here because if we actually have to and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seventh day\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be towards the euro zero climate guessing missions can come and says well\nI think we have to see it on a great to scale because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal indoors\nBut he's not talking about oh yeah but my point\nIs that if you have the replaced coal plants with for example gas or even oil they will be more green ended a total world to my point is that if we want to make the verdict greener\nRe first has to start stopping the coal plants than when we do that we need to have something to replace it with when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to our agreement society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah ...\n...

gas fields because that's the tragedy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw unacceptable and find out what's next incident and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you

Would look at the time frame because ... says well it could be doing until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a natural Energy Agency does have just still in twenty fifty\nOne third of energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we're going to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nAnother huge huge jobs suck on on how are you just mentioned also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the China target the Paris Agreement the ... you know where he smoked and we'd be debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut he's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built tough new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with the do as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell they thought is\nHow does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become used to have I been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen there is such a moment and\nIt's become used the act but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you do that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves sudden this I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more always feels for the future can convince is kind of\nWhere to look on what are our options what are the renewables for example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our

produce it by making some of our lens part of the ... de Soleil production instead of making food\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf he wants to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they know how to do the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the stuff toward that's called actually knew now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let stuff with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down coal plants to make the word more great\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which

...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think the technology that it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting governments have spent quite a love with a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and his death has been focused on in our rights for Twenty years I think also I Need to challenge to politicians here with a greater times because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas then how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics

island big island outside of your calls from now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power they needed for all this new production\nAnd we're working with local uh energy company here are the regional and we're actually looking at it together with the community is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply the but actually for example of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits here on society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area sudden specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for any technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house building we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical thoughts and ships because for ed shit nation and I was being so\nThey're at because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration and stuff they talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in the room so I think he would rather study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually we had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can cause\nFault no love this is a closer to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to a hundred degrees shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists are great expense Mandy a matter of time sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have my I don't think you think you've made out here I Know but it's it's it sounds like it was actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my\nAnd that is why I I truly believe that that shift and veterans fish now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nNow they're concentrates that the moment I mean look at China than the speed of of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would it close higher polls have absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really need is at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe\nIs Jolie grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually dot pulls away a little bit from Russia\nGave and does it does a good story about in ... in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because you can make them independent from Russian got an old uh gas\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the burn seat comes from her first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nBerets you can argue that no agent energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn there and see they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this expression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think\nIt's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat ... that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees this

just over an hour's time [noise]\nRussia ... behavior\nWill just things I just Joyce Hackman he was a research fellow at ... and co editor of the journal of cyber policy welcome drink you were you surprised by the court [noise]\nWell actually I'm I must say that uh what's been going on with the attribution and on and so forth is not read it and you think I think what's new is like you know the kind of coordinated accusations are it is quite surprising given the level of the Russian sophistication that they would call thread ended\nBut I Believe you know when the\nUh intelligence agencies from different countries they come together and they ... you know a ... is there had an investigation altogether that gives them you know like that to uh put them in a better place to be able to achieve results and therefore uh we saw what we saw a a yesterday\nAnd what does this tell you about the scale of water might be going on behind the scenes you\nWell I mean if you look at a where the Russians are attacks have taken place you know they are it went against like organizations in uh in Canada and the U.S and met Asian Brazil and Swedes that land and and on the Netherlands in the\nUK so they've been keeping everyone quite busy\nOr and I that's basically you know and it gives you an idea of like you know how uh how much like cyber to his now are very much\nAt an essential part of the Russians are tools to advance a they're a foreign policy agenda and they use it quite a lot and you know and the all the ongoing whether the conflicts or like geopolitical Russia's that they want to achieve\nAnd all those potentially being spied palm able to resist first tools effectively\nWell basically I mean I if you the the thing is with the outside of crimes and cyber attacks is like more often than not\nUh they will be like you know what I Am already infiltrate into the system without you know you knowing about it so it's very challenging at you know about all the infiltration into the system\nBut of course you know I think what happened yesterday kind of like raises more awareness on the Russian activity and I think even though you know some might argue that Russian is not very much like a shame that but a nation that is that does cause adaptation of damage and that does ... says he said the way\nFor a more economic sanctions which would be that greedy a challenge for idea brushing economy now\nLet me bring my guessing to maybe ... of course you know what's on your mind\nWhen I was struck I mean I'm I'm a big fan of John le Carre and and and didn't know much about to the modern the modern equivalent is fine but I was struck by the ... are released by that I think the Netherlands and\nSort of at least about about the kind of how basic it seemed like they were doing you know how to ... compete full of crap meant a jacket covering and ... and ...\nAnd and they were sort of they came on the on diplomatic passport but presumably with with trace from from that from the beginning so it seems strange to me that we're talking about cyber attacks but then they had a very physical presence in the same time and I wondered about that is that how most of them are done or is is is that it just ... by by these what\nI Believe like you know these sorts of attacks that combined both ah I was reading so you have to do some sort of like a fun activity combined into his online activity or what happened yesterday with relations\nA show that can be for like a an embarrassment I Would say for the Russians and that just because they are have been very keen and the recent he has to show supremacy and ... and when you know you're caught with like a taxi receipts and like you know all these things and the with your car it shows that\nProbably there's some reckless I Am going on from the Russian party but also when you are engaged in so many operations across the ... and then you know a sooner or later you would leave some ah you know in the distance wide I Would call them digit bread crumbs but also some physical evidence that would then\nAh basically to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the uh these as spies west called in April and we only had about uh the said yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of at coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm\nJust on a purely practical level um\nIt seems to me that there is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives in the sense that we don't know if I smoke in a sort of been infiltrated we've seen really what looked like clumsy attempts that have been really quite effective and\nTo me what on certainly is a story of it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean\nIs there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds\nYou think well I think of course like you know a ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective\nHaving all these governments coming together right and accusing Russia that also puts Russia and their and their way and a good place like you know that managed to get back together all these governments and to have all these like press conferences like at all the good old\nI guess we see that that does put them in a good place by the end of the day or you know when you are at you know I caught\nYou know I you know seven times a then it's kind of a you know like
