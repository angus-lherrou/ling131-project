allowing women to drive or opening movie theaters or other issues\nAnd he has a population that supporting him a Seventy percent of the Saudi population under thirty and so that's all very exciting and encouraging\nAnd at the same time you have an economy that's been fueled by environmentally destructive oil attraction which makes up about forty percent of the Saudi GDP looking to diversify into more sustainable directions or and this this modernization which is like an architect it by the crown prince called vision and twenty thirty\n... is also very study and makes me very optimistic um and

having met him at this conference last year I'm inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is doing the best you can\nAs we mentioned she's done quite a lot already out whether it be a ban on women driving or renting and the religious police or allowing him all singers to perform in public or after money going in the workplace and while there's a lot left to be done he seems like an earnest young leader trying to move the country in the right direction\nAnd I want to support that effort so I'll be speaking at the event\nBut he takes a pretty dim view of criticism and many people have spoken out against him and indeed the authorities in Saudi Arabia have found themselves on the wrong end of the lure in prison you comfortable with that\nI I Am not I think it's a very important
