absolutely\nI never expected it to grow so big\nOkay well let's this RIMPAC cafe gets underway for for an hour now another pack fight on the other side of the wealth in Bangalore has already been up and running going for what is a couple of violence now and I'll reporter chubby such as a chubby how busy has it been while you off\nBut if there's been ebbs and flows that right now it's fairly busy um we had a ten year old have come in with the best slump she wanted fixed I'm a doctor ... suitcase there's been a few people who brought electrical appliances and like I'm a blender and um something I Can't quite recognized as a boom box\nAnd somebody's getting their shoes fixed um [noise]\nSo it's been interesting I think some people are bringing in bicycles is now\nYeah so we're we're both she

sitting along with us along with volunteers [noise] uh so uh it said the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than not taking their business I mean\nIt's quite

your assessed tend to be told to calm the retired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say it just was taking it to retire us so we take out some of the expense and the person is going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC they don't have those discussions\nAbout I think one of the things that should change in the future to get three pair back in to our daily lives is that the professional repair should become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd labor text tiny so we believe I Believe that ah the tax system should change and that label or should be taxed lower so that a professional research will become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional rip average to run their business and of course there will be different\nOr labor costs in different parts of the world better so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nAfter listening for\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work and just the culture alone people going out of their way to get stuff mended in the first place for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think that was only found out when I paid a visit\nTo a landfill thought the other day how listen to this why\nWon't become to protect today and I'm checking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThroughout this will be killed and ... yeah yeah he found that

as well during the time yeah oh yeah I've got whacked two kids that I have to run and sometimes it's just not practical exactly\nWhat's in it that was like the\nTo the camera stuff yeah [noise]\nWhen you put a hold of links and the yeah\nUm yeah that will be on the ... um Georgia or point whether I Can't use because they got fungus in general things wrong with him saying that due to the bottom ...

down to the fact that the ... in ... to about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that and to repair it was a real hair it been ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour lenses and we're

only sees the seed age\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to self especially if they knew it couldn't is going to be generally cheap and unable to quit when I Need a better job [noise]\nSo there are a couple of issues the rise to wind up in a pound of people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy they just don't have the time\nYeah obviously people are pretty busy that day to day life but ah there is a lady informed community of people around who are very conscious about this and vitamins that saying bad movie get and sometimes we get bagel just phones because\nPeople want to do that ... in ah in their surroundings and so that the things that actually being lord of the thoughts so that things don't go to lunch and\nMust you know I Wonder if you could kind of address that issue I some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe you you what kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because they're already on board with the environmental movement without ...\nHow'd you get the other people have you ... the other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip of ...\nWell that's the challenge of course but we hope to\nGet them into the ... cafe when they have something that they really want to hang on to win that when it's a Christian broken object that cannot be easily replaced by the cheap you time [noise] and we know that that's what happens when people come to the guy said they don't\nReally expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind towards a more sustainable society\nWe're running short time now ...\nCafe in a holding just still still carrying the people that are fixing a coffee machine that pulled it Paul there's a chapter with the launch Sean and get him into the workings of the divine some final thoughts and from everybody ... ways to solve it can be in ten Fifteen Years time\nWell I think there will be more repack I face because they'll they'll they'll be needed\nBut we also hope that the manufacturers realize that product should be the parable and that they should be a produce in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way\nMaybe you might have a three D printer in in RIMPAC cafe so you can principles bad policy to fix the things that you don't have the whole stretch away that movie challenging but um maybe in the future you love that Christmas new\nOh yes I mean I think the future of preparing cafe is there much around\nBringing people together and I think coming to RIMPAC cafe and it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships hunting slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow they can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider role to play than simply connecting broken always comes with Paris hits it hits connecting people with each other\nAnd\nI think sort of ruins female Tina I'm Petra here and put him to Chris in London and Chevy ... in Bangalore thank you for this thing too well time if you want to see ... cafe in action and making a video from face so it's it'll be that the\nTax will be back next week for most solutions from around the world but for now I'm all for most a clause in how to repair and electronic say just as a you know I'm going to a hero's welcome\nFor my wife comes back fix\nAlthough of course others and I thought you\nKnow that maybe that's the problem\nAnd also big tax that is known for not advertising why\nBecause they don't need to show Nike has gone to a great job hair grabbing the Mike back from other big tax and other consumer companies\nStill got away here on business daily from the BBC so is this the start of a wider trend in brand promotion I Wonder as professor Callaway suggest seeking headlines can be more profitable tactic than slashing at unconventional commercials Nike themselves wouldn't speak to the BBC for this program\nBut we wanted to get wider anyway some brands when you have also taken to activism has a personal conviction\nThey've always done it for purely commercial reasons either take Tim monitored the founder and chairman of the British pub chain whether students\nAs a longtime you're a skeptic he came out ahead of the British referendum ... membership in twenty six dean as an all didn't ... even stuck that message on these pub being matched how did that affect the best

started the bull rolling search campaign successfully\nAgainst your own and then said nothing for a long time until the referendum when the country was given a choice like everyone else had to say what's the best for the future of the economy and for our company and decided to campaign that just ...\nRight but I mean it's one thing isn't it to take your own stand on that particular question it's another just to get on your band match and to decorate your various problems with that message\nWell that's right of course there were a lot a lot of other people doing it to a lot of the ... the hundred companies\nSigned a lesser saying we'll definitely be better off if we stay in AAU\nBut did you worry about campaigning directly to your customers I suppose that's the question I mean it's one thing to go on the media and an express your personal opinion it's another given that you know presumably fifty percent of your customers might well support staying in the\nI did worry about it I'd already done during the ... the euro era and the euro debate\nAnd the way that are sick people except to do is unlike say the Financial Times or the times or the guardian in a magazine which is where I wrote a lot of my articles\nWe had our schools are doing the opposite of what I was saying so I said you've helped us so that we could cite we are and organization which here's Marge you but we will print an equal number of all the coals with the opposite view\nRight but the match pretty one sided these days on me yeah the beer match\nYou're right the bear Matt ... more one side is that they made the case for leave and I think people\nBelieve debates is required if you're going to make a good decision\nUnder the debate is part of a democracy not everyone agrees with me oh previously but you've got guys like Michael O'Leary he has made his first campaign in favor of remaining in the this is the head of Ryan and the head of rhyme there\nAnd I think it's been accepted that Michael O'Leary says one thing to says another and it's such a big existential questions for the economy but I say customers broadly welcome the debate\nThe thing about breaks it varies it it has become as ... ... a very divisive issue for many people something for the people who feel strongly about it as he even just talk right now a ... second referendum next year which would have to be even more divisive if the kid\nHow would you go into that I mean again it would put you at all with a large subset presumably of your customers\nWill that's right I think it might put the adults with a subset of them I mean ultimately a rule was set to look at the end of the day this is your decision it's a democracy that's what it's all about you decide what do I know but I think it's democracy the state's under very important\nIssues ... for freedom the economy liberty and so on\nI think it's right that this is people speak out the public isn't cheap period you know just because I make the case to leave doesn't mean they they'll agree with me\nIs there any sign that it's a positive light\nKnow which I think it's a good sign for democracy\nAbdi investors response you making the stand and and and making it public and making it a part of your public experience\nWell investors are full of the highest principals as you'll be away [laughter] share price goes up they'll stick with what you're saying I

they wouldn't\nKevin thank you Kevin Lee updating us from Barcelona when groups of whales are found floundering on beaches usually that means that got lost and confused and sometimes they can be guided back out to sea bought the discovery of sixty eight trivia whales dead on the shores of Scotland and Ireland in recent weeks\nSuggests a much bigger problem with uh put it into context to yeah to a year is considered to be a normal figure here we have\nMore than sixty I've been speaking to on through brown low director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is a little different to what we would normally see in in ... usual mortality events because I'm the conferences that are coming at a show of arming credibly decomposed so\nUm we we actually had an investigating this less smoke pathology point of view and more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed up and then they die that that when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at a because as a mortality of of mammals uh stations sales et cetera\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold must running events where we turn up on the beach and uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the wars that some of them on the beach some of them alive some of them that\nI'm I'm way investigators try and work out why they're struggling happened in this case it's it's a very different picture of what we've seen is over the the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidents of\nI'm a very unusual species that's being washing up I'm like from the sort of the the go away by an island all the way the very top of Scotland\nUm so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at sea um but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year what did you see and how many of you've seen this year\n[noise] so in a usual year um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she very little about these these class substitutions\nI'm On this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals sort of be washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ... which is [noise]\nLive very deep and the woman said that they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible speculate might be happening [noise]\nWell this is what makes this quite tricky because they um they as you say that the species that live well off the shelf ... survey they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive any any animal\nUm they'd be in ... to just under three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down there\nThe reason they go into the the the such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... I there's a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is a normal habitat for this species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash your shoulders very limited amount of pathology that we can divide from from them because it in such a expensive states who decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware but this particular species is particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human generation or underwater noise in an in specifically effect to midway and so now\nI'm ... something that we would want to try and establish whether or not there was any particular activities going on off the shelf age\nI'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the main and bottom\nAny ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and let's see for quite a long time that something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nAnd indeed it does I mean we we've we've made their ... divide noisy place and I'm not so that sort of a general problem in this specific case\nFor them we have is is that they have the people that all the lights the major Einstein all off in the military and loving information from them can be quite challenging\nUm the reason that the military operates a an a sudden all this frequencies is that it's used for um communication on a source of useful locating into objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive national security level said trying to get the information\nAs to whether they'd be an operation can be challenging however what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not they are noise is a plausible reason that these animals started so we want to rule out all the other things that could potentially have caused them to stand such as talks in infectious disease\nI'm I'm trying to establish ... what is the most likely reason for this this large mortality\nSo many questions Andrew Brown do director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme on those sixty eight\nA trivia whales that beats and they should be swimming about two kilometers down but they're dying of disintegrating on the shows of Scotland and Ireland you're listening to wilt up dates from the BBC [noise]\nOne final question people always say that the election was bound to happen wherever it is and the well they always say this is the most important election we've ever had we've had for years and years and years\nWhat do you read anything how important he's this\nElection they'll ask about him you know there are some\nFor my generation and since the military to sixty four it is the most important election what's the risk is our democracy our values and principles ... mostly for some validity\nEver I'll do an unjust oh from the ... in Brazil ending that report from Tim Frank's in the northeast of that country well I've been speaking to professor Anthony Panetta he's director of the Brazil Institute at King's College in London what all Brazilians voting for this time around\nThey got a very complex ballot to deal with for the first round there Thirteen candidates for president um they've got a book for state deputies federal\nDeputy senators I think when it comes to the presidential election it's shaping up into two horse race between for them to a dodgy ... and those are that's a difficult choice for many Brazilian voters because of the nature of both the candidates and the parties that they come from\nHow much do Brazilians want to vote for this pack of politicians bearing in mind that Lula who you know once upon a time had the reputation of a U.S ally saint and is now in jail for corruption and all the other corruption scandals around the\nFederal company and the buying of votes how excited are Brazilians about voting for any politician\nI'm not sure that that excited that there's a lot of trepidation about this one and many people will be choosing the lesser evil or the the least bad candidates that they can find Brazil was sort of on auto pilot from the period\nNineteen Ninety four to two thousand ten you had a series of elections where when there was a second round of the presidential election it was a choice between a center right candidate in a center left can date\nAnd they agreed on a lot of major policy issues\nAnd now you've got quite a hard right candidate enjoyable for NATO someone who's economic advisor Paolo get it to stay privatized every state on the price that you can what type a flat tax let's end affirmative action in universities lets the ideal or jazz or\nSchools teaching and so on and then you got for not to a dime jeep from the workers' party which ruled from two thousand three to two thousand and sixteen and many people don't want to see back so you've got a hard core that would\nBe very disappointed at either a dodgy ... presidency\nSo does that mean votes ... who has a reputation for\nBeing very outspoken and very unpleasant ways talking about we had five children unfortunately one of them was ago that kind of thing because at least he something different and the corruption tightened so many who are on the progressive side is he likely to win\nI think if you look at the polling there was a new poll today that had the second round scenario had both ... and a dodgy in a technical times forty two percent each so he definitely has a chance to win the election we also said about the dictatorship for sixty four to eighty five the mistake of the dictatorship was to torture and not to kill\nIts opponents so he's got a very hard line stance on that in his vice presidential candidate general morale is talked about well maybe if there's too much disorder the military is going to have to close down Congress I Would say yes he has a chance to win\nIt may be that the antipathy and the electric to the Workers Party is going to outweigh the reservations that people have about some of these things that both so NATO is set in their offensive to women into afro Brazilians gays and so on whatever the outcome is likely to be quite close between the two of them\n[noise] and that's a professor and so they are that are from the Brazil institutes at
