copy fetched fifty six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds more than five times what was expected and that report\nPotential downside well I think the the number one question is that assumption of fraud until we can have an honest discussion about fraud without people screaming at you when you say the word fraud the American people will only view it in terms of inconvenience saying voters or suppressing voters\nSo we need to get to the truth first and find out just how big a deal is this frog what aren't persuaded one hundred percent as that is so high it shocks the census\nSomeone else who seems dissuaded ... is President Trump he's routinely claim that millions of people voted illegally when he was elected two years ago\nHe's never offered any evidence of that claim but often the election he did set up a commission to investigate election integrity from votes costs to folks have registration forms\nThere's no actual or real verification done by election officials once they get that for them to make sure that for example it's a real person\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and\nHe was a member of the president's commission\nAnother example to the problem is is there's a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that\nCitizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check that's a problem and is the problem that in many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place give them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are tearing up a specter for problem where there wasn't really a problem how do you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand a what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes\nIt would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and is probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of\nVotes ... in the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate back in the thirties suppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a big patronizing I think and frankly borders on races to believe that for example African Americans\nDon't have the ability to get an idea either way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nBut many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intend to impose cures for problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with or most surgical precision tons if you could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to a depressed turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down\nThe exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready them and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the mold and fight the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud\nI think it's a very small problem and one that has been exaggerated\nI think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county ... county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur\nAnd so I I think there has been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican none of the aisle who have exaggerated the rent for political purposes and have made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nThat if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out surely you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there\nAre targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting and

I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds\nThat was a time when the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states and Europe\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is\nIf you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy then the situation is quite different and it creates a new\nClass stratification that entails new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures on challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think\nAbout the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ...
