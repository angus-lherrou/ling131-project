not seek reelection as leader of a center right CD policy in December she's held that post since two thousand\nSnow the move is seen as an attempt to silence critics in her party and win back the

party to see a few they many thought that those leaders would step down before miracle would\nUm so this was obviously a definitely a way to silence some of the critics and her party and also just signal a change in in German politics and say we listened we've heard the voters and we're we're ready to change something\nShe framing it as a personal responsibility things aren't going well on to lead all take responsibility for that or is it more perhaps about giving her a smooth transition I she leaves power and the next couple of years\nI think that that's definitely serve both purposes um as well as she she also didn't say that she would be stepping down from the chancellor eight immediately she won't be stepping down\nUntil she intends to not step down into twenty Twenty one um and I think that this gives her enough time in her own party to she said that she won't influence who who will be her successor either\nAnd perhaps than the chance late or our as the head of the CD new but it's definitely gives her time to smooth things over to ease that transition and to try and continue to have some influence with in the party that she's lead to for the past Eighteen years has

as well or or or issues that seem more pressing to the people living here like rent uh their their their pensions on the chair homes and things like that\nAnd I suppose it'll be a question is if she is on her way our old does she have an obvious successor\nThat's what's going to be extremely interesting as soon as she announced or even the report and she hadn't even announced it officially by the time at least three people jumped in the rain yesterday saying that they would like to succeed her um\nI think that she got her her pick her she's got her main person in mind and that would be a CD
