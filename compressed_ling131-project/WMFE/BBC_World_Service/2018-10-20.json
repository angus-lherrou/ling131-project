Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nWhat has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also create\nA social atmosphere of fear for almost on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on special little social media board I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us to be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity\nAnd ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're gonna think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nYou might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's the censored there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful\nAsia it's the intolerance headline we'll just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the cannot see of course they're real differences out and that to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out Jesus I read we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus in this shouldn't be warm\nBut the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow from everything else and that's that's the way the bench politics has become\nSo very ... I really would like example is I mean I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic a hand wringing about authoritarianism\nAnd lack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example the only example that would have given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nLet me give you a couple of examples but first what I wanted to make the uh but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met him make but it's absolutely right which is that where disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to be a few cases if we sat there is a specific problem with police volunteering as African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two white people who got shot by the police as\nWell I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off ... people have never lived in a monoculture religious monolingual states this is no send you a situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's just 'cause I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee no longer function political parties trade unions churches synagogues temples most some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institution and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness as a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center then it's by definition exclusive briefly ...\nI think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier\nUh yeah ... well that's led to disagree with a premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a ... ethnic ... hotel conception of themselves and find God who started to challenge that we now live in such high too much mostly embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that that is something that I talked to quite new ...\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which they're addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a\nFalse and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by is minority than black people and women and townspeople and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for any quality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for now to our panel\nGrandfather Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian pops we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think that the program or any ideas the topics she likes to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't kettle UK or treat me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nSo that come in on that place um I like the W. W. see either white watching golf is a very interesting construct\nWatching sausage as as a whole have not done while on the working class as as a whole on not white that they too white people but they're all working tosses who have been at the shop end of ... near liberalism of capitalism\nIf pressed ... because they're working class not because they're white there was no evidence to tell us that the white looking classes are doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all black working\nClass which is an interesting and important point I Want to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German states elections in Bavaria what happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see if you which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller that policy than it had been hemorrhage face the greens on one side and to the anti immigrant AFDC on the author meanwhile the S. P. D. which has left us and to ... ...\nIt seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant or you know I'm lifetime ... I Do feel happy and his biggest space people pushing themselves into those\nWell I think now because the mainstream parties offering something that's inclusive been off they still stand for you know a consensus that failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with that of course the working class is not simply watching a lot of other components of the of the working class have suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know we'll rebelled against the status quo and and who we to tell them to somehow bad and the masses last semester fathers had asthma and I said I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying is\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe're look at the most depressed people in the early ... my son in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the president will sort of rational you tells you maximize increase as\nWe are people who are involved each we have people embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane disabled but longing and I'm going to place to people to communities incomes as much as we can all today that feeling out of politics or religion or\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning the who onto westerns and is part of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense and on the longing that actually that that identity that was that before whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how their their duties or the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement shouldn't saying on the one hand and the UP on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strict like you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinctions it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want represented\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable in some ways it was if you'll never end a remote the in India and you\nAre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it wins bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country\nThe idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic um in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive calm\nSorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just tell us that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the\nLarger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all the politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay I mean I'm\nVery bad language like that yeah I mean I think the question is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with the family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious or ethnic group\nAnd the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society you know productive manage\nA one on such which I've person these talks have been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics for the last twenty twenty five years\nI don't think that's realistic because actually fashioning the age of globalization nationalism retain an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic heated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it for ... to make it includes if to say that either hire a collective\nUh it is a level of magic kingdom of looking at states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under the common identity and how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots [noise] um\nI think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its fold and all its you know adopt a side of history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country or wherever they from you can also respect patriots\nHi I'm off on taking all of our

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nAnd do the how to book moves which there's a point during the book can you refer to this several times the theme of silence so the imposition of silence on people what are you getting at when you focus on that specifically\nNo actually actually silence is part of one of the big draw in my experience is\nThat do the victims are there are times by the term than they are silenced by history because the police union steward he was never hurt because there was another story which was covering\nAnd for the word which means you know the other story was bigger because it was beautiful made that story that is the the articles was done by Europeans and so the whole book your dialogue with sinus how you can make citations speak ... to take\nThe fragments of words you know the mother of of of and I'm used to speak in in fragments and fragments for ... and he could lift demeaning from the fragments of her silence\nAnd the whole book this I mean these are good with silence distributed of understanding silence and of making from silence\nLet's see a meaning for position and also the third thing about science is you know you know\nWhen I was ... the use of ... we're not good with respect to because they went through there is this like ... this is the term was because he was in his ...\nAnd those who went to their their shapes the Jews of furor ordered by the students in Palestine I think they were very heroic going like sheep you know when you really try to understand that I think it's more with John partying\nSo staying silent instead you have no ... they had no when you when you have another had no other\nChoice actually but it's not a position to beat out Custer to be not understood and to mean that you ought to call it it's not covered this is something that's\nWhat about breaking this audience\nYou know breaking the silence is is is there which comes afterwards it comes from ... years and I was thinking about the size of the troops and the signage will be victims we've come out little by little ... and ... for my story and the duty and I think\nYou know history is written by the victors\nThe victims that only resort is threats students and the ... it's more about food that history\nAnd that could be applied across the ... of course the more victims were able to tell their stories the impacts they would eventually have to\nYou because you can reach in Pakistan which can be anywhere in other words\nIt can be an ... you know and the second volume is coming out of ... for the English are to be in two years you will see it's the same situation I'm not speaking about the the numbers\nBut the situation where victims find themselves is very familiar with orders humans we have all the right to dignity and through life\nWhat reception has the book had any throughout\nThe book came out in Israel for months ago\nIn Hebrew and the first edition was I'm Out of print in two weeks you know the V. something\nVery very important is that even with the dominance of loose or a ... a ... I ... in it or do you still there are people who are my other my mentor try see myself in in the\nLebanese Russia early is to really fun to go to many novels or the program left that notion of silence like how much do you chime with what he was talking about\nI mean I think one of the things that he is trying to do it as he says he's trying to give voice to the victims that are written out of history and I think that that uh the world over the world and there and I think that in some way retelling stories such that the victims of the Holocaust are not meant to be cowards are making out the Palestinians\nWho ended up being expelled or remained or do we tell their story in ways that allows for them to be incorporated re incorporated into the stories we tell about our past it's been something that actually had asked what he's been doing since the Nineteen seventies that my almost every novel that he was right and that's been concerned but the question is\nHow what the place to these people can take in history and he's long although he himself is Lebanese in a long time that the question of Palestine and many of his novels or about Palestinian\nAt the moment it's a story about even more impact it has obviously absolutely I think um you know ... narratives um which is what stories are incredibly are important and in fact we\nSee it every day we engage in the battle of narratives and what are we forget and the problem is oh was that um the nationalist or the rights we as a for a long time have been much better in telling a story\nThan um liberals 'em and certainly in the past twenty five years with sort of forgot how to tell that story that narrative which was very powerful and that's what wall a actually a much more than anything else than the military or the economy okay and the Cold War\nAnd what does the government said they'll do about it\nOr the government was forced to order a review and at a point to the British public health expert Dr Gabriel scali and his report was published quite recently and he found the cervical strict system was doomed to fail he found serious gaps in the expertise in governance of us\nHe did find no evidence of conspiracy corruption or a cover up\nBut he was highly critical of the attitudes and lack of openness by some doctors and ... of the results or the way they were told and he called has called for a mandatory open disclosure into health system here so legislation needs to come into play structure or something like this\nDoesn't happen again under discussion as we speak at those a conversation tribunal being set up to avoid women like Nicki feed them and ... and I think we're going to having to go to court\nFor difficulty hearings to get compensation\nGo do the women who were affected by these Smith tests that were incorrect labor pool shed now ...\nThere's going to be other as a doctor scali appeared before a parliamentary health committee last week to discuss his findings and he said the basis by which to hate Jessie the ... executive has calculated this group of two hundred and Twenty one women that that was slow so he did say undoubtedly more women will be found to be affected\nThe results were view we're going to be a review of but one thousand days hundred and fifty slides by a team from the royal College of obstetricians and gynecologists in Britain\nSo that should tell us more some women understandably don't wish to get involved in it or for legal reasons won't give consent for their side to be examined there will be more women the exact numbers we don't know yet\nEither talking to federal powers now against the world life expectancy lead tables that out with predictions for how long people living in different countries might live on average in the future and Japan which had the highest life expectancy and twenty sixteen thousand topped the charts so who does\nYour Japan's been leading the world for ages and this focus it goes up to twenty forty says life experts in Japan will be eighty five point seven years well it's been bitten by point one of us a little over a month by studying at eight to four point eight years\nAnd this is in the future that isn't that isn't now\nYet this is the projection looking at current health trends whack countries all around the world are going to be by twenty forty and bought\nThis team of scientists have done is they've looked at Seventy nine risk factors that affect your house or that's things like smoking rates obesity rates but also by the people have access to clean water and sanitation and some more unlikely things like income and education levels\nAnd pollution looking at those trends and then for casting into the future in about Twenty years time ... impact those changes and those trends are going to have a life expectancy so all the countries all around the world\nSo Spain's getting it right what are they doing\nWell it's this transition that we've talked about before and I think most people know is going on of how the things that kill us the stuffing being those big infectious disease from them more diseases of lifestyle things like heart disease some types of cancers as well and ... Spain is doing quite well out\nIf those good lifestyle behaviors and say\nIf the good old fashioned Mediterranean diet but also lower smoking raises one of the things that keeps them ahead of Japan which has a slightly high smoking right particularly in men enough how Spain has managed to leap off the table\nAnd his life expectancy still rising in most countries whether or not that high middle income countries\nWill globally they're expecting a full point for ... increase in life expectancy over the next decade and a bit\nHowever it is a mixed picture and you could get a lot of rich countries making\nA huge amounts of progress places like Japan Singapore staying in Switzerland or all going to have life expectancies over eight to five years on average according to this focus but you get other countries Central African republic Zimbabwe Somalia the sofa or under sixty five year so what you're seeing is\nThe water is being progress being made that huge gap in between the poorest and the richest countries isn't closing\nAnd this report also has a warning that what is it tends to do is work how will the best case scenario and the worst case scenario is for life expectancy in the coming decades\nAnd it says that in his worst case scenario if things go quite badly wrong them off of countries around the world could actually see that life expectancy folding so do you think that living in the mid to late eighties as a done deal Cody\nOh thanks for that maybe I made to Spain now James let me ask you a question do you say me grain on\nMigraine I say my ...
