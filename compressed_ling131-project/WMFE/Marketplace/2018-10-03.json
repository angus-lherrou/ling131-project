never be satisfied and I think I'm more explained that we're going there regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I give you just do remember ducks\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot of liquid ... a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it\nWould have created another hundred billion dollars of equity most over capitalized for him in the world the government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah rapidly and it was a ... or to unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse 'cause they had to sell assets\nThat was ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I guess still sort of my client did not have to run a panic\nBut not always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem

what's happening in a way from banks are you worried\nAbout you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians

strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road somebody happens is too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my in my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like Joyce it can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\n... jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get the
