and the ball on this Friday was this September unemployment report it was a good no hundred thirty four thousand new jobs in nearly fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there than merger further whereabouts farther afield I'd never get 'em right doesn't rebel Richmond Washington both Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody\nTake a hike ...\nJobs ... you're on that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that ah the Drudge Report was actually doing a little bit of a mess on the number of jobs but but people should be happy with the wages however are another thing entirely still an again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be a market for that right at wages wages where the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained growth in wages as a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth at two point eight percent it was enough to spark some concern in the market\nThat this what's that went over to consumer and prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and growth was enough\nTo concern the markets about inflation and rising rates and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a still a president who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a dynamic and strong and a growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play off\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with terrorists and counter terrorists\nAnd breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built on to try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place\nA plus elements of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly are breathing a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure I is kind of a hill there that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nThat that's a good law the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists had which as you point out you are\nA ... and pull it back for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talk about what Catherine we're talking about this idea that we are now distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened took a long way longer with much more drama then probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China\nAnd the development of the emerging world\nWhere we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reason for pushing back\nAnd so as much as markets chaired the continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as roads that smells as sweet um it's hard to translate a U.S flow when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power and trends of their economic strength and the supply chains and which they are they set right in the middle of\nYou to have some

she was in fact your vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nUh Joe Manchin doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know mother Tuesday\nI Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done right there are a budget that have to get down there are\nSocial programs and and a foreign bills and all of that stuff still has to be done thirty seconds to you and then to me or where does things were the things that\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage our and and the presidency as well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we had so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around\nFor the last crisis uh ten years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's going to happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones\nKnew what you quickly please sure and I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the political dysfunction if you wanna call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nUh a lot

order to switch jobs he has to transfer as if he's from one employer to another\nThat process under the Trump Administration now takes six months or longer it used to take a couple of weeks even

to be making work visas more difficult\nThere's more open jobs right now than Americans looking for jobs so employers are really looking for the talent they need wherever they're from so visas immigration is obviously required in that situation and in many cases\nUs immigration officials declined to be interviewed for this story but said in a press release back in August that they were
