Congress do It's Tuesday October second it's good to have you with us\nBefore we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bay those act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages well Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nWait hind employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour say you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by that\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers ah they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions and they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about ... about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that direction\nReally I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier\nUm so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market\nAs Walmart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right at the same fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly\nThere are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economy and\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses\nOn their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local market would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend\nWhen pay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if\nWages go up generally that's great but we have that experiencing some uptick than inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much thinks any\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit\nMeanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage so what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best\nAlex ... is twenty two years old and works part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWould I just to me it's just a permanent job which are miles but actually like fucking like forty hours every week or more than that will show much\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah she's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we had bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with him being able to pay off its debt\nI actually just paid off last year a car loan\nHe says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their

own property on the beach obviously want the beach to stay where it is and those teachers are very important to the tourism economy\nHow much does all this cost and where's the money coming from\nIt costs a lot um so many of these projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state a low and the federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up and that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so their government should help fund their economies\nThe people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties\nThese tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone\n[noise] this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually find most of this work themselves to the local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides a which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they use that economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is\nIs that the corps tries to see which projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities but something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the effect is that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example tell me about rights ville beach\nSure right still beach has been rebuilt I think more than twenty times in history and uh this is a community we found where you know some of the properties right along the ocean are easily worth millions of dollars\nLisa song she wrote about beach nourishment for for how much I think you\n\n\n\nFall if here
