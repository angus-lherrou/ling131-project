E. Cano political I think I'm quoting that phrase officially by the way it came from former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn today he did a whole thing on CNBC said he is really pleased with the state of the economy overall except for this one thing\nWe are a service economy our economy's driven by Serbs were eighty plus percent of our GDP eighty plus percent of our job creation as services junior service economy\nThe way to stimulate your economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to say anything that raises the price of a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government doesn't care if it's just another tax\nAlthough they never did actually come out and said it's widely believed cold left the White House over the president's decision to go ahead with the trade war that we are in and a trade war by the way\nIt does seem to be picking up a little bit of steam commerce secretary Wilbur Ross was in Brussels as we talk and things over with the European Commission and you might recall back in July the president agreed to hold off on his threat to hit European auto imports with terrorists that would have been a very very big deal\nThe president agree to hold off while the two sides negotiated the bigger trade deal\nWell three months later both sides are now blaming the other for lack of progress on any discussions with raw saying quote our president's patience is not unlimited marketplaces name is Scott has the transatlantic latest\nBack in late July European Commission president John ... and President Trump stood side by side in the rose garden and announced the makings of a deal\nWe agreed today first of all to work together towards zero terrorists zero non tariff barriers and zero subsidies for\nNon auto industrial good thank you so what's the holdup\nFinance professor Jeffrey bird stranded at the University of Notre Dame says for one thing us trade officials have been a little busy hammering out another deal to replace NAFTA and that involved just three countries\nWould you take up to twenty eight countries in the European Union it's a very demanding procedure demands a lot of time\nAnd Michelle Egan a fellow at the council on Foreign Relations says some of those non tariff barriers like different regulations and industry standards are hard to resolve\nTheir differences in regulations on ... for example because of animal testing different things and the way cars are tested in terms of safety light saw seatbelts\nAnd then there are the politics says Charles caption professor of international affairs at Georgetown he says in Europe growing anti Trump and anti American sentiment could be another road blocks\nAnd I miss kind of the Atlantic you've gotta protection a president who is none too keen on striking a deal with the ... because he sees it as a ... vote there has been seeking to take advantage of the United states\nOn the other hand ... says the Trump Administration has a big incentive to forge a deal to put pressure on a bigger trade target China [noise] my name is Scott Free market place\nSo that's trade the early part of this week economic news was was dominated by the budgets actually the budget deficit of seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars of it last fiscal year a Seventeen percent increase over the prior year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of the increase in what we're going to do every year is because the federal government is pulling in less tax revenue thanks to the tax cuts passed last year yes the tax cuts that were going to pay for themselves marketplaces Kimberly Adams checks in on how that is going\nSilly yeah despite the rhetoric in the run up to the passage of the tax law\nThe tax cuts were never going to pay for themselves\nBrian Reed all is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and used to work for the Senate Finance committee\nAt this point there is no real scenario by which the tax cuts for themselves they're probably going to cost about true or two and a half trillion dollars over ten years\nBut let's review that scenario where they do pay for themselves over ten years\nFirst you cut corporate taxes businesses invest that increases productivity wages go up and boom that magical three percent growth per year we've heard so much about our upon a notch or at the American Enterprise Institute says it's too early to know what's working\nSo I think looking at one year's numbers and saying about the tax cuts are not working and adding to the death sets instead of reducing them I think is is it's kind of misleading\nEven if things take time she says isn't the only issue we paid for these tax cuts with debt\nEven in an ideal world where everybody imagines a tax cuts they find themselves in that Kennedy takes place in a situation where the tax cuts themselves and not deficit financed\nAnother wrinkle companies aren't spending their tax savings the way tax writers planned stand colander is an expert on the federal budget for example he says we've only seen a modest increase in wages also\nCompanies aren't investing they're using it to pay off debt and they're using it to a payoffs are stockholders and do a variety of things that don't actually increase economic activity\nAnd they will need to be a huge boost in economic activity if these tax cuts are ever going to pay for themselves in Washington I'm
