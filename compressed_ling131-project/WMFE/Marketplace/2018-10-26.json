there was going to be a buck numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be\nOne Neal Richardson from ... from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody\nHi tai chi chi so let me start with you uh and and ah in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a tree she shouldn't Wilson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the tank and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nNeal it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there is a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's play it down to two things one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger grass and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now things are looking good economically speaking and that is good as Catherine's had because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do in your voice new\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd care if in trade tension concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears ... might them out\nWell well uh [laughter] so so here's the thing just on the street and terrorists and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to get billions of dollars in the United states because of all these are not mentioning that consumers are going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't\nI don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same all Street Journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists then you know like basically in the same breath a you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists aren't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president watches the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about that the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nMueller do the right I'm from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered by Jay Powell a his biggest uh economic problem I'm even a as a German ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with the president says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about Rachel what does this kind of perjury supposed due to the might object though\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what the fed is really concerned about is how they keep the economic\nFor market renting how they keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women as\nAnd we know that it will be aware and eventually the next session hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to test out\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession and they want to do so in in a context of economic growth\nAnd that that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero right so\nAlong that path any political ... political ... of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart the his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for a port\nRichardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you think ... thanks guys have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to
