[noise]\nIn Washington DC I'm Lizzie O'Leary in for high rent them it is Monday the first of October good as always\nTo have you with us and we start today with NAFTA or rather than deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars are new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\nAre you living right manufacturing powerhouse that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs are at the center of the rhetoric of everything a and B and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right\nNow sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup boost that up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's pick North American cars even more North American ... met here's the problem\nThe problem is distinction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else I'd take away your phone that we see that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars in Mexico\nWhere it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers Dr way out of the great recession you might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chimed in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and this bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent in a non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen he talked about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and they're pretty Asian and that is to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour\nTo fit into that so there's still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more so what uh companies do when we just got pushed apple sometimes yes they hire more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw scored and more robust more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly and take off all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table um it's a little confusing what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have terrorists on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place in the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that and it's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing interesting here in D.C today what are the chances that don't get approved by Congress\nWell good luck with your predicting a vote on this time next year after the midterms when there is a good chance of Democrats convert will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history question for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to marketplace dot ORG and click on a little tab that Ted mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S MCA the White House says the agreement is day quote when for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he\nRuns lost his ranch is in ... Washington they grow apples and also hops yeah for beer Washington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers we've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here\nAll right so based on what you know so far hum how does this deal look\nI'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of this\nDo you do you think the people around you um are you know X hailing a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important market for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nAh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico hit a selfish to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now the apples in this deal has no tourists applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do you do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year I had that ship friday sale\nThink we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good movement into Mexico in the first four or five months of the year\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nIs that we'll get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting there thinking this is just nasty again or are there differences that you see I mean I was just plan for you on the ground is at the same thing with a different name\nThat does kind of looked like up from our end right now I'm ...
