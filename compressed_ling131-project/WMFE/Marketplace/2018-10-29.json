my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view and brown and recording there

rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah ... you know yes I mean magic ... definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business they don't do so too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to read uncertainty was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground Lucian oh yeah oh my God it's like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long

about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial Reid called you and says don't blow it with a family business and then you have to file your brother so much that was\nIt was very very difficult um you know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what your doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about about making a change from prior management and your brother you should wait a number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because perhaps I did wait too long um
