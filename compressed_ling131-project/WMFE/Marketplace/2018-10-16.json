I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nSo the winners from those Trump tax cuts are starting to show up in earnings reports banks first among them she'd be Morgan Chase bank of America Goldman Sachs the list goes on of all done well this earnings season plenty of companies are of course benefiting from the change the tax code but as marketplaces ... bears reports and W. E. S. A. in Pittsburgh the banks are a special case\nBefore the tax bill the corporate tax rate was thirty five percent\nNow it's Twenty one percent and for banks and other financial institutions that's doing one thing missing earnings that's Nicole ... director of federal projects that the Tax Foundation\nShe says while the corporate income tax with thirty five percent most companies found so many loopholes they weren't actually paying close to that but for more tightly regulated banks the tax cut was really real\nSo that boost last a temporary provision in the tax law allowing businesses to the doctor capital expenses now and not over the years that they appreciate means profit\nPlus that that just raised interest rates again it's pretty much win win win for banks that on the air Subramanian finance professor at UCLA\nBecause of the tax reform on because of the rising interest groups and generally the economy's doing OK so all of these things are lining up in favor of the upper system the positive impact and profits\nBut that tax cut is a one time when fall prey to bang going forward they'll have to sustain demand some when there's no tax cuts and next year's corporate tax rate will be Twenty one percent just like this year and that could be more challenging mark mazer is an economist at the tax policy center\nAnd so if they want to see an increase in their earnings for sure that actually have to have an increasing their earnings from operations\nWhich could happen if you've got one eye on interest rates you can see them inching up American barest for marketplace\nOn Wall street today will you remember last week when Mary also told me her sources were telling her it was just bad couple of days and then once corporate profits started rolling in Wall

the country hasn't recovered nationally about sixty four percent of households or owner occupied still five points lower than before the crisis\nYou might think that's healthy that too many people bought homes before the crash but Susan Wachter a real estate finance professor at the Wharton School says too much homeownership didn't cause the melt down it was how people paid for their homes\nReckless mortgage lending is what drove the financial crisis and the resulting great recession\nYou know the second mortgages and cash out refinancing and exploding teaser rate loans considering what happened to Emily and Alfredo Cervantes back in two thousand two they bought a town home in a Denver suburb for less than two hundred thousand dollars\nThey had one at a thirty year

Alfredo salary as a mechanic Well Emily went back to school but after five years or\nRate jumped gosh it doubled\nBy that time in two thousand seven the market had turned and home prices were falling

for families but for communities Laurie good men is co director of the urban Institute's housing finance Policy Center she says homeownership is also the primary way most people build wealth to secure their retirement and pass on to their children\nSo we want it to be available to those that are able\nTo sustain Goodman says while there is no ideal rate of homeownership it probably should be higher than it is today if credit standards were far too loose before the crash\nWe are actually way too tight now\nShe estimates more than six million people could've sustained homeownership over the past few years but couldn't get mortgages\nI'm On a ship in it for everyone but it's for more people than we're letting through the door right now\nEmily and Alfredo Cervantes hope to get through that door
