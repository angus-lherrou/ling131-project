between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time creating a especially the best course ever created\nOn how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a\nParking spaces are empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on to eat and briefing books when it open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to their central Florida family more information including locations that Eileen Dole health dot com slash kids\nEnterprise give us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about [noise]\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo there's jock there when the day after election knowing shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons tax up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyists who was they're mainly to\nRoot out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves and and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later I cannot assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people\nGenerally had the impression that\nHey ... trumpet especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department of commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in this book you right there is an upside to ignorance and the downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in his administration and the way it's running the government that it's looking for a loss of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term\nAnd I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit a\nSo those are people who have made a career out of people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named ... family and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that barn I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that no\nWell first let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going\nHer husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this too active destruction would come and kind of ease or paying she wouldn't have to stare at the bar and any longer and which he doesn't imagine is with the same tornadoes that's going to come take her bart is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works ... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government\nIt doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure\nOf the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis whose new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California Governor Jerry Brown signed tough net neutrality regulations into law\nAnd the train station has filed a lawsuit in California last clashes with federal policy tomorrow here from the professor who came up with that term net neutrality you can ask your smart speaker to play NPR on your local station tiny [noise]\nAnd you're listening to Ninety points out the news that five twenty eight I'm Danielle prior\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from Newberry homes accustom homebuilders serving the greater Orlando in Daytona Beach areas model home available for viewing and puns and look the key gated boating community located in beautiful ...

the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but\nInevitably he face Kavanaugh questions among them given how partition Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president there sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question well you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question whether Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stretching the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices\nBack then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or

the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one\nAnd the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is a four to four time would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse
