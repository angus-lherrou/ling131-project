NPR News Rocco Syria [noise]\nA couple of years ago scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nMost widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word that kind of look like Tobar own bars they're stretched out ridges set extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would as an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt playing at that point from the perspective on main such a lock on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis\nThey still maintain that they had found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bad that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News\nOr it it will be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example were analysts say that the cost could exceed a hundred and fifty million dollars if there is a hard to break that as it were\nA hundred and Fifteen billion while NPR Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reporting from Brussels thank you sir oh You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies have for the U.S George Parker has written about this she was a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program color\nIf there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe real depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a tightly chaotic an acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very bad judge and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have a and B if you'd have checked some old goods coming in and out of the u._k. which doesn't help for the moment that will quickly to choose cues or the ports coming into person\nAnd very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken damaging upside for the British Academy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency plan and getting on the u._k. and catch this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's a fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nThat will be quite bad and the pursuit told me we'll talk about that is\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines ... place where there are ... you could have she's running about ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so\nSo there are concerns that will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the port so pretty serious such as hard as being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate of what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of post you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type of the borders and that without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years\nThe u._k. economy would be about ... percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as akin to sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing hide you in Reno to immediately but over time person will be a poor placement otherwise it would be\nSo those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's somewhat and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nHum you name it they will they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries\nBut the point is this a symmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of the new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or the sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all ... of the ... yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago\nThe differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she that has to ... to have very divided policy bucking London and I think how she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think what basis I'm Still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the

found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues that one to two percent\nBut the wrong kind of apology could decreasing numbers revenues that went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to it in the future and then the ... and do better because then maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and I as a result those those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm not in our data\nI think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability I think\nPart of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripted risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um that we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we have ... which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nFor them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied them entered based upon that\nSo just to persist that there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example as prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable [laughter]\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admitted they use marijuana legally and Canada who cares\nLens ... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nIt arrives or shaking\nLike somebody's trying to get in and the anti doors shaking I knew there were had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for when last\nDoors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road\nHigh winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite a few gates is the former head of FEMA at a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families many of them or just said that struck folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John history no structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that sort of the goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes on the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds seemed in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damaged it pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that will well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out ... yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher global warming or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and as a wedding recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be done it has to be proven it ... it is way the community is willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors home builders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as Florida considers how to prepare the panhandle for the next storm like hurricane Michael

News\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have ration it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it racist sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what ... missions has been showing in the past few days and it has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents donors missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of give this a Jewish applicants as well\nAnd sort of use of personal rating chart officially keeping on very slowly although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost at the front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nGuessing that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these various I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from the inner city public high school background and I do recognize that married guys need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at night in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities or research this is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of that sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever and they sort of benefit to that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions and instead focus on something like poverty\nThat has really focused on something like race I think it creates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race it's just not discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard and you are listening to all things considered from NPR News next
