California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was he's or several times this er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss can be so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of thing when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Ninety point seven W.

look at statistics of unrest from black men in particular versus Iraq for white man that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he has been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds and sort of those those are the actual details though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much he weighs that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as ... as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often disproportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact that intersection nowadays he is at the intersection of being a person's color black man and the intersection of having a mental health is a dirty and I think statistics and I think I Know that the show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person has a black man so I definitely think mental um how has something to us and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege empowered interest in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected on the issue the poverty that aren't as connect with the issue to mental health in certain areas in Connecticut and she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I hadn't been overwhelmed with ... with supporting and even the fact that then I had the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result as colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who I'm saddened by the time is a story that needed to be told\nThat's about a Kobe she's the sister she naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us on our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course apple assigned is is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know my family\nWhy I\nHad all the\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement or traffic stop I guess ... it's kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up steel is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to fire the behavior\nOf traditions of citizens and police officers ship which last year is that people are getting the legislation just focus on citizens were showed\nIt doesn't just focus on the video is really a kind of a such a huge for additional course content for both should have some at also pollution police academy what\nWill be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy\nAnd the fact that the blood of course as a minimum of two hours the video was just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to fix to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video\nIs as a primary your when you go back and Richard Richard up that's why we can do it but the purpose is to make certain we the fire behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the ... you know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and take care of who was cast in your your fried I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that use it sparked your concern here is an African American man and not get any countered with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you\nLet me as a question\nYou can pick it up and that's fine because anything that uh do should be able to withstand
