lot of passion and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as a new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe just had a chicken with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at Jefferson ville Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and

iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh let's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nManning's first emerging years had been working for myself for the three weeks worst in the ... start working at the store is approaching that come from a bird you received emerged from this [noise] I mean to bring the immigrants were\nStarted making seven dollars for hours you know you were going to be producing dollars an hour after November first\nReal excited about it because you are there wider used to refer quality charges for more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for sugar full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work there which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with um you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season and you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does a company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports in a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonus if it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were before\nSo I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase in the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nAny idea why why why do they now so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it but\nOne really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a spate of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activities up some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\n\n\n\nThis is NPR News [noise] [noise]\nFor Ninety

McDonald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people\nAnd all of those students were found to be justified and so there's this sense that there's this one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are the people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P than fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhat would you say some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist\nBut defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the fact that we're gonna have to shoot\nSupport for Ninety points on the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ...
