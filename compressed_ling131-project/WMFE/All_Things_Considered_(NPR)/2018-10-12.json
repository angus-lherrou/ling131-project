Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two times look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today might lose your body solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees are mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees were started\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and a half an hour yeah yeah I've watched it out\nThere's also in that area there's a cause where the links apple electrical in East Point together that was damaged now just single lane\nBut that said there is now a path with through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with\nPower company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a

pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nHis best or rent a small church in is mirror and western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had just failed military two and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and brunch and was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the ... turkey blames relate to attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr

is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[laughter] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why released him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric or to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... on said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough and us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that for incentives an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey and\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extradite him declared for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\n[laughter] thanks Peter You're welcome match NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\n[noise] we can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with candles reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos\nHad gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price two of the new prize of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since ... so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why our corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ...\nIn fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they\nWould not comment they declined to comment okay find out things down a little luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so there's always a wholesale cost of the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how\nNaive to think that's all that kind of afraid of is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in suit studies she got the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with swell food prices\nIs a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nShipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a lot of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it might be a woman in in the hands [noise] yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbout companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum ... see that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now they all have so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nTracking growing category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're free does went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat would form [noise]\nThat with

transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy country\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously\nNow one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents Greg Myre thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown up by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they did it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA problem is is that there is no sedatives conclusion other than the Russians face was defeated them to move to\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo so names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nThat his life free so they were traveling underwriters as ...\nTo a guy like Eric

intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise] when you look\nAt these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of Russia and use random Russian guys going through and kind

years since there last basketball see with him\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they find just one clear and being Carter\nAnd yoga broken after two years and so they've been out to a game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always at the\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'm going with a big part of the appeal but topping in with the players today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark\nTheir basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle training newcomer\nYeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year in life you had about ... percent of the legal issues was loud oh okay step in a combat that it's pretty tough to find a K [laughter] yeah you have they do have a huge budget an all out from the standpoint and they signed the talk Fifteen draft picks this year along with the door to\nCousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's the big part of how they're looking to make it back\n[noise] how big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is is a long shot to get back into the basketball she isn't it\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the bigger the bigger hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were drafted by the\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check up on Instagram they are unlike any other brands and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and then it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken that made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west and the more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look all the stuff in terms of high school kids they're watching lots and lots of folks who are working and they're really kind of emerged anymore and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing that highlights on his grandmother and like that but I looked up the other day and out of the nine guys that cold assigned\nHave six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's why this huge as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself or going out a couple of hundred thousand dollars and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts in a big part of their strategy with their news that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and stuff so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n[laughter] ... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN

resignation is a necessary step a given what the rangers uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually checking his comments about the need for greater

Reserve next week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today\nThank you for having me here also [noise] so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush\nThe president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members of other decision makers\nBut not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hike\nI think it was always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always enough it needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes [noise]\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis ... information using\nThe institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or I\nThink is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks\nAnd others drawing ham and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see an economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution much acting in their best interests\nBut you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the marriage that could could overtime German power\nCeases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure\nIs understanding that
