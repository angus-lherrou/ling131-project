M. S. it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising called fire with Dr and this is how we do it now have you been to the family\nDoes your support all uninterrupted programming but donating a dollar a day the W. M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicide seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being a band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonesty physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud\nAround her whole valley\nWe were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know picked up by your bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes it different\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a decision between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAs she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first\nAnd also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the tide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers the bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms\nWith a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... in the lunchroom taping note cards to all\nAll the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend\nOur friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her son the crowded wall\nSupporting them to be a positive because I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just to point than say what they're going to if they don't feel like getting I clearly\nHas brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing the blues sources of strength ... with the words hope helps Frank displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's got to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing it what's\nGoing on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem\nLike suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having 'em up here or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was kept in numbers high school's football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes or husband or ... dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well\nYou have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing things that need to change\nKids are catalysts to change Morris says you start there and hopefully the community will follow Kirk Siegler NPR News Grand Junction Colorado [noise]\n\nAnd tomorrow on MORNING edition we hear how the killing

possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the president do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake of democracy oh geez that\nWell I think uh the president's message I gather more information ah it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the ... death as the worst cover up ever\nThat's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think right a sense when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of the United states\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nYou know we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's a ... something that has continued with this administration recognizing that the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners are they provide as valuable intelligence\nBut I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined is the Saudis\nAre Deceive Us and as they engage in a violations of our fundamental values as they strongly appear to have done a in this instance and they could show be killing\nRepublican senator tidy young I mean deanna thank you very much

selling quickly and home values were rocketing up but now it's a very different picture the housing market is weakening\nHome sales have been falling prices a few appreciating but at a slower pace\nLawrence is the chief economist for the national association of realtors he says this is not a mysterious situation the fed has been raising interest rates after a long stretch of low rates as the country recovered from the great recession\nThat means rates for thirty year fixed rate mortgage or now closing in on five percent for the first time in years and that makes it more expensive to buy a house so you would expect to see a drop in sales and that's the only reason sales could be slowing that sharp increase in home values it has consequences\nYou and says in the booming housing market prices are rising too much too fast and\nPrices gain eventually fifty percent over the past six years what people's income growth barely rose above ... percent\nThat mismatch was pricing new buyers out of the market with that in mind he says a slowdown in sales is not a bad thing if it leads to more sustainable price increases and for now home prices are stabilizing\nAs for what's next that's that is expected to raise interest rates again and it's the economy remains strong and jobs and wages continue to rise ... says the housing market could be fine with that\nCan you asking
