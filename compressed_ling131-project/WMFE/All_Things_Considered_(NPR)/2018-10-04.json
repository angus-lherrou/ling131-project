Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city governments sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand

it looks jarring but in person it's completely an spectacular people bustle on their way to work cars zoom by just another New York city street\nA lot of new information has of course come to light some symptom of has written responses came and let me let me let me ask you this basic question\nHow is it not in everyone's interest especially judge Kavanaugh's if he wants to clear his name for the FBI to given to be given the space and time to run all credible current allegations to the ground\nBasically the agreement was that we would take a week and during that time the FBI had full availability to do what ever they felt needed to be done and that was being made at the request of a group of senators who still wanted more information\nMost of the individuals who did not a plan to vote are the ones that are saying delayed again look let's be honest this is a political maneuver on their on their part\nAdvice look the story behind says is the Senate is supposed to be advise and consent and in this particular case they're strong feeling up here that Republicans are the Democrats Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission from day one\nYou're raising pilot and just let me and then they put out just on that and the moments we have left because differently when William ... absolutely they agree that says about politics that says Republicans trying to get your guy confirmed before the midterm election\nOh I think there's a lot of truth to that we've said number one we would do it normal ordered a we were up to I Believe in Ninety One days now right and the average at about sixty for about three weeks past the normal for the last five United States Supreme Court justice\nSenator rounds thanks so much you bet Mike Rounds of South Dakota and we'll be speaking with a democratic senator elsewhere in the program\nI Want to bring in another voice now one of the people from Kavanaugh's past who has stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination Chad letting them went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says that used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants to Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath Chad letting and joins me now Hi there\nHow are you man I I'm All right thank you for your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released a statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me touch straight to what you did with this information you ended your statement saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you\nDid you uh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for ... for them to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the presumed reviewed and I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces of bailout\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows I did not I was never called back I waited by my food by my computer uh looking to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is a central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all the good ones should lie in front of the so usually committee or whether it's taken an oath and what is also trying out in this case it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of ...\n... the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think Brittany to confuse that was passing out but the black phrase means doing things that you don't know if you've done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who hadn't talked to ... on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\n[laughter] let me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened to me last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three maybe four to eighty five year college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're going to

O. J. wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here\nThe new indictment done include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which begs the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again and one unusual things stood out this morning that the ... actually a warning for news media both here and around the world\nBe careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in this case\nNPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes of just a handful of senators they are weighing that decision after getting a look today at the FBI's report on the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh one of the most watched senators and that group is Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children has been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ...

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\n... from the earth the moon grows within the rocks paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth how much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different\nAnd it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer and looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves [noise] was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did it take you to convince yourself well\n[laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates a amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to cast where we can prove whether or not the men actually formed in the earth's vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act\nIt left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became in the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and it creation\nOr something it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe're you become a kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars [noise]\nI had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nFor you is studying climate to fall back to actually traveling through space to laugh\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] there are Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and two day she was named to the new class of MacArthur fellows congratulations and thanks for talking with us thank you\n\nFor Ninety eight point seven unit open enrollment for Medicare runs from October Fifteen through December seventh and there are lots of changes this year that will create more health care options for seniors Medicare Advantage plans are now allowed to offer benefits than include Neal's transportation an in home care\nHealth News Florida is fully ... speaks such a manner regional president Deborah Galloway who begins by describing some of these changes\nThe Centers for Medicaid and Medicare services have allowed Medicare Advantage plans\nTo cover a broad array of health services and really look at a Medicare member to improve their health and human ah um have been able to look at seniors from holistic view\nAnd understand that if your food insecure you're more likely to have chronic diseases so we added a benefits\nThat will allow a member of the men in the hospital off forty meals with meals on wheels after discharge or if they have a chronic condition they'll have meals that support the nutrition benefit of that members chronic condition also within that too is it that member is\nSocially isolated a lonely we've also noticed that those members how much more likely conditions of being hospitalized so but we also added to that benefit is that from a clinician standpoint they\nRecognize that that number is isolated we added a loneliness visit to that so that that member would have a person actually talking to them and meeting them while they're having that meal\nVisit to this isn't what you would traditionally think of as doctor visits or medical care covered by Medicare\nWe had supplemental benefits and what's happened is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have allowed us to increase the services that we are able to add to those benefits there's also another benefit that that it's been added\nThere might be an opportunity for a member to have a in home care services covered along in with their Medicare benefits [noise] um we also have added to our regular core playing\nTransportation unlimited transportation is really so that those members can access their positions and also go to fitness centers because we understand having that\nHealthy lifestyle support the overall health of member\nThis is only for a Medicare Advantage plans is that right\nThat's correct so what happened is that members plan they would need to look at the benefits of the plan their additives supplemental benefits to Medicare Advantage\nThere are also increasing access for tele medicine that can help with a doctor or nurse visit also mental health care can you\nTell us about that yeah so this year they've expanded and what we can do from a tele health perspective and for our ... members we've added a tell us Ike benefit in that benefit is virtual so not only would members be allowed to have\nAccess to be a Web but also telephone to visit the amount of psychiatric doctors and physicians in the area is limited and so really having that extra support and help at the time of need is really what we're looking at adding\nHas there been a problem providing these services in the past or has there been a vacuum of these services\nFor Medicare it wasn't considered a benefit so we were not allowed to offer those um now do the the new rules and regulations Medicare Advantage has been allowed to support um having that tell us how does it\nSo and I believe even in twenty twenty they're going to give us a bigger opportunity to 'em and proved that benefit\nBut I understand there's also an option where someone can choose a plan and if they decide is not right for them there's a window where they can change that can you\nUs about that so they added back\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been
