granted\nUm I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with black women who delivered that ... to that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc\nIt's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color and twenty sixteen team at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\n... he's the entire labor family we show up what is\nWay\nWhy why do\nWe know\nAnd that list of issues important black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up map incarceration and criminal justice every election\nCycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that's why when we ... we had a

whole ... years ... bills\nEvery man and the whole but these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything or be a bird's resented the implication editor zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like ... all your resources and all of your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics [laughter] so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black woman running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as a relief to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity injustice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWe'll just leave me ... is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls ... several organizations that are not a CBC a directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back but I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking

attention\nCan you describe how Gabby came home and the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen Andrew tour by the c._e._o. of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks after the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally\nTour but again went on a media spray asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally it's a third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nAnd want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gap CEO Andrew tour by about ... hours post when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you expect us to do it like that you want us to just censor anybody that's a phrase ongoing in that what you're proposing here and here's the thing he answered the bad or he beach harbor you wanted to find that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all\nYeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be president on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTrolls cereal harasser as people generally opt out not many people go on line to defend against these kinds of post that get served through gap and there is no counterpoint that says this has heinous\nGathered down as we said for now Web hosting company's paying that companies app store as

latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and allegedly scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either right first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\n... a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged game last week alright involves a woman who said she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's office was you know it's usually very tight lipped but I Do decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nIt's okay but do we know anything about this purported clocks\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of events ... earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she hadn't been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller so allegations that would date back to time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused to cheer if you use the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to us\nFor Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nMuller in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWork you know I see okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme\nTo pay a woman to make these claims against smaller Berkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember\nAround the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six arming a a theory that has since been debunked some other news organizations are covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman treated this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from other\nThe bottom line here in this whole regular regular moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged game to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller very weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nEbola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's ... item and explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to end\nLast month the usual ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nReykjavik appear young I was on the rocks are somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child on the phone just shut down a boy is seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching as the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nDo long shots of always father he rushed and on and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant that he immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn going on and it was from Vermont to be greater murdered be now you're just here's a worse you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing here will provoke grounded ... they're also trying to get out before someone throws the first round because you know once that happens for everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people in scary plastic suits\nBut there's another issue she's ... is a senior analyst with international crisis group the local population is very distrustful of the government even to this part of the DR see how a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor and he believes the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious it for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not have the central government nor a United Nations peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapping doesn't children\nAnd so says put on winning ... from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even real you know whether they're true your motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he pulled the responders are forced to hunker down\nAnd includes health workers who would normally be tracing any when he was had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the operates down the production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence anti are the\nSort of very unlikely that peacekeepers in the outbreak down right now the UN's main focus on the deer see our elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of that the un has to shift its pieces on the chessboard\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country [noise] how's workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...

dictate they should be so how true and and you know I mean it's unfortunate but I Am confused always by the people who say I don't vote or I'm not going to vote it's just it's remarkable to me\nThat in a democracy where we have this I mean it's been hard fought I mean I guess people don't remember but\nLots of people were allowed to vote right in the early days and\nAnd I went on and when they you know the church does something or the synagogue or mosque there they want to vote there for me to make their voice heard there right so you live in a country it's bigger but you're also of her social responsibility now we're getting well the three of us I can say very very candidly and\nClearly that the amount of the revenue the rabbi are going to vote we continue to do it we practice what we preach and so\nWe're going to continue with this conversation about the idea of voting and faith please stay with us we hope that you'll be encouraged in this election season will be right back [noise]\nYou're listening to friends fucking fat on me and my ... from the most [noise] subscribe to our podcast from your apple or Android device at tycoons pulled Google Play pop\nJust search for friends talking faith and never missing [noise] coming up we may or may not believe that faith has something to say to us about whether we should vote or not but does it tell us how we should vote will talk about that [noise]\n\n\nWe are back talking about voting in the United states we're just one week away from the mid term elections let's talk a little bit about faith and whether it gives us any guidance on how we should vote rabbi there's a lot of people think\nI'm that their faith tells them exactly how they should vote your thoughts about this\nWell I think in general that if faith is all about giving us values and moral guidance\nThan certainly faith should be one factor in making our political decisions I think that\nThere are certain issues in Judaism for instance Judaism is pretty clear on imagine is your faith about immigration just the whole idea now we'd get into specifics there may be differences but I Do want to say you know immigration restored if justice\nGun violence there are very specific moral positions that Judaism takes in relationship to all of those issues but here's the caviar to both of those things first\nOf all it is open to some interpretation as you get deeper into the subject as you know there might be a general principle about immigration but then you talk about\nIllegal immigration legal immigration so one thing is that religion can have a voice but he doesn't have to have the same voice because religion religious leaders in religious scholars have different interpretations about what the tradition says sometimes they all agree and sometimes they have a difference of opinion so that's one thing\nThe other thing is the question that every person has to ask is how much does my religious values system intact my decision in other words someone might say when I make a decision on a political issue religion may be a hundred percent of my decision making\nAnother person may say well it's eighty percent of my decision making and then I ten percent is my personal experience and ten percent is what my parents taught me so what I'm saying is that yes the answer is yes but with a few cab yachts\nAnd mom within your understanding as a scholar in Islam you're thinking about this question does Islam tell you how to vote\n[noise] well it tells you how to live and the vote should reflect your life your principles\nThe the goodness that us fire for for yourself and others and um you have to include in that I agree with the rabbi uh your morality and your principles guide you\nAre but you have that ... that\nBeing inclusive of other people\nBecause when you live in a democracy human pluralistic society you want\nFor others what you want for yourself and you want to respect the rights of others\nAnd you don't want the policy of the government to match exactly with your faith and exclude everybody else's face because that wouldn't be fair and you don't like that to happen that the policy align with somebody else's faith and exclude you\nAnd say you know you're going to celebrate only the holiday of sun so not your holiday\nOr allow these people to practice their faith in public and you cannot\nSo when you live in a democracy in you have a multiplicity of faith in customs you want to be inclusive\nThat's part of the deal and as long as it doesn't violate your right to practice your faith and it doesn't violate your principles of decor where you are not in a situation where you have to compromise your faith and your beliefs as I say churches\nNever tell you how to vote do they\nHave it's really interesting they did not used to [laughter] and then we had the advent of what was called the um when when the moral majority came along there began to be these little tools called motor guards and I would get a call from folks from that\nPart of the Christian traditions saying we'd like to bring by the voter guides for your congregation how many would you like and that sort of I I I never took any and then here's why I did\nBecause they were framed in a very um\nLitmus test the kind of way about how you vote so it wasn't a conversation here's the litmus test does this candidate believe that um you should have rights to everything in terms of firearms and then there are good vote 'em in in their in this particular framework\nDo they believe that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances than there are good vote that and all this kind of absolutist thinking and um there's lots of big conversations going on in in all of our traditions about all of these issues\nAnd certainly in Christianity multiple as you said both said there's a multiplicity of fought even within our own tradition about these things so the idea of a litmus test and how you should vote because they've checked the right boxes on some little um surveys\nFor Ninety point at a news comes from our land out how to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six outpatient contains more information is that kids are Landau house dot com\nOr really be looking at the question so\nSurely Christianity should inform you\nAre absolutely right absolutely so the way that I think is not the specific little issues that people get all very focused on\nBut rather the big principles of the Christian sites as you've talked about is it about love is it about justice is it about compassion is this about helping our neighbors this about taking care of those who are in trouble or who need our help like in immigration rather than just having this this kind of blanket policy\nNo immigrants or very draconian kinds of methods\nCase by case there are people right now I think in our\nComing to us for help as the United states and we've always had this policy of trying to help pride I mean that's we haven't always done it well but we've tried now it seems we're our policy is that we're not going to try to help you um we're just going to send you back it as a matter what's happening\nIn your home country doesn't matter if you're in mortal danger we're just going to send you back in that breaks my heart because that's not a Christian values that's not a Jewish value not an Islamic value it's not a fake value of any faith that I Know that we that we like send people away and put them back into danger in fact\nAs you said rabbi there's very specific statements about how you treat the immigrants and it's like laid out clearly within Islam Judaism and also in Christianity so\nI mean I think we can pick issues but I think what you're saying which I completely\nFollow is that it's the bigger values that you informed the way you vote not necessarily that a\nDenominational religion takes a position on this particular thing and the other thing is what I see all the time it drives me crazy as people always validate the weight of vote by scripture yeah as if that's the same context like\nTwo thousand years ago when someone's dealing with the situation it can be applied directly to today and here's a piece of tax to tell you how to vote that that seems to me\nTo be ludicrous unless it's something that's relevant today in those general values like love a passion understanding taking care of the stranger and we can extrapolate those pieces attacks but not directly to an issue\nIt's called it's called proof texting a and a lot of people use it a particularly I Know in Christianity I mean I don't know about your traditional but in mind there's a lot of folks using it to say okay because of this then ... that's what you have to believe and it's never that simple I Will tell you never that\nSimple just one week
