broke my ankle and coming up on the program we'll talk with case Stephen ... author of the book stories of the south race and the reconstruction of southern identity Eighteen sixty five to Nineteen fifty\nReconstruction does live on we are we're living with it today a in a way that I think people may not even that it would be aware of [noise]\nWe'll discuss the documentation of the stool wild Florida My father and son team a W And Julian ... in Nineteen oh wait\nThey were trying to chronicle a way of life that was quickly changing by the end of the nineteenth century into the twentieth century\nAnd we'll talk about the Melrose ladies literary and debating society all that ahead on Florida frontiers [noise]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nCase Stephen princes associate professor of history at the University of South Florida and author of the book stories of the south race in the reconstruction of southern identity\nEighteen sixty five to Nineteen fifty we spoke with Dr ... just before the sixth annual ... ... lecture on Florida history and culture at the University of central Florida where he was presenting on the topic reconsidering reconstruction\nRegional national and global perspective reconstruction is traditionally identified as having lasted from Eighteen sixty five to Eighteen Seventy seven but prints advocates for extending that date\nI Do yeah uh I mean there's Eighteen Seventy seven is absolutely an important moment I think we need to to take it seriously both as a sort of political watershed as well as a symbolic moment you have if you look at the press in Eighteen Seventy seven you have people commenting on this is the end of an Arab is the end of reconstruction\nBut one of the points that that made in my work and then I'm going back in my my remarks this evening is that there are a lot of continuity used that stretch through Eighteen Seventy seven and if we allow ourselves to be\nTo sort of taken with that moment as an end point of reconstruction we risk missing those longer continuity um so they're ride of issues that simply aren't solved a and an Eighteen Seventy seven feet the\nFate of the civil rights political rights it's a treat people the relationship between the sections though the role of the federal government and I think to to at least as a thought experiment to to think in terms of the long reconstruction\nA sort of changes our perspective on on the post civil war period and enriches I think both you know the\nBy taking a longer view those twelve years between Nineteen sixty five Nineteen Seventy seven suddenly become more than just to sort of passing fancy or an aberration they become sort of indicative of a lot of conversations that will be happening over over the longer stretch of time\nSo this is not something I expected to necessarily you know filter into textbooks necessarily but I think I think it's worth at least considering what happens if we if we don't stop our story of reconstruction and Eighteen Seventy seven and then carry it a decade or two you're further on\nIn his book stories of the south race and reconstruction of southern identity Eighteen sixty five to Nineteen Fifteen prince focuses on popular culture as well as politics to increase our understanding of the reconstruction era and beyond\nWhat stories of the south really does is it tries to combine what are generally two separate historical conversations one having to do with race politics and reconstruction the other having to do with the re fashioning of of the identity of the south I'm after after the civil war [noise]\nAh so I argue that what you see in in the fifth year period is really a national conversation between northerners and southerners between African Americans and white people about\nThe nature of the south what this place is what it has been what it will be what his role in the United nations will be [noise]\nUm and argue that you can't really understand the story of reconstruction and particularly the long retreat for reconstruction with out simultaneously paying attention to that larger conversation about the nature of the south\nAnd sort of by its very definition that has a conversation that's happening in a much broader venue a ray of uh Venus than than simply you know the halls of Congress and presidential addresses and the places that we usually look for our stories of reconstruction [noise]\nSo uh tonight for example in I'm going to talk about an event that happens in Brooklyn New York in Nineteen Ninety five where a a theatrical promoter builds a southern plantation hires about five hundred African American actors to play laborers on the plantation their status as free orange slaves it's not entirely clear\nIt isn't going to get it no matter what happens in Eighteen Ninety five in New York and to me how can we not include that sort of event yes it's yes it's theater uh yes it is it is\nA sort of peripheral bizarre spectacular one off kind of event but on the other hand to me that if I told us everything about the distorted long retreat for reconstruction the idea that\nA northerners would have been interested in that event and an Eighteen Ninety five the idea that you could sort of a race the story of emancipation by creating this this timeless a southern space in Brooklyn\nSo I think you know turning to popular culture turning two sources that traditionally don't make it into our stories of reconstruction really as an opportunity to to enrich where we where we have to say about the period\nThat's not to say of course that I don't look at congressional debates and presidential speeches I think these things need to be considered in\nIn in tandem is is really what it is to to be one without the other is to to miss the significance of both I think\nThe promise of reconstruction\nFor Ninety point haven't even gotten some land out how whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many athletes care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urging can't location and forty six ... ... ... more information is that he's done a new house dot com\nThe date of reconstruction\nIf you're looking for an end to the reconstruction story I think it is the rise of Jim Crow which uh is in its infancy and the Eighteen eighties it's by the Eighteen nineties but it's really a you have the the systematic stretch has been of African Americans across the south\nYou have to widespread a establishment of segregation statutes and the nineties and the first decade of twenty century is also going to be the peak of racial ensuring I'm\nSo to me that that's a more logical moment to sort of consider as an end point uh for for the the sort of along the rich richer reconstruction as opposed to that Eighteen Seventy seven moment\nIn addition to the production of black America in New York ... looks at many cultural expressions of history and his book\nSure absolutely I mean the black America is only the the Eighteen Ninety five sort of plantation a theatrical event is is really only want of of any number of of sources um [noise]\nSo in other places I I spend time looking at travel narratives um both offered authored right after the civil war and a whole bunch written in the Eighteen eighties northerners you travel through the south and write if their experiences and and sort of explain what this place is\nA popular conversation to have a whole chapter that looks at a sort of popular depictions of the Ku Klux Klan and the carpet backers as sort of\nTwin poles of a conversation about the shortcomings of reconstruction um what's really going wrong in the south is at the violence of white southerners in the guise of the Ku Klux Klan or is that the corruption of of you know so called adventures who come into the south from elsewhere [noise]\nUh I look at a plantation fiction written by Tom ... Chandler Harris a Charles just not an African American author who writes unimportant sort of counter works to those a famous white southern authors of a plantation fiction\nMore widely I look at menstrual see um city to black America story is part of a larger sort of change and and the tradition of blackface minstrel see\nEr which gets its it started before the civil war but it remains extraordinarily popular through this period into the Eighteen eighties Nineteen nineties in fact I think you see some of the most interesting developments in that theatrical form during and after reconstruction um do we tend to think of at predominantly as a antebellum sort of form it definitely it definitely last [noise]\nToday we would consider the debt mix to be early conservationist right\nYeah I Would think so AWOL particular through his writings again he he kind of entered this world he left Wall Street became a millionaire left Wall Street he traveled out into the western United States came to Florida as a hunter as a fisherman\nBut slowly he he began to change his mind set and as he said in one of his stories he he lay down his gun and picked up a camera he'd rather shoot the wildlife with the camera of course with the gun and and this is at a time and the beginning twentieth century when folks like Teddy Roosevelt\nYou know our champions of the modern conservation movement so these are the the forefathers if you will kind of of that movement and they were a big part of that in Florida\nAnd their photographs or a testament to that now the glass plate negatives were donated to the American natural history museum there were three thousand photographs that are part of their collection\nThey were recently kind of rediscovered in the archives and were published in a series of books one just features their portraits of the seminal Indians which for ethnographic reasons is incredibly important\nBut then they have other photographs of fishing and hunting and and the people and places of southwest Florida that's are important for historians but also for environmentalists kind of studying what Florida was like at that time\nWas really fascinating book Thanks Ben sure I think you ... is director of educational resources for the Florida Historical Society and archivist at the library of Florida history and cocoa if you'd like to see some of the debt makes work that we've been discussing check out our Web extras at my Florida history dot org\n[noise]\nWhen you find your through long\nWhen you\nGrow\n\nThem fly through her so uh [noise]\nI'm Meg Corey or oh\n\nWords you have never ever grow ones you\nHave um [noise]\nUh\nIs Florida frontiers highly Baker is a public historian with the University of central Florida she has this look at the Melrose ladies literary and debating society Dr Cynthia Patterson\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nEighteen Ninety nine and article that was published in the fall twenty Seventeen issue of the Florida historical quarterly her interest in Florida women's club and the progressive era\nCame from her earlier research unsettling clubs from the nineteenth century some circles where a lot more about political reform activity and then they were about sewing\nMany of the sewing circles eventually morph into literary societies Dr ... investigation of literary societies in the late night teeth and early twentieth century led her to the story of the Melrose ladies literary and debating society\nThis group arose in Melrose, Florida very small community still today in Eighteen Ninety and it was one of what would come to be hundreds of women's groups in the state of Florida\nBy the mid twentieth century and the cop was actually founded by two northern transplants\nA woman named allies the king\nAnd her companion Nelly Glen and they had relocated to Melrose using kings small fortune that she had inherited from a deceased father and spouse to invest in orange groves in the state of Florida and so they got together with six other women\nAnd the eight original members of the Melrose ladies literary debating society met for nightly that is every other week and they met in the homes of members most of them lived in Melrose year round and so they held their meetings to plan\nActivities related to reading to writing to debating\nAnd also to be engaged in the reform activities in their little village of Melrose\nMelrose ladies Larry and debating society for one of the first women clubs in Florida it was also one of the most radical ones\nThe Melrose ladies were a little bit more radical than some of their sister clubs were in terms of at least they're reading material they were talking about sexual relationships and at the age of consent for women\nThey were talking about the lives of black Floridians\nHow to improve them they were talking about prostitution in the state of Florida and how to put an end to it and I did not see evidence of that kind of debating going on in the other clubs who's\nRecords I've examined the male ladies literary and debating society when the head of its time Dr Patterson points out that they're concerned about the rights of women were similar to those expressed by women in the modern me too movement you could\nActually draw a line from their concern about the rights of women and male abuse of power to today's contemporary me too movement\nI don't think it's a far stretched to see that they were already\nAsking these kinds of questions and concerns with these issues of the rights of women and male abuse of power then that now or in the media today I think it's important to note also that most of these women's groups are still in existence today\nAnd still meet in their original meeting house as does the male risk group\nThe same one they arrested and the Eighteen nineties\nOver two hundred group still belong to the Florida federation of women's clubs\nAnd that's just the way the clubs for white women there was a whole other organization the national association of colored women's clubs\nWhich was also very active beginning in the Eighteen nineties these clubs are still very active in leading reform initiatives in their villages towns and cities\nThe story of the Melrose ladies literary and debating society showed that they aren't Capitol Records of society than clubs can be used to uncover the voices of women in Florida history\nThis is a good time I think to put in a plug for saving and preserving\nThe records related to women in the state of Florida I have read the leading text books that purport to teach the history of Florida and there is very little in there about what women were doing I suspect that one reason for this is that\nMost of these women's clubs records are held privately they're held in the homes of the secretary of the club in the clubhouse or storage unit\nSome of which are not climate controlled I was fortunate that the records of the Melrose ladies literary and debating society had been donated to the University of Florida otherwise\nThis would not have been known to historians I Would urge our listeners to think about the preservation of records particularly records\nRelated to women and what women were doing in the state of Florida and what black Floridians were doing\nFor the most part you simply will not find that these kinds of records have been collected and archived in libraries museums university archives so the the challenge of preserving these histories is very real\nFor Florida frontiers I'm Holly Baker radio and podcast producer with the public history program at the University of central Florida\nYou've been listening to Florida frontiers the weekly radio magazine of the Florida Historical Society does it at any time on the Web at my Florida history dot org\nAnd join the conversation on Facebook that lord of Historical Society\nProduction assistants for Florida frontiers comes from ... Robert ... and how we make\nOur Web extras are produced by jury climb the program it's edited by John wake\nUp a great week I've been broke Marco [noise]\nFlorida frontiers the weekly radio magazine of the Florida Historical Society is made possible in part by the department of state division of historical resources and the state of Florida\nIt's also made possible by the Jesse Ball dupont fund the rocks at her house museum in gardens galley and by Florida's Space Coast office of tourism representing destinations from Titusville to Coco beach to Melbourne beach\nIn the Carolina mountains I'd see undue tuition and their displays of beer and Fox isn't dancing bears and that kind of things so let me talk a little bit about if you would about the uh the roadside attraction a\nAspect of a boost\nYeah sure I again I feel like it's a indication of how we are evolving not in biological terms of all things about how we're evolving in our feelings and understanding about animals and how important they are and how\nThey live on this planet with us and have all of the sensitivities and needs that we're starting to understand better and certainly when I was little that wasn't part of a a big\nWorry with these roadside attraction and having animals taken care of certainly some of them probably did but the knowledge that we have now of what these species are really need to thrive on test exist in human care is\nLight years ahead of even when I was little so having animals available for people to get close and inspired by I think is more important now than ever but the care of those individuals needs to be at the absolute highest standard possible\nWe are just attracted the animals we our animals and they are just fascinated when we see these creatures that we may not see everyday\nBack then and certainly now even more removed from wildlife um we only see it on television or in print and we know now science tells us that's not good enough to form these connections\nThe interest in these creatures was it's been clear like you just walk us through time\nHas been clear um we we love them and\nSometimes weird ways these wild creatures and now we're having the understandings base in science on what they need and\nHow do we provide that and still make the connection between humans and animals um which back in that Greek and\nRoman era of the world is pretty healthy from an ecological standpoint now\nNot so much so we need that connection more than ever and more urban we become more powerful these times where you share the same space in the same air and hear and see and smell these creatures starts to make that connection\nYou know thinking about it I mean it's kind of like the phrase you don't know what you've got till it's gone right so when when the world was a dangerous place in nature was overwhelming humans and humans had to struggle to survive in nature than animals were expendable but now as we become rarer and their habitats become rarer\nAnd as we are more educated and more conscious and\nMore aware we appreciate the more and more some kind of still walking through kind of the transition you know again the the college you lose right so I'm Still kind of tracking up to the modern and the kind of thing you were just describing you know again as in Miami and I remember you you were talking about the um\nOur our desire to be close to animals as opposed to just seeing them in the Internet on YouTube or whatever or on TV and I remember things like the parrot jungle in the Miami serpent Terry him do you remember those\nAbsolute so they're like random Park Zoo yet right out in the ... so you know but especially in the parrot jungle\nYou know you would get to have a pair of sitting on your shoulder and that kind of thing and and the ... there were I remember that vividly there were some full of rioting snakes I remember seeing like a hundred snakes meeting and they were just\nWriting together in this nightmarish way and they also then part of what I guess his name was bill hops metal lived a long long time became famous\nFor doing this kind of thing but he would um milk poisonous snakes but they're ... they're as part of the entertainment but they're also then selling it as anti venom and say there was a useful function that he was doing their part of the entertainment but\nBut that was all a fascinating and those weren't\nToo bad but back when you were a kid I was wondering when you went to those places Margot did you think gosh some day I went to work in a place like this I mean did it inspire you\nIt absolutely did you know having the luxury like you did have growing up in Miami I had the Everglades the keys\nTo the beach is at my disposal I you know when you're a kid and you get to spend time out and wild places you may take for granted and I certainly did but the other piece of the puzzle was when you're out of the keys in the Everglades you sometimes run into animals\nAnd it's exciting when you go to the zoo and aquarium\nYou have these intimate experiences that are super rare in the wild and I absolutely fell in love more by going to those places than\nIt was already in my DNA that caused me to go outside and\nLook at frogs in my backyard [laughter] um so absolutely they were part of me growing up and falling in love with nature for sure\nFortunately for the world of animals here you've got deep into it you're listening to American variety review and under whose court Lewis we're talking with Margot McKnight who's the executive officer a\nI guess that means that executive director of the Palm Beach zoo and uh she's been a in a similar position and other zoos in an aquarium and er and ran a wildlife a network that it was trying to to uh I guess do a contiguous along the zone of\nWildlife friendly land across three countries so that was a big undertaking\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health is dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that too early no health dot com\nOne country safari or the humans are in cars driving through the habitat rather than the animals being in a cage and humans walking through looking at him and so is that\nYou can get through all of them in that that may be a kind of precursors of the big issues that have a lot of land and and what do you think about kind of been you\nWill the space that the animals need to actually thrive under our care is going to be dictated by their behavior and their ecological needs so a place like\nLike countries safari that has animals that need a lot of space and move around a lot I think that's a really innovative way to actually see them\nThat that works for that type of animal I think really well\nI'm walking past is another way to to have big open expanse of animals can actually have all of their behaviors that are so important and specific to that species to me having this base that the animal needs is the very most important thing you need and then how do you create this interface between the gas and the animals\nSo some animals don't require that kind of space are very different space like three top living or\nIn the water or having water inland so\nThe appropriate habitat that the animals super comfortable and is the most important thing\nSo a drive through aquarium would be hard [laughter]\nUm but I Love the innovation of creating different ways for people certainly some places pervert zoo is one um Disney's animal kingdom where you can actually go on a tree top kind of ropes course and the animals you know what a what a memorable experience that is going to be\nUm some of the species that are a little more sedentary are easier to see up close and a ... a great example they're not giant travelers and they're super comfortable you know with their eucalyptus trees hanging out close to people so [noise] um it all depends and that's what these are really great at now\nIs figuring out for the climate that the zoo is in the species that they\nCan create great ecosystems for and great guess experience that's that's definitely the way of the world now\nI Know in the in the river glued to the some years back to the to randomly mentioned that you started a number of innovative things one was a a ... tour I guess you could pedal a kayak through an ecosystem like you're describing and see the animals on the land while you're in the water on the kayak and that was unusual certainly for a small world isn't\nSo that kind of thing or just you know in a way of sort of like to learn to safari only you're in the water and their land and you know again it's kind of simulating being in the wild\nSo you get bad experience on top of just the mere animals and experiencing the animals for different dimension writers are\nExactly in the whole idea of getting people away from their TV screens computer screens out of their cars getting them immersed in natural areas is what\nWe're trying to do and um the kayaking through an African habitat is super memorable and son is also a physical so the great thing about visiting a zoo or an aquarium is that you are actually getting a dose of nature and now there's a lot of science that\nTalks about how important that is for our I'm not just emotional health but emotional physical health\nThe nature deficit disorder that was\nUm [noise] I think championed by Richard lives book and then\nI don't know if you know about while as Jane Nichols and the blue mind about water and and how important that is for health so not only visiting as you are aquarium um we haven't even talked about the conservation work we all do 'em but not only does that um connect you with nature and it's interesting and educational and helping to save the\nPlanet the animals but you actually get huge benefit from that and the more we can make it these beautiful\nImmersive natural areas the more important it is especially to urban areas so you'll find most zoos and aquariums in urban centers which is where they're going to have the biggest impact on the human population there\nOne reminding that human population of the rest of the planet but also a dose of healthy nature and really bonding with the people you go with and seeing other people and not\n[noise]\nSupport for Ninety seven news comes from aggressive the planes as a family owned company that
