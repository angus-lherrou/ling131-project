the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go\nCritics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse\n[noise] President Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details\nAbout that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary move us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban and he'll give that his government emergency powers when
