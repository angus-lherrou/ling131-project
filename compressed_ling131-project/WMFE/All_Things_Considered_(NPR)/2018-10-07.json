S.\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get a visa the only way that would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow figure out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Bruce ... he was embarrassed or to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand seventeenth he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global ambassador thank you so much for talking to us well it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you to have the best does\nNow to our series on China's growing influence in the world that influences felt particularly strongly in that in Latin America where Chinese investments are growing rapidly it's often said that Brazil provides the suit on China's dinner tables from soybeans to beef and chicken those expert helped make China Brazil's biggest trading partner\nAs NPR's Philip Reeves reports Brazil also has something else the Chinese want\nHe said\nEnd up playing soccer under ... afternoon sun again and you'll notice that something different about this guy we're in Brazil you all the players Chinese\nTeenagers who've come here eleven thousand miles from home to pursue a dream\nAnd letting the new doctor be woman in her own [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from Orlando Sentinel information about home delivery of the land though sentinel is available at four zero seven for two zero five three five three four on line at Orlando Sentinel dot com slash subscribe\nTo president evangelical supporters are working hard to get out the vote November but concerns about moral issues have inspired believers on the left said to the polls is\nOne of the reasons I wanted to be part of that if a you know I Believe in Jesus Christ and I\nBelieve you know\nFor the latest on all the cabinet under that's on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR [noise]\n\nStart your work week with MORNING EDITION weekday mornings beginning it's six right here on Ninety point seven F.

I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager at local McDonalds\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year\nAnd policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant the fed the ... percent but then when you look at those numbers are we talking about for the something off he says investors said there's something of that\nSo from my perspective it's really what did I Know ... why this police officers were killed in the line of the you know we don't know exactly what died in there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhere they're at some time that we as saying that is dangerous an disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if\nYou look at the most pressing yes we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer and meditation\nAnd we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas I handling and all presidents with the mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer than most frequent reasons I'm for that [noise] I mean you're saying\nThat they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it as it were\nThat people who for simple police officer says the nominal the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police on the top press that lift her by a racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years because of that on the policing and so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plastered triggering event\nThen you have the the cuts us off it out on so somebody's looking\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a

location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that Eileen Dole health dot com slash kids\nSomebody looking at police officer says\nIdentify them as part of this complex mend it thought that the government that that demonstrated thanks so it doesn't take much to take your anger out to the police officer because the kind of take your and get out to get on a given politician instead you you're doing it against that so that prevented me from the government as a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with the\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement town best and the ones that are part of the um ... meant that affected that this is definitely\nA training in your office that's like when they sit in a car and the police kind and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that that\nIt's always the reasonable thing to do given that particular environment and given that in political development that might be putting their life and then jak so\nThis is how you approach and the ... house oh well you know that if the fat that\nQuiz armed and dangerous it's we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have a ten thousand police agency you cannot Institute stand up for recruitment stand up for training which would help I mean the the negative perception of of policing is a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there is also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's up to talk on the acceptable\nThat nine off he says the new one year are killed in that line of duty as an outcome move to meditate detective because it was
