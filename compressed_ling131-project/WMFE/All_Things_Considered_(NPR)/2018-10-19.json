were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumbled prosecutor's office as\nCritics day from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in Saudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes you're writing well ahead of the Turkish team\nUs based turkey analyst Soner trapped I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel the Turkish president Recep Tayyip air to one needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nI think at this stage a Turkish president on can take nothing less than not just a complete apology but ah someone pretty significant an importance thrown under the bus\nPotential candidates for blame have emerged in the media suggesting an effort is underway to shield crown prince Mohammed bin ... from responsibility\nPersian Gulf analyst Simon Henderson at the Washington Institute for Near East policy says turkey can ignore the show was engaged to a Turkish woman and that would ever happened took place in Turkey despite the diplomatic status afforded the Saudi council it\nIt doesn't have diplomatic state just in order to torture and cause a a visiting citizens\nBut Henderson says the question of what turkey wants is likely to be overshadowed by what could play out between Riyad in Washington\nThe U.S has counted on the houses out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market Anderson says that move could now becoming at an awkward\nMoment November for foods when sanctions on Iran or increase the game and the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market about took the movement that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... said something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves [noise]\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those right around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor\nAnd they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly\nI think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work could show she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the purported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation it's\nI mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence\nAgencies you're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of that investigation is it a binding could Saudi Arabia could be us just decide to ignore or whatever you find of\nCourse they couldn't ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think\nIs a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible\nIt'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't it happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for\nHolding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included states like France\nUm those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special rapid return on freedom of opinion and expression thanks very much thank you [noise]\n\nAnd not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say they'll say um\nHow could you be a Republican when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics it all support immigration\nReform and his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latino safe the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district at the knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was only Rivera must be a Republican running for reelection hum I'm here to answer any questions they may have objects including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali separating\nFamilies isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nThough one like no I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI ask for their out if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now this sounds\nLike a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my condition [laughter] that position is that I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear from Republican governor Doug ... who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you the if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection a stubborn you see on the ballot but it's Doug do Caesar gender\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them for you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah\nWe see what's going on to see how they treat us in\nOur film IQ if you've got to vote you got to go you go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go where they're over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all

was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails with city I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really lucked out reading and sharing stories as a doorway conforming relationship usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized teen wise about projects especially those that had been doing it for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nIt tell me about some of the places where the libraries and our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up this

community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he stood out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what
