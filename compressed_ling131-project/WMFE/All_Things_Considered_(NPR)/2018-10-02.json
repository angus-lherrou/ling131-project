should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so she decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization he started to something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment and that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about support for people who have pie TST how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out of the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who's disclose their sort of thing except usually on the you know\nOn the tail of a scandal is going to come out involving some uh misbehavior but I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistics saying that suicide has increased especially among cancers generation of veterans and candor

largest company to commit to the minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is where it's almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this year at a meeting salary at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family for NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before and more than seven\nHundred workers in California warehouses and told them they are getting around\nDave Clark he told me this was one of his best days at work and the Twenty years has been at Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR sponsors I reached Clark adds that California warehouse\nWhere we're announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum made before any other\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower or ... or was just under eleven dollars and it ranges over Fifteen dollars\nThis was already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest man in the world CEO Jeff either [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of the speech and Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside bays and spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful ... said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage base those said the company let's send it to its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's as soon as a matter of what I did the right\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe but I'm ... years and will cause other companies like Wal Mart a fast food industry or something like that which was also a good day for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make it public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco hit fourteen dollars in the summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news and see how could be other than good news\nIt offers an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decide to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste day it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to push for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number for really for Congress but\nSenator Sanders says he hopes the ... stamp of approval convinces the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is

violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia but he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection\nTwice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct the third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things about the state six to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia it's so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet and his cell for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely your innate sign himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia rendition so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas cove and junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia are delusional\nLawyer go then replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible\nCrime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from

impact our culture and it Shapes Our views a route [noise]\nCan you tell us some of the stories that shape our American culture\nWhen one in particular when the folks who founded the Boston colony we're coming over\nOn the ship 'em their leader John Winthrop preached the sermon he was not actually a preacher buddy preached the sermon\nAnd he spoke of America the new land as being a city set on the hill he pulled that right out of the story of Jesus preaching the sermon on the mound\nAnd him talking about your light and he said uh who lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel basket but if you lie to lamp you put it on a table at lights the whole house and then he goes on to say a city set on the hill cannot be hip or in other words um\nYou will be seen by the world and this was what was being suggested is that this new land is going to be this city set on the hill now that had to do with the way that we show compassion\nAnd care for one another unfortunately as some political operatives have taken that up\nThey've missed the point of what that man\nAnd instead to kind of got into American exceptionalism and some other things but but really he was talking about how we are are going to be a beacon of compassion and I'm concerned for the world and helping the world so it's a but that certainly was one of those kind of defining stories\nTold and drop by you have many stories to tell 'em that you see every day being quoted by a American politicians and you see that coming right out of\nGenetic history or how did you see that uh the Bible or the Toyota had influence American culture with that story\nWhat's so interesting about these stories and mom is that\nThey began as stories from the toll road from the Old Testament and then they were sort of adapted to be American figure so that Abraham who wandered and he was a rugged individual becomes Johnny Appleseed\nYou know the Israelites that wander through the desert in form of people become the early American settlers\nAnd friend you know the exodus becomes a symbol for civil rights in America very much tied to the African American community during the fifties and sixties as they struggle for civil rights and others that worked in civil rights the whole idea of\nThe Israelites being redeem from Egypt from slave to free became a very powerful\nMetaphor in a very powerful message and I think it's still resonates actually in the African American community that story so\nThese stories began as particularly Jewish stories and then they were adapted to the popular culture even sometimes as I said\n... given them American cultural names and figures you know Pocahontas and you know the the stories that we have it in American history are certainly certainly often transpose from the early biblical stories and I think that they still resonate\nIn many ways the themes that runs throughout\nThe toll rise in the early Israelites being a democratic society and everyone having a vote everyone being counted in the senses of the Israelites that every person counts every person in America counts and the list goes on and on and on through that adaptation of these stories to American culture\nYou're right I see that especially the the story of the African Americans and the civil rights movement in the sixties and how Dr Martin Luther king junior really\nAs a minister a used the story of the activists and the story of most of the dollar federal said my people free\nAnd uh the songs that come in and we shall overcome it's all you know is higher out of religion out the scripture to modern time to shape American culture into\nA you know bring this biggest uh achievement the or liberation and the\nQuality of a African Americans or people of color in general in American society and it's all based on stories that we're told and retold so when Dr King was using those stories he knew that\nEverybody white or brown or black they were all heard that story it's rather with them and now he reshaped that and customize it to the amount of time and said you know you've heard this story this is how it's up by today that's why he would be that and indeed um\nFor any point in the news comes

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nOr for a reason and I remember ah the first time I met the rub I hear a\n... it was in a Martin Luther king you know celebration and he brought the story of you know the land of milk and honey and how we as a society can build a great society by giving equal rights for everyone\n[noise] you know as you're talking about that a a mom and rabbi as you're talking about the\nPowerful story of of the exodus and all that that means about moving people from slavery to freedom and the whole issue of justice and I'm transforming society into a place where everyone has equal rights and an equal protections and so on\nI think of that what I Believe to be kind of the Lynch pin um reverse between all the came before a in terms of the story out of the Hebrew tax and all that would come after him that Lynch fan is the text that says\nBut there are rows of pharaoh who knew not Joseph\nWho didn't remember who Joseph once he didn't remember the story and I'm fearful ah and concerned that we may be in such a time is that right now in America\nWhere we are forgetting who we are who are called to be and and the essential values to guide us as a as a nation\nIn the stories powerful stories from religious ... that have been told and retold shape our American culture today and impact how we see the world and that's why we read them that's why we go to religious places every week to listen to these stories and hear the reinterpreted\nTo our modern time we have a lot more to come with the place of stories in our religion and our culture please stay with us [noise]\nYou're listening to the three wise guys on rabbi seeming will\nRemember subscribe to our podcast on your apple or Android device that I ... just search for friends fucking faith that way you'll never miss an episode\nNext each of us will share one of our favorite religious stories and we'll talk about why we think the world needs to hear that story especially right now that's coming up please stay with us [noise]\n\nSupport for friends talking faith comes from Florida Hospital for more than one hundred years improving tomorrow innovating today the new Florida Hospital for women life is amazing learn more at Florida Hospital dot com [noise]\nAnd we're ... speaking about religious stories and we're not going to focus on a favorite religious story from our tradition\nThat you feel the world really really needs to be here right now I Am on what would that religious story be", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "02"}
