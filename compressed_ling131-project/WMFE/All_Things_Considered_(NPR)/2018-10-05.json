Supreme Court and I'm very pleased about\nThe numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony um answer questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament it temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said she no longer believe ... should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs into a room and he should have been from when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo American cities or not he said she ... she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar\nWho know him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as a family that he would have acted like a comment on I\nHad by the way he acted like a ton of time\nI think that response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man with expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has announced standing judicial temperament and he will Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim as a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForward sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal belief and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the on a you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question\nThat he found the some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee to be appropriate but when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respect the separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had her ... moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back to or break he apologized to senator ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of biking women's strengths were kidding gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats ... you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum that just had a political tinge to it and I I not focus for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you [noise] to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court

employers they can't find more earth that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says does historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... could implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFour point ... percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening late\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment down this load people benefit disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs or at least recently not able to get jobs the market's open up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate you had a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate the White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who is senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates are said you know when it's getting to have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people in the fed and many other economists they would have started to slam on the brakes she'd be unemployed got around five percent or they never would've allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n\nAny point seven news I'm Danielle ... for forty farming support for Ninety points other news comes from Gen spring

hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I've started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around on the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story on your right none of us knew what was going to happen or maybe some thought out into the world\nWe did and my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times with doing bigger investigation sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on foreign factory workers\nBut you never know what's going to happen to investigation what when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt pretty\nLike to say as we were working on it he said hurting wine skiing is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and Iran maybe D.C he really was not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which were handed years ago by trying to\nTake off globally but it just kept going and going and going there were so many times in the past year when I hopped productions that this was going to\nBurn out or you know the women were authentic Samara Cameroon or the news was

he was confirmed anyway\nAh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of any to hell\nThe other argument however

that kind of college geology is stressed when you have a candidate who comes to board with a background of this sort of a confirmation process it's not that the court can deal with it but it will make the court more visible\nDoesn't mean they have to come out from underneath always rubs doesn't mean that suddenly we're going to have CSPAN or that they're going to stop their very small group
