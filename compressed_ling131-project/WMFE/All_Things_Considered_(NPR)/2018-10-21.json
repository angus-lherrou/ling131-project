with these types of mad because it shows the evolution of land use and how that's changed\nAnd we'll talk about Florida's first professional football team the Miami Seahawks all that ahead on Florida frontiers\nSpeak um none of the Senate and house representative yesterday some seven Nineteen forty one\nAge they live in infamy United States of America was suddenly as liberal find naval air force base of it and buy a ban\nWithin an hour of this speech delivered by president Franklin Delano Roosevelt on December eighth Nineteen forty one\nCongress voted to bring the United states into World War two the war had a major impact on the growth of Florida which is reflected in a permanent exhibit at the museum of Florida history in Tallahassee Bruce ... is senior museum curator\nThis was an exhibit that uh the Ford apartment of Veterans Affairs\nWorked with the museum on it was two thousand of four we installed this exhibit and it's part of a larger project they had that included a floor to World War two heritage trail the three dimensional a floor to World War two a\nMonument out in front of the building and then this is the museums component and um as you say a Florida those\nRole in World War two uh really transformative a Florida was relatively rural area before World War two large influx of servicemen for training during the war or industry like ship building occurred\nAnd by the time the war was over we're looking into getting into what's considered modern Florida\nDuring World War two Florida's population exploded Key West at Thirteen thousand residents in Nineteen forty and forty five thousand by wars in five years later the population of Miami almost doubled to more than three hundred and twenty five thousand\nFlorida became a training ground for American troops\nWill we begin or exhibit looking in emphasizing a military training in Florida because that was one of the key aspects of uh what was going on here in the state\nFor instance naval aviation and a U.S army a air force or aviation work key here there was a huge number of bases an outline feels Florida's mild climate flat terrain that allowed for a year round training for aviation\nSo that's something that was a real concentration here in the state\nAlso in addition I'm here at like say a camp landing which is now a National Guard camp\nDuring World War two ah it said population wise\nTo have been the fourth largest city in the state and so it was an area that was training or both or infantry divisions and then individual a replacement soldiers between camp landing and also camp Gordon Johnston down on the coast at ... they had done a insidious training there\nBetween those two bases\nThe free a significant a U.S Infantry Division one short Normandy has some of their training here in Florida so it wasn't just aviation a ground forces were also a very active in training in the state uh down in Daytona Beach\nUh the wax the women's auxiliary corps was developed a training base and that was partly as a result of a\nNoted African American educator Mary McLeod the food and had lobbied a President Roosevelt to set up a whack training base and so from Nineteen forty two to early Nineteen forty for a large number of uh women trained here in Florida\nThe world war two exhibit on permanent display at the museum of Florida history in Tallahassee includes informational panels and displays of uniforms photographs and artifacts curator Bruce Gratz\nSome of them are representative examples aware of a a infantry soldiers fatigues a Web belt uh than we also have some photos of a\n... century military classes that trained at camp landing and are they even have something like a souvenir pillow cover that uh soldiers would buy and then send home to sweethearts as a token of where they were a training here in Florida\nFlorida's participation in World War two went beyond serving as a training ground for soldiers immediately after the United states joined the war German submarines began attacking supply ships off the coast of Florida\nUh in the early months of the war pretty much about the first seven months of Nineteen forty two was a time where German U boats are submarines for attacking a allied freighters or that we're going\nFor Ninety ... news comes from our land there how are they now Arnold Palmer hospital six children have been caring for the children and teenagers in central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including more so rankings horrible online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nEastern coast so ah quite a few uh tankers and freighters were attacked and sunk in Florida and this was before they were able to get a affective a naval escort and a convoy operations and eventually and later a\nNineteen forty to determine is pretty much pulled back their offensive in order to uh\nTo concentrate on defending Europe but for the early part of the war um there were instances like off Jacksonville where civilians would see\nA burning tanker and even the the submarine surface\nSo it really brought the war home to Florida\nIt was not uncommon during World War two to see men working in Florida citrus groves wearing clothing marked with peas and double use indicating that they were German prisoners of war Bruce ...\nThey were brought back a first from the north African campaigns also for some caption or does submariners and then eventually from Europe and Italy\nAnd uh they were put to work many times like picking citrus ah they had them stationed in POW camp set up particularly around like can't blending\nAnd uh as I've mentioned before that Germans were captured and brought to Florida we're considered fortunate as opposed to Germans who were captured by the Russians and take in Siberia\nSo um they were held in bases around the Florida and even held in Florida for a while after the war ended or just because there was so much a displaced persons in Europe and so they uh took a classes in English and uh American values\nIn addition to the German POW clothing the world war two exhibit at the museum of Florida history includes a variety of American uniforms worn by both men and women\nWe tried to be a particularly careful to include all of a major military services um there's examples of officers a uniform\nFrom a U.S submarine commander who'd received the navy cross\nAll the different types of soil and the ground that's underneath these areas what's important and\nWe think about urban development as well because all these buildings were built on top of different types of soil and you know larger buildings may not be suitable for a certain type of soil so they they had to kind of take that into consideration when planning eventual growth of some of these urban areas\nYou know when we think of of Florida we think of sand but it's also interesting to note that there are probably ten or twelve different kinds of sand that these maps identify\nAnd that is right now keep in mind this was published in Nineteen oh six so you mentioned yes ten or twelve different variations\nBut the science has actually evolved quite a bit past just at the ten or twelve variations in the sand and different types of soil so these early maps are certainly still important for those who were involved in the\nStudy of soils but again the science has changed so much that does classifications are are essentially moot they're no longer a ... to the types of soil so who uses these maps nowadays\nWell as I mentioned before a lot of the locations of buildings and railroads trails which became roads later on our our present on these maps\nApso historians find these incredibly valuable because much of this infrastructure is now going a lot of the railroad systems no longer exists in the state of Florida\nThey also identify I'll take for instance this map of Franklin County Nineteen twenty seven you'll notice here there to pick acts as a ... indicates the location of a phosphate nine at least ... no longer there but now we have an idea of exactly where the mining operation was you can see a spur rail line that was traveling to that area\nThat's all been changed and that's incredibly important for urban planners for\nCommunity members for politicians for\nThose involved in of course again in agricultural production but even homeowners anybody interested in the history of land use for a particular area\nWould be concerned with these types of mad because it shows the evolution of land use and how that's changed and in Florida and the last hundred years with such a rapid amount of development in the last hundred years or so these are become vitally important to understanding the evolution of Atlanta [noise]\nThanks lot then sure I think you Cindy be Aussie is director of educational resources for the Florida Historical Society and arc of is that the library of Florida history in cocoa [laughter] [noise]\n\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of make the point that it's W. M. S. it's been a for two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising called fine with Dr and this is how we do it now with the family\nDon't your support and interrupted programming donating a dollar a day with him after that or or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\n\n\nThis is Florida frontiers the first professional football team in Florida was not the dolphins or the jaguars or the bucks\nAs Robert cast an aloe from the University of central Florida public history program explains it was the Miami Seahawks\nTeam was located in Miami and it was a team was called the Miami sea hawks and they were part of the all American football coach prince conference that was organized a Nineteen forty four\nOr by arch ward who was the sports editor of the Chicago Tribune a new ad in was the inventor of the baseball's all star game as a college all star game uh in football\nMiami was obviously not a big lead town at this point it turns out Miami was the smallest of any of the studies that have done a ups the franchise it turned out also that in the end it probably did not have enough fan base to support a corporate taught him\nThat was Dr Richard ... author of the NFL football history of America's new national pastime\nHe smoked me about the Nineteen forty six Miami Seahawks the very first professional football team to call Florida home the Seahawks we're part of a short lived all American football conference or the AFC there was a rival to the national football league\nThe Seahawks only lasted one season Dr ... tells us why this new league and team emerged after World War two\nProfessional football was still at the margins the NFL was that the barge runs the AFC certainly was at the margins what what what the founders of the league we're looking at it in the late forties\nWas their belief that coming out of the war there was going to be kind of prosperity in America are and that that prosperity would generate more leisure time and more leisure time could be transformed into more organized sport as entertainment\nAnd a lot of people who invested they ... AFC and some of the people who were investors in the NFL were looking to make some money then they're always those people who get into professional sport because they're looking for exposure to promote themselves to sell their own ego and certainly that was involved with some owners as well\nDr ... tells us why they struggled\nWell I think if they had a winning season they might have they might have survived I don't think they were ever going to make a lot of money because of the city just wasn't picking up you just weren't going to draw that many people talk to people were going to go watch football they were probably going to go watch the Miami Hurricanes\nAnd you had to give them some reason to come to watch the Seahawks Seahawks didn't have any big stars they big players so why go there initially they drew twenty five twenty six thousand fans for the first couple of games\nBut they were losing almost all the time they lost seven out of their first date games and the fan base just disappeared a and the second half of the season they were drawing about nine thousand pants\nThey will end up facing bankruptcy at the end and uh they couldn't get enough money to keep the team going\nThe Seahawks had a difficult relationship with the Cleveland Browns\nOne of the things that really hurt them initially they had to play their first three games on the road and they have to play their first game against Cleveland\nAt the Cleveland Browns and it turns out the Cleveland Browns what's the best by far the best team in the new league probably the best team in professional football\nCertainly by Nineteen fifty they were the best team in professional football but many people would argue even in forty six they weren't that good or do the opening game they lost I think forty four to nothing had was downhill from there they say\nLater in the season when Cleveland came to play Miami at home the game would be no tore it for the racial climate that was president in the city\nCleveland had two African American players and when they were scheduled call them play in Miami\nA and one day where they play it of course the first game in Cleveland against Miami and there was no issue there but when they were scheduled to come down to Miami to play first of all the the Miami ownership notified of the Cleveland Browns and Paul Brown that they they should bring their African American players\nThat there was a law in Florida against interracial competition to sport and they would love to play\nAnd there was a good deal of consternation and browse organization about what to do and whether to challenge the U.S\nAnd in the end I think what persuaded them not to bring the players was there were a number of threats that came to the players from people in Miami\nAnd then the and Paul Brown thought to you know this was not going to be a difficult game he didn't have to have all of his players they're going to win easily and why risk\nOr why put somebody at risk but for that and so they didn't bring their players are and so it's one of the new one of those in another little interesting dark moments in the history of segregation in sport at a time period when sport was desegregated\nThe NFL desegregated the Nineteen forty six uh and and essentially what day of she never had to desegregate because they never had segregation they got African American players from the piano [noise]\nThat was Dr Richard ... and I'm Robert ... with Ron frontiers\nYou've been listening to Florida frontiers the weekly radio magazine of the Florida Historical Society join his

broke Michael [noise]\n[noise] Florida frontiers the weekly radio magazine of the Florida Historical Society is made possible in part by the department of state division of historical resources and the state of Florida\nIt's also made possible by the Jesse Ball dupont find the Ross in her house museum and gardens in galley and by Florida's Space Coast office of tourism representing destinations from Titusville to Coco beach to Melbourne beach\nFor them to get tickets and and I'm sure you're going to talk about he had a job he liked a lot it was helping the people that he had bought with I'm\nSort of a have job or get education and better their lives and he felt good about that part even though he was the early more and more uncomfortable with Castro's government\nYou're listening to American writer radio I'm your host court Lewis we're talking with Aaron shutter like who is the author of a book I'm into doesn't seven called the American oh\nAbout a guy named William Morgan an American who went to fight with Fidel Castro's a rebel forces against uh the dictator but he used to in Cuba\nYeah so we started living very dangerous way and this is where he was kind of the recklessness we talked about in the previous show comes into play he didn't\nGive that as much importance as he should've if he intended to save his life right so he became he really wanted to settle down at this point he's married as I mentioned in a had a couple of children and uh\nAnd he wanted to settle down and have kind of a quiet happy life in Cuba to begin frog farming and he actually already employed about six hundred workers and shipped roughly fifty thousand pounds of frozen frog legs on average per month to the U.S to use very successful and math\nBy Nineteen sixty is we were talking about he had become disenchanted with Castro so I think he began working for the CIA didn't he was collecting arms and sending them to rebels in the in Cuba were intending than to fight Castro is a tribute\nIs it's true in that one thing a quick note about profit from what's ironic about\nThe job at the front part it's technically he was working for the sake of I think that this was part of the Institute of agrarian reform so this was a state run business the Fort Morgan was running very sick\nAs you mentioned the city proper place else for this policy\nMitt sort of thing but you're right what happens is\nHe starts after that moment of choice earlier a couple of months earlier he decides to start helping the people who have gone back to the hill the form of due counter revolutionary group against Castro\nStart packing guns into Barrow\nAnd moving them out into the mountain now\nThe part about working for the CIA that I Would push back on just a little bit\nI had the adventurous experience\nOf when I was researching this looking Yuba of meeting Philip at age ... out of that name rings a bell that he wrote a book called a tell all the ... document big trouble\nFolks inside the company in Nineteen Seventy five but never lived in the United states and ended up living and dying and Cuba safety about Morgan and he said listen here's\nSomething you after a member just hurts you take out from the CIA does this leave your work there's no question that Morgan receipts from arms the different channels from the CIA but I think he was working\nMore for the people he thought\nAnd that he wasn't an instrument of the CIA so much as taking resources from them that he thought he could like you know just got\nSo one way or another though he is a beginning to\nCastro off royally\n... he didn't know if that inside your circle of bodyguards he had an formed a guy named the steel Castro no relations are freak out and it's really I was starting to hell\nDetail what Morgan with do it and so they were watching and they said he was starting to participate in some of the activity that he was talking against communism which they didn't like and they were watching this begins to happen\nAll right so then we kind of cut to the chase here Morgan was arrested in October Nineteen sixty finally and he was tried for I guess treason and imprisoned\nAnd shop on march eleventh Nineteen sixty one so there's kind of a long convoluted and and to some extent a contested a story about all of that he may have had a chance to escape but the plan fell through and so on but anyway he was executed\nBy the man by Castro who had supported and help to win just the two years before right then are you a shot in Ninety sixty one he was arrested in Nineteen sixty so there was a story that I heard and I don't know if it's true maybe you can shed some light on that as he was about to be executed he refused a blindfold he refused to to be handcuffed\nKeeps going to stand and take it like a man and they told him to meal and uh she refused meals and then a voice called out\nWho might have been Castro watching\nTo shoot him shoot his knees and they shot him in the knees and he fell to the ground and then they executed him is that true\nThere were a number of stories about Morgan last minute and all of them\nTalk about his bravery and I think that that's the central\nTo hold onto the story that I ended up\nMaking the most sense to me um and I have heard the story you just talked about that this is not right or wrong or you know when someone\nFor Ninety planes at a news comes from Orlando how are they end up health Arnold Palmer hospital for children have been caring for the children and teenagers to central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nThat actually hurt the what the ... he was allowed to command the firing squad\nAnd so he said to the firing squad\nAgain right know blindfold eat that\nAnd they gave us cigarette\nSmoke the cigarette down in that when I like the cigarette away ... [laughter] and you can imagine this moment where he finishes the cigarette eclipse that into the air and the fire and that's the ... century\nYou know so that that I hadn't heard and if it's true it totally fits the image of him as the kind of flamboyant you know kind of theatrical person that we've been describing here\nI mean if you see the videos of him he looks a\nColorful he's a handsome guy he's big and he and he has kind of a kind of a main glorious look about him is kind of pleased with himself so I'm Wondering what what drove him Mona reading something that did he sent to the New York times during his time as good as you say he was becoming famous in it and it's strange that\nHe's so little known now and that's why we're doing the show in part and that's why you wrote your book you were the first person to really kind of out him into modern consciousness uh in recent years but here's here's the er an essay he wrote to report or in the New York times who was kind of beginning to tell his story Morgan story\nWhy do I fight here in this land so foreign to my own why do they come here far from my home and family why do I get worried about these men here in these mountains with me because it because they were all close friends of mine no when I came here they were strangers to me I could not speak their language or understand their problems is it because I speak adventure\nNo here there is no adventure only ever existing problems of survival\nSo why am I here I'm here because I Believe that the most important thing for Freeman to do is to protect the freedom of others\nI Am here so that my son when he was grown will not have to fight are dying all am not assume because one man or a group of men try to take his liberty from time here because I Believe that Freeman should take up arms and stand together and fight and destroyed the groups and forces that wants to take the rights of people the way\nI mean that's [laughter] it's kind of a Tom Paine like declaration of this guy really ought to be famous as I said at the beginning of the first show on him he ought to be more famous than shake well Laura and yet he's been kind of\nDisappeared and the reason for that I think is a Cuban authorities suppressed the history of his role in the revolution after his downfall because they didn't want him to remain the Robin Hood like\nMythical eroded that you described Aaron and and the CIA on their part made it all classified because it was the kind of thing they classified right and so for those two reasons he sort of fell into oblivion only recently has begun to come out of that\nBut I mean I Would ask you was he mainly a thrill seeker for ...\nOne of the things that I write about my book and you know I spent a lot of time thinking about it and you know neither of us did climate to William Morgan editors ... and take your out really\nTo make it\nTo our earlier conversation I don't think he ever fit in northern Ohio I think he was two boisterous who's to blame for you as you said he liked to talk with her and he likes to tell jokes and you first court and\nAll that he was around a lot of people that were like that [laughter] where are the actual clothes that were loud loud I\nSpoke with their hand and all of a sudden he found a place\nWhere you sit in for the first and I think that\nYou know we're talking about her in this profound what red and it's true but there was also that sort of very a motion for personal level\nWhich he connected with the people around it when I was sent all the time you buy Miami doing research for the book particularly in Miami but also in Cuba when people say that I Would protect them if they were going to say something positive out here\nThe people that he fought with lots of they trusted here\nThey thought that this with someone that they admired\nAnd so I THINK Team through that lens which I think is a really important lines as we try to figure out who was it really discovered himself in nearby and was fighting for what you believe that what he thought was right\n[noise]\nSupport for Ninety eight point seven news comes from Florida Hospital where they are committed to a

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nAnd you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never so I I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us were not there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed\nAnd so the kid went\nDown and he looks up to us any waves to us and he started smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulls honest than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on his shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us out at at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys are the party started touching another young woman who\nWas also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nLater a she was laying on the bed and uh what\nOne kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably didn't as four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told that your fault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and ... later on I was just plain guilty you when you deal the about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and I think why do you have a sense like why do you think that is why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't know I I I really don't know why men has been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward in a talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it\n[noise] how did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well\nLet let me tell you when I originally told my wife\nI told her just the rape part that I witnessed I did not tell her my participation she didn't know that to this article ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good\nAnd how did you explain that to your boy [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know that can you know we we can and can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our kids are\nThey both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now and they said everybody at that window would have had their phones out videotaping it\nThat's what they told but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they\nYeah I mean but in that sense that she wouldn't have done it because he wouldn't have wanted to be on film\nYou know we film everything you know what they were kinda looting too\nWell how do you feel now that you've got an off your chest you know [laughter]\nAnd I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there are there are days when I regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time some of it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually\nAssaulted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say the only thing I can\nSay is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if I buy help these women than that I didn't do it done hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many
