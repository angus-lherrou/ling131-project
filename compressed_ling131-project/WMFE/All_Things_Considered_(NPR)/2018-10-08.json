Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it

whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's gonna happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's an el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily Yara of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\n[noise] honestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore it really is to tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of Ben\nThat steady drumbeat to get Taylor's class to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she dropped his Instagram pilots that they really lengthy almost like a scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who've are honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said any so they kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is an disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free heard to take more left leaning political positions now\n[noise] I think it did it in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in Tennessee declared herself going to the top world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now or solitaire being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have the tractor a little bit and the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still on chip young then\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to\nShare opinions you know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure rating her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd it's just that I've been trying isn't the mystery of the day and I always had denied her mind for me it laid back like Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty sticky jak she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nHer her message after that she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd she didn't say with those were and I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her\nSexual assault trial when I got a music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her enemies in great line when she counters they'd him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\n[noise] Emily yard is an

lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's an algae beat she writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really surprised me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because I for the last two years there has kind of ban\nThat steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that they really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMidterms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million ... followers and a lot of people get really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything that they kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is an disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\nI think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now Herzog with her being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have a broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit and the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still on chip young then\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to\nShare opinions you know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think it's going on with her\nHands is what I've been trying as the mystery of the day and I always had that I had her mind for mislead Beckley Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's on with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after that she kind of looted and her statement to events that had happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd like she didn't say with those were and I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when it got me the DJ due to her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for
