support thousands of troops in war games of south of here tomorrow\nNow yesterday we saw jets ship's tanks from Germany the U.S Britain and Norway all and lots of other countries all coordinating a mock assault on the shoreline here\nWhy is NATO mobilizing in such a big way right now\nYou can't ignore the contacts NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counterinsurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be re focusing more on its roots aback you're in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country as a tactic seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume this fictitious invader is Russia earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the eastern and now it seems to NATO stir\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that there are no way where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape is changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James logo he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and she said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic was a few hundred so we may be challenged and so if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nTo whatever all so ago saying is you know if anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been for about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to the un Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground\nWant to see is down to the United states is increasing its presence military presence in Europe would more forces more exercises more pre positioned equipment for the first time they're also used Marines hated Norway\nKids with the message here is the United states is still very very engaged in NATO\nThat's NPR's Frank Langfitt joining us from Norway thanks very happy to do it or a\n[noise]\n\n\nAll things considered is

issues did lead to violence civil protests that didn't lead to blood in the streets\nSo I Do I Believe this is possible it's part of my own life experience and the concept of a civil war is seeping

work together with someone from a different identity group\nBut that's something we speak here in the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions\nThe way to prevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have been in their own lives is really taking the first step to not when you disagree with someone to listen first that job and again I think as you look at the U.S today we're entering a period of of conflict but you know even if conflict is
