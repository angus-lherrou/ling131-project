Warren and activists and no more deaths volunteer warned was taken into custody along with two migrants who received aid and shelter at the barn\nFederal prosecutors to charge Warren was harboring conspiracy to transport in harbor the migrants no more deaths use that as an effort by the government to crack down on groups providing aid to those trucking the desert\nWhat we see on the edge a now that they're going after the activists\nThat includes she says Scott Warren worst case take the twist when most of the desert into a federal courtroom because it's there that his lawyers have staked out a defense based in part on the religious freedom Restoration Act also known as RFRA\nIn simple terms a warrant is saying is that his faith compels him to offer assistance to people in need including immigrants Columbia Law schools captain Frankie is one of a handful of law professors who submitted a friend of the court brief in Lawrence case to help explain to statute here's how she

example allowing a religious group to using otherwise illegal drugs such as ... that is central to their observance as\nIn recent years Christian evangelical groups increasingly have used a lot to advance their causes\nAs attorney general Jeff Sessions has taken up the banner of religious liberty last year he issued a memo with guidance on federal protections for it and then a July speech he 'bout to aggressively protect religious liberty\nSessions created a task force to help the Justice Department do so one of its jobs just to make sure the cases the OJ attorneys bringing defend and the arguments they make in court aren't aligned with federal protections for religious freedom\nThat includes making sure our employees know their duty to accommodate the full of fame as the people in this room know you have to practice what you preach\nBut some say the Justice Department is failing to do just that instead they say it is selectively supporting religious liberty again Frankie\nThere is a public face of this government which is very protective of religious liberty and then the real work that they're doing is army protecting religious liberty rights of those who are religious conservatives\nNot or wherever it is\nThe American civil liberties union says the administration's view of religious liberty is selective in a different even hostile to face and religious people with which disagrees many conservatives on the other hand have lauded ... support for religious liberty\nUnder ... Warren has to show three things to make his case that his beliefs are religious in nature that they are sincerely held and that they are substantially burden by a law that applies to everyone\nIf he can show those three things than the burden of proof shifts to the government prosecutors have to show that the government has a powerful reason to apply the law in war and specific case\nThey also have to show that the government is using the least restrictive way possible to accomplish that\nThe government says for its part it has done just that\nSo what are Warren's religious beliefs I visited his parents marking Pam at their home outside Phoenix to find out\nFor a mark yeah\nMark and Scott testified about their beliefs at a hearing earlier this year they describe the life force that connects everything in the world\nIt's more than just ... ... isn't natured grand you know more convincing religions are about dedicating your life to some something larger than yourself and that sort of saying well this dedicate your life to the largest thing there is that's the universe itself\nAt the court hearing prosecutors probed mark and Scott and their beliefs to the war ends it felt like the government was giving their view short shrift as I talked with mark Pam spoke up from a couch and the other side of the living room\nAnd can't discerning what church do you do you go I mean one building one church is just brought it back to science can't happen religious church building right away I thought they were getting mocking\nThat the U.S attorney's office for the district of Arizona declined to comment on warrants case which is winding its way through the judicial system a district court judge denied his motion to dismiss two of the counts based on river grounds but the judge left the door open to warrant to try again to try\nRyan Lucas NPR News Chicago Arizona [noise]\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought oh Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base\nIn the industrial heartland a Trump and another problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there is a red wave and borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that's the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nOh All right NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nDemocrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIs deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump have you have the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for the country and one is good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I want to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county officials and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've done twice before just need to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump me a love for a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist\nGoing into Washington I don't exactly one morning when I build relationships on both sides of the aisle\nLove as aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during a White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right\nRepublicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes and actions not her occasional statements\nI don't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi and that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for below sea to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even the he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if that turns over and they went in the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back passes because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first a solution comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for a single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderate ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for
