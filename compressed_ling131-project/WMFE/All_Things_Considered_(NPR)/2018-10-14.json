broke my ankle and coming up on the program Florida has played a major role in the film industry will visit the former shamrock studios in winter park\nWe were here with the political junkie Tiger Woods universal release in sixty six sixty four and we did our interiors in here\nWe'll discuss Henry Flagler publishing company in order to attract people to Florida you have to advertise and at that time print advertisement was the number one medium and talk about the age of fear in Florida with historian and author Garry Moore me know that ahead on Law Order frontiers [laughter]\nThat's music from a dance scene in the Nineteen sixty six filmed Johnny Tiger where Chad ever it as the title character does pelvic thrust hip shakes and jumps with abandon in uh Florida bar\nJohnny Tiger is a seminal caught between tradition and modern society the movie was shot in central Florida including a shamrock studios in winter park\nFlorida played a major role in the film industry from the very beginning particularly in Jacksonville Rodney cabin work throughout Florida in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as a film director and production manager\nYes artifice secondhand ... who founded servers garden there was a walking encyclopedia of motion picture business and I had a lot to do is promoting the state of Florida\nAnd according to him and Nineteen eleventh through Thirteen or Jacksonville was a world wintertime headquarters of motion picture industry\nGoes just walk up in Fort Lee New Jersey which is where the movies were made it snowed in the wintertime so they came as far south as flavors railroad would go and at one time or eighty five companies working in Jacksonville and understand the Nineteen twelve of us and bring over a hundred million dollars gross\nBusiness most companies in Nineteen twelve money\nAnd a hell roast was there by a graph though that a lot of the little people\nBut uh it went because of two reasons first of all a lot of small companies that didn't bother to budget to try and they needed a fire truck going by they separate set up a camera on a Jacksonville St Paul fire alarm box\nAnd they do their car chases amongst the street cars without advising the street car company and that sort of upset the city fathers so they were not too friendly at that point but at that stage the industry was beginning to move west\nAnd that kind of ended a the big held in Jacksonville at that time\nSo Simpson writes about film and is president of the popular culture association and American culture association\nThe film industry did not begin in uh California as many people might assume it actually began in New York City and Chicago\nBut ah the early film industry did do quite a bit down south including in Florida and in fact one of the first early film studios was Kayla him and that was set up in Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd they did a lot with early silent film including giving Oliver Hardy his start in silent film so I thought that was a really impressive accomplishment Florida film industry back then and uh Jacksonville uh was initially it was quite welcoming toward the early film industry\nAnd in fact the mirror there provided a lot of economic incentives for the film industry to set up and Jacksonville\nNow in about Nineteen Seventeen uh the mayor had a reform candidate running against them and the reform candidate had pledged to do something about the disruption of the film industry was causing in the street from Jacksonville uh because I'm sure you know there's a lot of disruption that a film company causes and the normal\nDay to day or in any town also the sensibilities of some citizens were offended because the film companies would sometimes stage scenes in public on Sundays and that didn't go over well\nWith a reform candidate did win and uh so therefore Jacksonville suddenly was not so friendly to the early film industry [noise]\nAh there were other companies are in the early ... era in Florida including the norm in Seoul manufacturing company and they were significant because they are used all African American actors as their cast and this was her segregated audiences in Florida\nBut it did provide an opportunity for early black actors to\nPerform in a row is leading roles and it was a non stereotypical kind of role on so I thought that was also very significant to know about early Florida film history so the major film studios began to set up in Hollywood, California because that was a much more economically friendly environment for them\nAnd being moving away from Florida and other\nCities in the south but still there is a pretty significant early presidents in Florida the film industry\nAfter the major film studios moved to California following World War one Florida remained a popular place for location shooting\nBy the mid twentieth century smaller films studios appeared around the state and some were involved in major productions bruso Donahue is the owner of control specialists a traffic engineering and management company his business is in a building that used to be shamrock film studios in winter park\nWe moved into this building a Nineteen

he said it was pretty spectacular so that place was called shamrock studios and he says uh and I think they ended up making a movie and uh I've actually moved\nOut Hollywood so that was kind of fun and he showed us all around the building that this is what this was for us was that was for because he was part of that film at the time\nAfter shamrock studios left the building and the Nineteen seventies it was occupied by a pest control company and Palmer electric current owner bruso Donahue says the building design is clearly best suited for a movie production company\nThe officers in front of the buildings seemed to be sort of executive management style offices um this is a building that I'm not sure an architect would be proud of it looks like it just sort of keeps going like the Energizer Bunny I mean this is sixteen thousand square feet under roof\nWhich is hard to believe and when you said the warehouse which was really a sound stage and and again the bathrooms are not small bathrooms there are large because they were showers and dressing rooms so it's a big place\nFilmmaker Rodney cabin\nWe were here with the picture go Johnny Tiger woods your groceries in sixty

trains are running has he's wonderful reproductions of the line drawings of the hotels photographs of different hotels how to get to certain areas and towns throughout Florida\nAnd of course it was all done on the FCC railway but it was a guide for anybody coming to Florida\nAnd if we flip here to the back cover it says here the east coast of Florida is a paradise regained and it has this wonderful color image of the state of Florida that shows the rail line and at the very bottom you must be in a magnifying glass to look at it it says the record company St Augustine Florida which is of course where it was produced\nWhat we're looking at here is another color production for the season of Nineteen or one to Nineteen oh too\nWe also have this great pamphlet it was a guide to the out 'cause our hotel bass which was very popular\nEspecially in the Eighteen nineties beginning of the twentieth century people came to Florida really for the health reasons so they had these wonderful\nIndoor swimming pools and bass and these little electric shock treatment therapy centers and we have wonderful photographs printed inside of these pamphlets and again this was done at the record company but as I mentioned before\nIt wasn't only material designed for tourists we also have material that was designed for employees of the FCC railroad and and hotel company here we're

animals and also the kind of a funny thing that you know it's such a direct connection between that film and what he employer does so a few joined a circus he became a fire reader\nAnd he married the residents snake charmer evidence was a beautiful determining girl for a a a snake like Morgan so [laughter]\nI'm you know I'm I'm doing some of the Segway here because there's a lot of story here but\nIn Miami than he heard about this emerging revolt in Cuba against the dictator provincial ...\nAnd in Nineteen fifty seven Morgan decided to get down to Cuba to joined the fight for democracy so take it from here I mean how did you get to Cuba and how do you try to hook up with Castro's anti Batiste forces in Cuba\nHope circuit if you're such a strange in almost surreal part of his life I guess a lot of parts of his life on earth but yeah fire swallowing buried a snake charmer also around the time that we do need some work for ... and the mob down there which is the important\nConnection that you use the active\nBecause what where Morgan if that could you about it through done right into the rabble so while\nThe United states would not selling guns are obviously to the people fighting against the dictator fool conceal back east stuff out there was a great demand on part of Castro and the rebels in Cuba for gun and there were ... canals that we're providing them with\nUh some of them through Guantanamo I'm the U.S navy stationed there and then others through other means and the mob was provided a lot of the gun and so Morgan started you know healthy youth helping deliberately gun by\nBoat probably I'm from Miami in ...\nAnd I should interject or that for those listeners who may not know Cuba in particular Havana was a it was kind of like the Las Vegas at the time it was the was the party place of the\nOf the you know the northern hemisphere it's where people went to ah let it all hang out and\nKind of whatever happened to have an estate in Havana kind of thing and so the mafia we're deep into that and running the big night clubs like Copacabana and the Tropicana and so the mafia I had a major you know kind of interest in what was going to happen in Cuba and they might maybe one of the support both sides right so that's how she got involved in running guns for the mafia down into a into Cuban\nYeah let me set that moment just for a second\nI mean you're so right I mean literally worked Las Vegas before Las Vegas I mean\nThe reason Las Vegas because they have to eat out after a shutdown of Anna ... as the place where there's gambling in this sort of you know exuberance and no holds barred nightlife it take like in this moment you're up their their dictator will catch up on the staff who's seen our Nineteen fifty two\nAnd after that point Miami ... revolutionary activity trying to figure out what to do so it's no surprise at all to\nWork at a bit contact with that down in Miami during that time\nHe poured lean Cuba and plan how to get back to you about um if they were on the out whoever was leading us and that's do the right so you had a society in which there were more Cadillac per capita in Havana, Cuba than any other city in the world\nThe place where this extreme wealth disparities you had seven percent of the business owners\nIn you know was owned by America\nAnd so you had people who are frustrated by that\nAnd because of this activity will hit you but these are the dictator was becoming more and more brutal and killing people into ... people are even writing you know Castro name and\nSo you know this is a situation that Morgan Fox they give you a Thanksgiving fifty seven\nWhere it's at a revolutionary activity of people try to figure out what how can we take this country back from this guy whose whose brutal and a catering in their minds too much to the American\nYeah so he wanted to get to Castro Castro was in the eastern part of the country which is a you know his gang of insurgents basically and they weren't that many of them and they were in the Sierra maestro mountains but all of the rebels in Cuba\nWho were antiquities to we're not under Castro in fact there was a second group called the second front concern Morgan ended up joining in a second front in the ... mountains\nBecause basically he wasn't equipped with enough resources to get all the way to where Castro was so that was kind of a pivotal key thing and and Morgan's or what turned out to be Morgan short but intense a future in in Cuba so how was he received when he finally did hook up with the uh the rebels in the ... mountains on the second front\nSo there's some Eric and two is overweight dressed in a white in city shoe ...\nType stuff into these mountains lead us into the mountains and enter this

deal with here\nAnd one of the things that concerns them immediately and said they are doing these long hike to sort of recon whiter if you're out where the military is and they looked at him and they think Howard this guy going to\nBe able to keep up with us on these high and how much of our food is equally didn't have that [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I think also that they thought he was a CIA spot I mean there's a guy who did you say is like kind of chubby not fat but he's sort of a chubby older guy who's you know a overdress than them totally looking at a place in the figure that we may be rushing KGB or\nReproduce to undercover mercenary or some you know they figure he was very suspicious so they they didn't trust him at All right away to face\nThat's exactly right and the one of the things that gave them a little comfort on that front flip that he didn't speak any Spanish ... and they said well you know all these stupid enough to send us fire here who can speak Spanish so they were unsure but he has to prove itself that's what he ended up doing he ended up proving themselves by\nBeing courageous by showing them that he had some military training to actually make the better soldiers these guys have a military training whatsoever and began to earn their respect\nYou one thing that struck me as interesting was right off the bat and one of the things you do to prove that he might be on the on the up and up was that he drew a line on a tree and then walked off about fifty feet from it and took him ... through the knife and you stuck it right in the line and the tree and this is part of a circus training but then in ... I was like whoa [laughter] this guy has a skill\nExactly and I'm Roger Redondo who was one of the young men up there came back through the the would just as Morgan has arrived in Morgan is taking his shirt off\nAnd he saw this I said it\nWas so white us think the average theme was born in fact [laughter] and then Morgan throws the night in practice and then he goes through their meager collection of weapons and says you know which ones are good and which ones are bad\nAnd ah sits down with a lawyer ... yards but do you who's the leader up there and but now you're through a translator there's you know who are you in are you are on and Morgan as no for some time\nSo but no you decided to take this word that\nYou're listening to Americans righty radio host court Lewis we're talking with Aaron ...\nWho is the author of a book and two dozen southern called the American of about a guy named William Morgan an American who went to fight with Fidel Castro's a rebel forces against the dictator Batiste in Cuba\nAnd uh so worth pointing out how he's joined up with a lot with catcher actually but with a secondary group called the second front\nWho were allied against but the stuff with Castro but the politics of the group competition and mistrust between them came into play later too so\nSo they kind of flowing interesting story we don't have time to tell really in the details but er but certainly people can get your book and we'll talk about that at the very end but\nHe began very quickly to go from being someone who is ms trusted them they were about ready to shoot because they thought he was a spy Ware plans or some sort to being their commander and you know along with the guy you mentioned the ... he became like the ... commander of this a second front group and they began\nWith his training to win some battles against the uh the highly trained up between the military forces and better armed and all that tries\nTo he'd be the became a kind of a a hero to them over time because he would uh he was very brave as you said and and uh when they would go into battles were there were a number do they would win so talk for a minute if you would earn about his encounter with Che Guevara who was with Castro in the other mountains further east\nAnd and the whole process of joining forces with Castro\nMorgan comes into the picture and the number I in late Nineteen fifty seven and by the end of Nineteen fifty eight it's becoming clear that\nDean fifteenth rather military the Cuban military is basically going and that's how they're they're giving up a in this fight\nAnd ... what led to this it's you know Morgan another\n[noise]\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from ABC fine wine and spirit Florida family owned and operated since Nineteen thirty six ABC's sourced and certified collection features winemakers in distillers from around the world sold at ABC source in Florida celebrations began\nAt ABC F.
