know it's a huge part of my story um when I was a Fifteen Years old I was I I had gone to a a a leadership a center up in Saint Simon's Georgia and you know I had one of these experiences where I really felt like\nA the lord had a plan for my life and uh that he was going to be an important part of it and they were going to be many journeys ahead and my maturity had to develop now I'm going on my fortieth here tomorrow\nAnd he has been a sustaining part of my life I have a personal faith walk it's my inspiration for what I'm doing right now it's where I derive much of my value system but I also recognize\nAnd I think as I've developed for my college days to now\nThat faith has a place in the political swear\nBut we have to have leaders who recognized the need for people of all faiths to have a seat at the table and those from no faith tradition and I think that's what's made my voice a little bit unique and it's been hard to pigeon hole me and then I'm somebody\nWho has been very distinctive and walking his story I think in a faithful way for very long time but I'm also someone who has a great deal of respect\nAnd curiosity and relationship with people from other traditions and that's what I Want to be a part of my story then fall and\nI Want to turn to a second issue that's important which has a faith diamonds should face we believe in second chances theloop forgiveness

eight years Governor Scott has not given these uh you know ... criminals who have served their terms fully the rights to vote and to be full citizens again\nWe have probably one point seven million people mostly African American who are listening franchise they're not able to vote is this an issue that you want to do something about\nI Do and we we will and this is what I call one of the great civil rights challenges of our time one of the the real honors of the last Eighteen months and the moment so I remember I was in a an African American church in Orlando with Reverend Jesse Jackson\nAnd I was speaking he had just spoken and then I'd spoken I was speaking about this very issue and I looked at the back of the church and there was Desmond meet at the back of the church Desmond meat is in many ways the prophetic voice the inspiration initial inspiration behind this ballot amendment for and the restoration of rights\nAnd I stopped my remarks and I said Desmond made is that you are in the back stand up and he stood up and I said Reverend Jackson a that is that as our\nThat is our modern day hero on these civil rights issue this is Desmond me this is what he's done this and Reverend Jackson's stood up went to the back of the church pulled him out of the ... took him to the front of the church and I was just a powerful moment\nOf course I Want to ask you about a a moment in college where you made a statement and it's kind of come back\nNow we believe strongly obviously in all of us when we've made mistakes being able to say well that was a mistake yes and uh and and then moving forward we were kind of in a political time when a lot of people tend to not want to own things that are mistakes and and so I learned from that and here's where I'm going well how do you deal with that 'cause that's come up\nA few times about your statement and I'm ... how how would you respond\nWell first we have to own our mistakes and and I've done that and take responsibility and and share how they've made us better people the context you're referring to I was a Harvard sophomore I was Nineteen and then Twenty years I'll run for Senate by president\nA was a painful election where I lost by a hundred votes\nAnd it became a very big issue that I was a Christian or some of the same issues we're talking about Twenty years later they were talking about then it came out that I was a Christian there were a lot of people that believe I did not have the ability to represent a place as diverse as Harvard because of that very fact that the simple fact even

hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nStories most that were very positive about the the example I sat there but I had said something in frustration and hurt a about some of the a Jewish editorial writers who ... not like me for whatever reason and\nUh I had not seen that comment until I ran for governor Twenty years later I had not seen it it was actually not a part of a a major story that I had even seen that were so many stories written about it and I've even said at the time I Do not want to be the poster boy for the Christian Coalition that's knocked me\nAs I was smart enough to know that at twenty\nAnd so when this came up in the election in the primary you know I said hey that was me I take full responsibility but I Will not take responsibility for anybody believing I had an anti Semitic bone in my body then or now I don't think my life\nAre there any evidence for example but I recognize in the modern day politics we're living through anything that can be used at twisted a in a way that can be effective for another side is fair game and said we're that's part of what you sign up for to do this work\nWell even the great Billy Graham you remember had to have to go back after some tapes came out and say you know what that's not who I Am and it's not what I Believe in it it changed his life in terms of how you dealt with politicians should as a minister from that time on so very very interesting well thank you for that\nI wanted to ask you because we are show a fake also you spoken about your own faith and I know that\nYou can because he's your running mate how was also um mayor Gillum faith informs him about what he does because I understand that he also has a faith\nAnd one of the things that I I think it's so interesting about the two of you as I think and ask you to address it both as people of faith we all we we often think of and we try to do away with that idea on the show that people of faith or judgmental and and they're they're not nice to other people and they they don't care about people don't believe the way they do but\nI I Believe that both of you have shown an example of faith\nIn politics that could be different than that so what about mayor Gillum as well\nAs mayor Gail I'm definitely a has a fake story and a face walk and he talks about it you know he had a grandmother or like praying grandmother or that in the midst of a a pretty difficult are challenging upbringing where he didn't initially have a lot of opportunity\nA from a place of faith told him he could do anything he said is mine too uh any dream was possible any any challenge could be ever come in\nAnd he's carried that through his life he had the church is deeply a part of\nAnd that and he tells his story pretty powerfully but I think what we're doing\nRabbi as we are really breaking a lot of barriers on what people of faith are supposed to look like yeah public service because of the last Thirty years the religious right the moral majority were different and we're saying we don't want fake used to be as a wedge issue\nWe want this to be an inspirational force for good to care for more people are to lift up more people\nAnd we're trying to appeal to Republicans Democrats and independents to share that view\nAnd I think the model that we try to project which is you could have a strong faith but that doesn't it can drive you can motivate you can give you values but it doesn't mean that you ever need to impose on other people or be judgmental what\nI learned out of that and I agree what I learned at Harvard I wrote my thesis my senior thesis
