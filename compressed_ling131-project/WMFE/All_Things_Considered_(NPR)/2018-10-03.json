considered also Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories many for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAt our latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing the column on line that I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect any and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well [noise]\nI did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but I think often survivors are putting their parents and different category is a lot of when and\nSupport for Ninety

including this all important teenage years related health has over twenty pediatric locations that serves central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nAnd and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\nYou know it just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of co tax for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can ever make me do that with ... and we do that with breast feeding\nOf these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on a spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to call them it was published this week [laughter]\nYeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yeah please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife uh forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi while\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone\nUm so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and that they have enough for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAt is causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ... Washington Post columnist and her new novel out this week is Cold War outside thanks so much for joining us today\nThank you for having me thousands of planets have been detected around far away stars in recent years and the scientists studying those planets may have found the first moon NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nEven in our own solar system some of the most intriguing places to hunt for life our moon like sell it is and Europa around Saturn and Jupiter these\nMoon seemed to have oceans of water beneath and icy crust it's been hard enough to find planets around distant stars let alone moons still David chipping thinks he's finally found a really good evidence for one\nEvent is so strange I'm it's the first time that demands for higher level of rigor and skepticism than you would normally applies to run as a middle to touch tipping\nIs an astronomer at Columbia University he points out that our moon the one with the astronaut footprints isn't just a pretty face it keeps our planets tilt stable it affects the tides\nSo when we look for in a twin and I think one of the Muslims things you might ask you to have a mean twins because it seems to have a large influence\nWhat's more he wants to find moons because when you eat the calls home there's no reason home couldn't be a moon\nHas been a key driver for for a while just to understand the cosmic how to toss out the book full from us\nA couple of years ago he had a colleague named Alex T cheap began scrutinizing data collected by NASA's Kepler space telescope\nThey checked around three hundred planets for any weirdness that might mean a moon what popped out was a planet called Kepler sixteen twenty five be Jupiter sized world that orbits a star around eight thousand light years away\nThey followed up with the Hubble Space telescope and today in the journal science advances they say this gas giant appears to have a Neptune sized moon\nWe're still ... that we think is the leading hypothesis the researchers have requested more time on Hubble to do more observations next may if this does pan out and turned into a true discovery it would be really revolutionary\nMegan ... an astronomer at the flat aren't Institute in New York she says moons are kind of the next frontier when it comes to understanding alien solar systems they capture imagination she says if this moon can't be confirmed new telescopes mean that before too\nLong scientists should be in a better position to find real mood if they're out there [noise] Mel Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nFor Trump to gifts to all of his children but Donald you write more than any of the others you describe him bailing out Donald Trump time after time there's an instance where he bought three and a half million dollars in poker chips to rescue in Atlantic City casino\nBut there was one time the father pushed back against is on Donald Trump was beginning to suffer from dementia Donald Trump tried to change his father's well\nWhat happened that was right in Nineteen Ninety at Donald Trump's darkest financial moment he was facing being forced into bankruptcy by who's creditors\nAnd he had some lawyers right up a caught us all a change to his father's will that would give him much more control over all those assets\nShe didn't tell his father or his siblings who was doing this you just have the lawyers show up at his father's house I believe it was and the piece of paper in front of him\nHis father or somebody in the room realized right away this is not where we want to go with this and he pushed back and ultimately called Donald Trump sister who was then a federal judge and a lawyer obviously and ask her to intervene and to make sure that\nDonald's creditors couldn't come in and pillage Fred Trump's empire and Donald we wouldn't have any more control or influence over the state than any of those other siblings would\nThe White House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about the transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the Trump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today Thanks for having me are\nThe New York times story you just heard about says the troops were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax finding as usual is one thing to have a self serving valuations that are on the global side but it seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades and simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns as now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThat ... that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resource as they're not going to be ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nIt appears to me that the state department of finance as an utterly asleep at the wheel for decades [laughter] when it comes to a transaction some on the term family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations but severe us as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS finds evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well\nJim Zarroli NPR News New York [noise]\nAnd you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThere was a new mandate for corporations in California by the end of next year publicly traded companies headquartered there must have at least one woman on their board and I'll have to phase in more by the year twenty Twenty one diversity advocate has spent years pushing for this and not just in California\nMen hold about eighty percent of the board seats fasten ... five hundred companies but there are lots of reasons why other states might not follow California's lead cake ... reports from San Francisco\nThe idea that companies must now make room for
