the White House to make complete total sense out of all of this hey I used to hello let's start with the why why with Tonya even there today he\nWas a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump\nThey've been exchanging complements for a while it really picked up after World War the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial and west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat are they Saturday Night live to improve on or what I mean the liberals improve on is if you don't love\nWe don't look this is\nWhen was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis\nOr because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are and Trump's claims that west coming out of the port of them has boosted his standing in the African\nWith the African American community and now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west in brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him okay\nSo how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nThey talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with them of West interest uh Kim car Daschle in with his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues\nShe's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time ... what\nWas the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nWhat he seemed to talk about publicly was that a about the free of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago game\nGangster disciples who is now in supermax prison serving multiple life sentence this ah this was the case that is different from usually the case of that prison at Purdue reform advocates usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh\nWho have committed non violent offenses and ah\nWho maybe got really extreme sentences uh but uh we really don't know what's going to come out of this and whether this might just be more of a photo op for western shop\nNow than it is that we keep seeing here are of complete destruction but can you can you give us a more accurate scale of the damage right now [noise]\nYou know there is no counter anything but the kinds of things they're facing there's water boil notice so you can't but you can't really\nBlew your water if you don't have power um unless you have a way to set

actually identify you\nThe same way that did you get them you there's multiple cars or like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course the judge will record you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify are supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on the national institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... supposedly anonymous databases really are\nYou can be done on the can get you ... you can catch criminals with these techniques but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either to

uh we okay refusing to commute to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration of lifting DNA behind a wheel K with foreign governments are going to exploited the technique\nTo

solved\nAnd ... says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is a New York university law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to call back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your

launched from Catholic stand NASA pays Russia for these want you to the international space station and about two minutes into the flight there was an anomaly which forced an auto a board of the space capsule carrying NASA's Nick egg in Russian Alexi of chin and here's what that sounded like\n[laughter] and I find that my family was\nSo you're hearing emerge in the future failure there from mission controllers we heard\nFrom NASA managers today that the investigation into what actually caused the anomaly is underway and it's too soon to say for sure what happened\nBut just who are cleared the two on board are safe that's great [laughter] so what was it like for them during the emergency landing\nAfter the capsule separated from the rocket it began what is called a ballistic return so basically like a rifle bullet the capital begins spinning to cut through the atmosphere on its way down than deploys parachutes for safety planning\nThe during this time the astronauts felt six to seven jeeze that's twice the amount of force in the body they feel during a normal lift off but from start to finish it took them thirty four minutes to get safely on the ground\nAnd we heard today the Russian space agency is investigating the issue so the good news is they made it back safe but that means they didn't make it to the international space station what does that mean for the astronauts already on board the station\nWell Nicole that's where things get interesting a little unknown at this point so just last week three astronauts returned from the station so right now there are free on board and one Soyuz capsule docked at the station today's launch was to staff up the station as well as provide another capsule like a lifeboat\nHere's the thing that capsule docked at the station now it has a shelf life it's about two hundred days\nIn right now is the only ride home for the three on board the station including a NASA astronaut oh so how much time is left on that capsule will the capsule is good until about early January the current crew was scheduled to stay on board until about mid December today's crew was their relief\nAt a briefing today NASA managers seemed optimistic that Russia would find the issue and be able to fix it so they could step up the station before then here's ISIS manager Kenny Todd\nWe got wrong way in front of us so I don't I don't worry too much of a role model for\nManagers also stressed the crew has plenty of supplies and will be just fine in the interim\nLet's hope we don't even have to consider this question but what if the Russian space agency can't find a solution and time\nWell that would mean NASA would have to make a decision so they could either extend the mission of the folks on board or returned them home leaving the station on crude manager said today the station can run without a crew they just don't know for how long\nNow says working with private companies space acts and Boeing to ferry astronauts to the station and and the reliance on Russia could that be a solution\nWill could but those missions have been delayed into next year the first human test flights are scheduled until mid twenty ninth team we learned today that the first ... test flights of those missions schedule for early twenty Nineteen would require a crew on board the station\nSo having to do the crew to station could cause a wrinkle in the commercial crews schedule and another thing to keep in mind the cold Russia is still investigating a hole in a box or use cargo capsule that caused a leak and the station back in August so that could also complicate the investigation\nNinety point seven space reporter Brendan Byrne keeping an eye on this morning's emergency landing after lunch to the international space

there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nKnow this was going to the American ... hate first time into the second for like the ocean and what kind of training with they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as accomplishment out for quite a while as you say with space flight experience\nNick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job\nSo they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this large they might working together for a couple of years we're ring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional\nRight on top of their game you would never know the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to al Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely back to her\nWhen would be the next ... you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine the psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to space today you know kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start\nThinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take all kinds of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of\nInformation people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem a manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline in three months from now then no big deal but if it's gonna take a year or two years\nThen we need other plants Boeing is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship stay sex is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... that stocks to the space station it's sort of like a life both\nAre in their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want if they ... to come home and they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated on a ship that after\nA little wild things start to go wrong and there'll be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander of the international space station

way the Turkish officials did\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference is almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the
