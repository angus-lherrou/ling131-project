stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears are you sure Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console Lorraine cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nThat is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what I Am more than she does and I have not\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people\nAnd calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to\nThat well you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any vote or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thinks Asia thank you\nFor [noise]\nYou're

department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThis fall as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border posts as a national security threat here's air force general ... who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance you'd be these capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so they're already something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nIt just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty switches transportation aerial surveillance are kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role to get a new law enforcement activity no interacting\nWith migrants we're told but this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first of all we do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopters there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so these soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nForces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well that that's where the visuals say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or their own leaders support role again and the policy come and told US law dates for the post civil war era in the eighties seventies and it was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed [noise]\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms as far as which others would it be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past into getting into support role\nIn this case so you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who were doing everything you'd get from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel books even lawyers in public or the stuff\nIn the journal or showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said\nOf border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments at the Pentagon thank you Tom You're welcome\nIn their quest to win back the house of representatives Democrats are focused on twenty five house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he's betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike NPR's Kelsey Snell reports\nCarlos Curbelo isn't shy about confrontation hearing this summer bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't have to deal with Trump to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics that petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nAnd that took her belly we spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change in trade but he also largely voted tobacco president agenda when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by speaks team points and he's running on a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't remember ever apologizing for anything I've said whatever I've said is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him win in twenty sixteen but Democrats like Marie Elena Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nHim into print so he talks the talk that he's a moderate but when you see his voting record is not the case and unfortunately most voters didn't do that and they just hear him and they say wow you know he sounds like\nFifty or his opponent Democrat sending the car so Powell is trying to change that you know they need information we need to provide information an ad that make voting easy it was heartfelt Powell is an energetic far educator mom and an immigrant from Ecuador\nShe's running on protecting immigrants health care and the environment all things that occur Bello says he also wants to protect their locked in a battle to convince voters who's telling the truth\nI should be I had basic things like that it's a straight democratic district but it's not it's complicated convincing\nVoters who's right is a unique challenge in a diverse district that stretches from the suburbs of Miami south farm fields and onto the tourist how the key west\nAnd that Seventy percent of the population is Hispanic roughly half of Cuban descent curb below the son of Cuban exile gets a warm welcome from a lot of voters here he sleeps seamlessly between Spanish and English when he's talking to constituents and he pairs boundary pushing politics with personal attention\nTake a recent event worked for balance in Senator Marco Rubio we're pushing back on Trump's new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada\nAll hardly mentioning Trump finance we want to have strong trade relationships with our allies bought we believe that this should be fair they focused\nOn a new bills housing area fruit and vegetable growers who are largely left out of a new trade agreement [noise]\nPeople like Republican tomato grower Karen Carpenter state that personal connection is important\nI mean it's hard not to like the guy like that I mean they become solicitor has to\nDo something about the problem that affects state and his area\nAnd a lot you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challenges have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their problems in the car so Powell also worry that the people who needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism may not show up at fault if we get our people to come out and vote I\nIt's going to be a close race for me my focus my campaign's focus is making sure they know who I Am I message but also getting them out to the voting type\nThe last few days of the campaign will come down to who's message voters beliefs and it might help ... case that Trump himself is coming to Florida this week but not to campaign for her bell that maybe just what he means Kelsey Snell NPR News Miami [noise]\n\nThings for having me we're going to take the

November includes for different questions\nIt would mandate as State Department of Veterans Affairs for Florida State anti terrorism office it would also change the calendar of state legislative sessions and last it would make fundamental changes to the wake county's are run\nNinety points evidence Matthew petty and Danny Rivero from our sister station W ELL Iran tell us it's that last question that has county leaders in Miami Dade Broward and evolution up in arms\nThere's a long history behind why Miami Dade County doesn't have an elected sheriff\nBut here's an abridged version in Nineteen sixty six the sheriff was indicted after a grand jury found the office was essentially running a criminal organization the office was protecting legal gambling operations taking hush money from Brussels and it was even extorting illegal abortion providers for protection\nYeah it was bad budget decided to get rid of this year and instead has been appointed chief of police\nAnd since then we have what's considered to be one of the finest police departments in the nation\nMiami Dade mayor Carlos Gimenez is not happy with amendments in which would force every county in the state to have Bob elected officials\nBesides the sheriff that's a property appraiser tax collector supervisor of elections clerk of courts\nDade is the only county in Florida that doesn't have an elected sheriff if amendment and possibly the county would also have to relate to supervise their relations and attacks\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of maybe point seven W.

M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nNo politician myself I don't think we need any more politicians thank you very much\nThere would be more elected leaders of this amendment passes and one of them would be running the Miami Dade police department the biggest in the state\nYou either have faith in the people's ability to make decisions or you do not\nMichael Atkinson as the sheriff of ... county in the Florida Panhandle he's the former president of the Florida sheriff's association they've been pushing amendment to and\nThat's really what this pulse down to ... levels protecting your individual right to make decisions and to to balance this power years ago in Tallahassee Atkinson wasn't appointed chief of police like in Miami Dade I Will tell you having done both you would think that being a sheriff is more political I'll tell you it's list political\nScience that's ridiculous um because when they're all politicians\nMiami Dade mayor he meant as says elected sheriffs are some of the most powerful politicians and their counties\n... county sheriff much it would doesn't feel so powerful and that's why he's the forcing amendments in\nI mean it's so ridiculous years I Can't even ... even though I have reward money in my budget I came post reward money at a homicide without going through county council\n... wood was elected but he still has to go through the county commission to get approved for how he spends his budget\nThat's written into the county charter the document that outlines how local governments are run\nThere are twenty other charters in a state of Florida not one of them is to reach the elected officials ... those who approved\nHis budget the last two years\nThe county council unanimous we gave him everything you wanted\nAnd Kelly is loosely county council chair he says ... residents voted for the charter and it's worked well for nearly fifty years\nThere are lots of reasons Kelly doesn't like this amendment especially that it would limit count the other side of the sheriff and other elected officials dispute side of the shares budget would have to be settled in Tallahassee these elections get partisan and setting up these new officers of tax collector property uprising and sheriff would cost the county money\nThe sheriff feels that it gives him more control but I Want to remind him that the governor also has to ask her to people on his budget and so does the president of the United states\nTo put it his way share ... woods says this dynamic isn't fair other county sheriff's get to decide how they spend their budget why not Lucia\nI don't see flag with county ... or ... or Palm Beach sliding into the Atlantic ocean\nI don't know why we're having this conversation\nBroward County is top administrator Bertha Henry is live at the voters from across the state will decide how her local government is structured instead there'd be a tax collector who Henry's office would no longer directly oversee\nWe believe that we have um a government that works it's been in place since Nineteen Seventy five and we'd like to retain that\nBoth sides say they won't accountability but they disagree about what that means is accountability giving people a direct site on more county officers and letting them vote them out of their unhappy\nOr does accountability mean giving the county government day to day oversight to those offices\nAll that it was just one of the four questions in amendments in on Matthew petty reporting from Philly ... county\nAnd I'm Denny Rivero reporting from Miami in

are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly can you down how did she\nBecome and hateful and he did and how long has that been going on and what role ... plane\nDid the current sort of political anger and comfort playing on so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer finals are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nKind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears are you sure Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey they're allowed so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage and the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on this rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign event where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any India's was more than she does and I have none\nAnd says that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people\nAnd calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump seemed to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponent could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House
