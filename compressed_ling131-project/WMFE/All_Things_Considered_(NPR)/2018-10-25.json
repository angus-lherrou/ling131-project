M.

Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black face [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian American pie or anything of Mickey Rooney character and breakfast at Tiffany's um but it does mocking depiction of the people of color that these Halloween controversy set against\nThat and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured were often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles who are not wearing black because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise]\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white paint over to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of broader context we always start in a store vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because there was a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it through when he's controversy going to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video have to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery and so maybe they know conversation will be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on A People's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently\nProminent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen\nThank you so much my Louisiana over [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise]\nAnd on our feet from that dream and when they decided to leave that country because they don't have anything now face to face a negative for high they they've perfected leave and I think we have in our next to survive\nMaria Rubio is a communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking\nWith us from ... well President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and should have known you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's\nYour argument this is actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nation\nStates goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave yes\nSo if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternatives is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now\nWants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention program some Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speech to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now\nTrans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nNot just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nYou know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end\nIt is the responsibility of the Central American governments\nTo protect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations so much my pleasure

the brain may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nDoesn't get much respect scientists often dismisses does that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum\nSo they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico do some boxes they found some surprising connections about twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion of eighty percent of that\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from our land out how to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six out patient ... more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nForward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting in the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks as the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear than I could've ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist had been missing for a long time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nWe have an explanation father bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking started rather editing are your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of serve but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs at on low income mission means that served by them is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it's moving out to our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task what\nWe now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution that when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder or have a link to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these
