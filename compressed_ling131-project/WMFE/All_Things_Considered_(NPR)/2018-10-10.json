vehicles meet the same safety standards as other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely or we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says Leno's should have their own standards because they're neither ... nor buses\nRegular started to Jim in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a logic came into effect in California it\nRequires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill cruising find has the c._e._o. of dreading lacks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified the action can be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that amount is sometimes I'm the value of those Lindsey\nButtons on day also says he personally would support more safety regulations\nThere should be a nationwide deletion say make sure that these vehicles are up to date in the streets are wanting\nSome stretch when those are safer than others he says companies can do whole test where a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something before the impact you can see how they were not when we installed washer bleach underneath the vehicle and on the jury or the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and find tastes as\nSome of the public not care about the ... they seem to care about the price\nRose Mary Shay hand as the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the onus shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's it's really grossly unfair people are always care about safety I think most people assume that if they're in the business that that their minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating Leno's safety\nIn twenty Fifteen there was a deadly Leno crash on Long Island\nAfterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issued a call for federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them living of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to see a lack of movement out of D.C having states will lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are still working out exactly what happened in New York last weekend when the two thousand one Ford stretch limousine crashed and kill twenty people but they already know that Leno had failed inspection and the driver wasn't properly licensed can you ask NPR and you\n\n\nAnd then I was reading some schools are had reopened the rest of the craven county schools that\nHad been shot since Hurricane Florence we're set to reopen next week did that\nUm some of them did some of them still are not\nAre not opening um we we actually had five different shelters were twelve hundred citizens and now that sounds about a hundred at our Web newborn rec center a we have two large rec centers and they were one of them uh had two

luck and stay safe thanks so much [noise]\nStocks plunged on Wall street today us stocks all their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one point which is a three percent declined to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also feel what parts of the market fun is\n... well a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of a this market but ah all of the um all sectors really were down um [noise]\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk game since mid summer but the tech sector has been the hardest hit and ... and as I said I just wanted to foundations with mark and in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five ... which also has a lot of tax\nLost three and a third percent so it was a tough day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate and the Federal Reserve has had said they will continue to raise rates were actually suggested I'll stop raising two it's been my ... and the benchmark rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable high and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve\nHas said it will continue to raise rates gradually and just as you suggested will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go there are some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a lot of employment at a fifth year low so there's concern in the markets wages will began to rise more rapidly and create more insight flashing pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... student ... good for the stock market what happened\nWell the economy is strong in the U.S and most common dangerous saying today sellers who is not the end of a double marketing stocks so a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe is cool to bed and so I've emerging markets\nOr the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are these concerns about global trade war\nA disrupting the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China\nSo what we saw today is this could this be the beginning ... long downward trend\nWell most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling\nToward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading\nDriven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling given the strength to the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit is it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nBut there are are are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months to a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession\nAll right That's NPR's
