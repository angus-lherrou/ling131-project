mentality\nMeets weekly focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states is\n[noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask us to just send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare [noise]\nDemocrat happy Affordable Care act Republicans found one of their best\nTalking points they used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing and we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThere are Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has failed harsher a tale of Obamacare failed by a single voter away today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine fifty one\nNow Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care fall election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it that has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this\nWith NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the health care as their\nBest issue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with that how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about cost but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle then Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for affordable accessible health care not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now this is Patrick Morsi's laws to take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily wiggling away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years and it's worth\nPausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads come down to you voted to do this and Republicans\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando how to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care\nIncluding nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skim for your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people are but could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace\nWhich despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate bill that didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that dealt with those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative selling so voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace still that bill would have done away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans\nRunning for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks in an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nAnd that's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year I'm a democratic ad yes like Scott had more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks the things here to tell them building Democrats field is here that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nIs the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia\nJosh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying oh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act", "show_name": "no_show",
