and I'll never forget I was on the airplane going down\nI was handed a photograph of the Miami Circle and I think God what is that big rectangular thing looks like a four by a piece of plywood right on the perpendicular by sector of the interior of the circle which is about twenty eight feet in diameter\nAnd three state officials looked at one another and they said\nIt's a step to tank I watch uh so I think that at that point the research question should have been out of that septic tank\nTo hear that go with the apartments built in the Nineteen forties did it and go with one of the earlier

funny and someone sent him a postcard that they've got on ... and said he said there's this show\nAnything from the site well I wasn't sure so I started doing my research on E. bay and buying postcards that showed that area and sure enough one of them may show a round structure that\nApparently close to our on top of rare that a septic tank is so uh I think what needs to be done still to

something else\nThat's clearly not a very a popular idea especially people in Miami who worked so hard to get the federal government and and other agencies I guess ultimately it might have been the county to buy the land and preserve the site\n... points out that rather we're not the Miami Circle is authentic it is located on top of the significant to cast a site that was home to a thriving

library of Florida history and cocoa Ben Florida has always played a pivotal role in our exploration of space from the earliest days of the space race\nYeah that's right and in particular Florida's east central region Cape Canaveral the small\nLand mass the jets out into the Atlantic was really the perfect spot to uh begin launching at least test flights\nAnd then when we started with a man flights in the early Nineteen sixties it was a perfect choice and of course what is now known as the Kennedy Space center in the NASA facilities out at Cape Canaveral really in their infancy in the early Nineteen sixties but this area and the state in particular played a very pivotal role in the beginnings of a what we now call the space race\nWe were competing against the Soviet Union to not only put a human being in space but eventually to get to the moon which of course was accomplished at the end of that decade\nIn Nineteen sixty nine but there was a series of missions that actually started here in Florida or were launched into space and and many of the recovery efforts were done in the Atlantic not far from a off the coast of Florida some in the Pacific\nBut all of these engineers there were a lot of people involved in the process outside of just the astronauts\nThere were a number of mechanisms that were in place to help facilitate not only the space launch is but also the the infrastructure and facilitate ah these programs\nNow in the early days of the space race in and even still today much of the space program is conducted with a certain amount of secrecy right\nOh that's absolutely right now as I said before we were right in the middle of the space race so any information had to be incredibly secret because we didn't want that information to be leaked to the Soviet Union and potentially be used against us and to beat us essentially in a space race but there were other programs those as well there were tied to\nThe space industry that where I Would argue equally as secretive and one in particular actually has to do with the board Historical Society and in kind of a strange way but it goes all the way back\nTo the beginnings of the space race here in the beginnings of a manned spaceflight specifically in Nineteen sixty two and I'm Talking about the friendship seven mission this was the third of the mercury missions to to put a human being in space\nOr John Glenn was the astronaut who piloted the mission he was the first American to orbit the earth you already are three times the mission lasted almost five hours Steve Walsh from Cape Canaveral was recovered safely from the Atlantic\nBut that's not what's interesting about this story earlier before the the flight was a launch the U.S post office decided to issue a commemorative
