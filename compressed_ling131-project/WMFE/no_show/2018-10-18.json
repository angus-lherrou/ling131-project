warehouse where we're at the studio and this was wide open space until the production company moved and then we have this set up\nA which was three wall entered stores and all the things like that and the all the furniture and props and make it look like a real in Jersey and\nI mean the floor was a kilometer new with our light stands with the lights and grip equipment and the various things like that cable snake all the poor light distribution to the lights and then of course the camera and the camera do and they had to keep doing things clear so they can move around those as needed for the shot\nSo it was a quarter in a way but it entirely different than it is very typical movies that\nCabin has fond memories of working on the film Johnny Tiger\nWas Robert Taylor's last feature you did a to made for TV movies were MGM before he passed away and and this see look for as a crowning changing his career\nHe says I'm fifty years old why am I making love to twenty two year old niece pictures and says this is my change from her romantic lead to a character lead and they really look forward to it in fact\nHe was willing to do anything to promote the movie he was so thrilled about the change very nice gentleman enjoyed working with Robert very much\nIn addition to owning the building that formerly housed shamrock studios bruso Donahue has another tied to the film industry in Florida appearing in the Nineteen eighty nine Ron Howard film Parenthood Josh\nPresident of the college part little league or they needed extra hours for the little league change than a coach mellor from the city of Orlando called me and and then ... you're gonna get a phone call from the ... and so we ended up getting thirty six a voice from the college part little lake\nAnd are actually they I was not going to be in the film but I was going to be there to make sure everybody was safe and Robert Stewart city commissioner today was supposed to be the base on fire for us and he was on fire for the league\nAnd Robert called me one day before the shooting says I Can't be there and so I called a casting director I sound short somebody\nAnd she said well why don't you do it All right I guess so\nSo I just did my little job out there I was with them anyway and then the last day Ron Howard came up and said hey sign this week we want you to make a declared as NFL I'm about to\nUh the Steve Martin sign catching the winning ball and one of the game okay so uh and lo and behold it made it to the final catch a fish will actor and it was a great find find time and Nineteen eighty nine there was a very exciting around Orlando for all the different places that were being used in people you know being in the film [noise]\nIn Nineteen eighty seven both Disney and universal announced that they would be building film production studios in central Florida in addition to movie based theme parks the name Hollywood East was being used to describe what Orlando would become bill Simpson says that didn't happen\nSounded it turned out that way because Florida truly was in a very enviable position to be Hollywood East\nAnd it's still to me a little disconcerting that are played out the way it did a New York and Florida\nDuring the Nineteen seventies Nineteen eighties were\nThey were the second busiest locations for film shot outside of California I mean they were neck and neck they were truly rivals you know for the honor of second place and that was significant\nThe smart money would have been on Florida because of the year round weather being so favorable for film shoots a because of a an infrastructure that supported us such endeavor of because of an inexpensive labor force\nAnd then of course you had a the opening of Disney MGM Studios and there was a Nineteen eighty nine and then universal studios Florida I Believe that was in Nineteen Ninety\nDays were primarily theme parks but they also in film studios attached to them and so there were many TVs and and movies that were produced in those studios and of course Florida itself is a prime tourist destination so yeah the theme parks in the studio component to those theme parks and\nThey were set I mean it was really primed for that kind of endeavor to succeed here\nBut something interesting happened and that was Florida as tax incentives for filmmaking began to dry up\nAnd so by the early to thousands most of those have gone away\nThere was also a high profile a failure of the tax incentivized company in Florida that was set up in Palm Beach and twenty twelve and that was digital domain and so there was on a bad feeling in the state legislature after that because all the money that had been lost homeland upfront investment was just gone\nAnd so after about twenty twelve you didn't see much of a tax incentives for filmmakers from Florida\nTo really what's happening right now is that a lot of this is a lot of filmmaking activity has shifted over to Georgia and particularly Atlanta area and there's a lot of creative filmmaking types in Florida liver actually either commuting back and forth\nTo Georgia are actually moving there 'cause that's where the where the business of\nAn example of Florida film production moving to Georgia can be seen with the film the unknowns it tells the uniquely Florida story of the highway meant artist the African American landscape painters from Fort Pierce but

Thompson as well as a few other Flagler related affiliates\nAcquired the three other local newspapers and printers in and around a St Johns county including St Augustine\nThey consolidated these operations into what would become the record company and the record company the main\nGoal at least of their business was to produce a local paper which became the sand are seeing record but they also produce a lot of these pamphlets they had a division devoted to the production of promotional literature and but also a lot of internal material related to the for the east coast railway and hotel operations\nNow you have here many different very colorful pamphlets brochures and other promotional materials that were printed by Flagler is the record company yeah\nThat's right and what we're looking at today is kind of a collection of a lot of different pamphlets that were produced by the record company they were all printed in house in St Augustine\nAnd again it's important to think about that kind of operation I mean a printing press on its own a commercial printing press it's not like today we didn't have computers and things like that everything was laid out by hand the commercial machinery required to produce these types of materials including newspapers but also different various size promotional literature", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "18"}
