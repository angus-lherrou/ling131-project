H. Y. Y. Joe thanks for joining us great to be here you\nMean you could start with you to know this is the lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nFor the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles and the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on the national Security Council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the districts do talk a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it it was a little bit more detail about who lives in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the west into the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs\nAnd then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so it's a swing district to it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter this I mean given ever talked to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year that the kind of see that goes\nIn jail is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country but I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really what had changed the current health care structure you can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around her using it in their favor\nAs the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those work ... and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions are aligned that we might not have heard\nSay four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that NPR diminish ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you to Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you got
