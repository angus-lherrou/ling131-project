mid nineteenth century all the way up to the late twentieth century by the Sanborn fire insurance map company\nA and the company was created in Eighteen sixty seven by Daniel Alfred Sanborn who's originally from Massachusetts he was a young civil survey or who was contracted by a insurance for him to create a map for a particular area and Massachusetts\nWell Mr Sanborn realize the potential for a potential make quite a bit of money in creating a a a standardized map system for large cities uh originally throughout the northeastern part of the United states uh but that expanded throughout the entire country\nAnd in fact by the early twentieth century the Sanborn fire insurance company had created\nA detailed survey maps over twelve thousand cities and towns throughout the United states including quite a few ah right here in Florida\nNow what's interesting about these maps as as the title indicates they were created for insurance companies are in their underwriters and they are\nA very detailed survey maps that are ... mentioned before are highly standardized every single map for every single city that the same format company created 'em all use it use utilize rather the same color coordination system\nOr indicated where a physical structures were a throughout a every single building in an entire town too if you look at one of these maps today you get a very accurate or idea of what a town look like say in the Eighteen Seventy or you can then compare that to what it looked like say in the Nineteen fifties\nI'm so there there are again very a detailed mess but they're also ... pleasing as well again because of that uniformity\nAh so there's a certain amount of of artful unless that really went into these uh these surveying\nOr maps now a Sanborn like I said was started the company in the Eighteen sixties and through the late nineties in early twentieth century with the enormous growth in in the urban population of the most US cities and towns", "show_name":
