more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nFormation that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants I was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar the brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a\nPlush sponge Bob Dole kit that lived on that being back here so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call and it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer\nAnd they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title to Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it\n[laughter] yeah that hurt I won't hurt a little bit I've gotten over it but you didn't know what they were talking about you know they\nThey said the the name of chipper chip and just we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm other guys I got this audition how cool is going to be a [noise] and like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob do in the hands\nBy like looked at the dog and I looked at the poster and I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob\nI'm that is a crazy coincidence it was it was really wild\nYou go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive high pitched kind of get ugly voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right yeah that was like both\nI'm a conscious decision as an artist\nAnd also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure uh I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me\nSo I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina land out of the director at the end was like a great job on them come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\nCool for cocoa\nYes he said you were you were sitting at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and Juliet did\nYou know yeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah and I had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of this workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid and DC and so that that was something that I always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious death [laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics or jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense\nSo we're kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training is this five years you've been where he asked me if I'm sick wow\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned a great ... right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah and yeah when\nYou see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gas\nYeah I'm not saying that I can I get thank you to a you know Jonathan notes and yeah my contortion teacher amazing oh okay I was really aware of the demands going into it\nAnd I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot and you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it has made you a more optimistic person hopefully we\nTotally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privileges you know being the sponge\nEight shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's\nBeen a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yes and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like\nAnd and I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends ended up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one people tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and what sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself\nYou know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days [laughter] that feels really for\n[noise]\nUh All right are you ready for an ask me another
