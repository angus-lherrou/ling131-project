and uh everyone really loved being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and you were forced to basically fend for yourself uh-huh\nHow did you manage\nI don't know yeah I mean I'm\nYou know I had a very\nClear I'm at a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our household and so\nI was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in a actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had it I'm very clear in my mind that whatever\nHappened that I was going to continue\nGoing and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out
