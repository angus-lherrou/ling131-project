pretty clear by\nThe slimmest of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking that she was going to be supporting Kavanaugh and then just a few minutes later\nJoe Manchin the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cabinet and that brought us to very clearly locked in yes up\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nYeah and and for me it's it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust him the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing the Supreme Court of justice partisan and tribal as everything else where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an

of the week [noise]\nRuns United we\nGet these holler and these are held we will never found out why and if we buy\n\nEvery week we focused on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme laying out and races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate red ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative you've been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIs really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can yes wise I actually met her before\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump he told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at any ... in the beginning the his governor for re electing\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had her she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she said because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane\nLook he's showing me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still and you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and ... it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this is a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week off me you were there\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nThere there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott of being his hard line on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill Nelson really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race\nAbsolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr you lead in last for ... for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said as the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and was yelling at the top of the tickets they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOr a ... and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty
