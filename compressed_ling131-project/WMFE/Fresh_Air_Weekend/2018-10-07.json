the reality he's the chairman he's the c._e._o. he owns\nHe controls ... sixty percent of the voting share so if you're going to understand Facebook in any meaningful way the conversation really has to start with him and end with him and and for that I think they ultimately recognized [noise]\nHe had to be a part of this project the company has come up against a growing and really serious decline of public trust both among politicians and among the general public and\nI think they recognize that at the core of that and I think he recognizes that there is this profound question mark around what

whole range of new ways of accessing new populations people who wouldn't otherwise have been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply have to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries\nAround the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they cross the barrier that smoked which had prevented other social media sites from growing\nBut he did something even more important which was the day to stab wished\nThe sacred important really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a team
