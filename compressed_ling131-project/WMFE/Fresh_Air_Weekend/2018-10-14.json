who was Neil Armstrong's life they were married I think for thirty six years and then I'm divorced\nWhat were some things you learned from her that help you understand what she and she's portrayed by Claire fillet and when Armstrong we're going through during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal is Janet had in common was disability to put on a face and in moments of incredible upheaval\nYou know it was something in their character is sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had that ultimately you know it was very much a product of of of their time in their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and you know I really got a vivid sensitive when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when ah you know you're you're you're moving from place to place going to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot VX Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is working a dangerous job in in a way eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and and all this with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was a simple as that in a way but of course that's complicated is that\nAnd uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities instances of that we depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a instead to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tells them that he may not return\nMade him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded and Jim Hansen's book I'm beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what the conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually wasn't mean a lot of that team in the movies taken verbatim from what she writes elected and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his sons saying I might not make it that that she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yucky that\nAnd he has been in this incredible like low key way without really\nThat really showing emotion\nI mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think it's\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando

people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple of without any fear except for this sort of deep ... fear that I think the constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think is a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nI was just as music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah that yeah so it's it's a ...\nPiece called lunar Rhapsody ... and ... when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with all due respect you Neil Armstrong like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pre ... hockey and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your ... to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\n[noise] I was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a image mentioned in genetics book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nShow for it or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal is with the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from ... or shock and\nAwe and whatnot but you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a they're kneeling Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no wonder Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI think well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody

remember had writing it oh yeah and I remember him being your took um twelve years [laughter]\nYou know started it started when I was very very young at here versus I think three eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was no one string guitar in his underwear\nAnd there would always be versus consult and then I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song presume album which by the way Sony at the time didn't want to put out ...\nIsn't that amazing an amazing turn of

of his life and for to get back to question for me to have\nSat on the side of the stage you know watching my old men at five years old and all the way up to ... to my forties um the whole can of his work is just living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nYeah so for hallelujah as you're saying there's there were there were eighty four ... versus I don't think he ever recorded oh eighty four\nBut did it take twelve years and any for versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that time\nAs the popular a poem the tone is never finished but rather a band [laughter]\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think ...\nWas expected um the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as if he was very ... from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages\nAnd gave up an enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised norm is about\nTo go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patients to my family my masterpiece some signed\n[noise] you know you quote that you know some people subscribe to the to the last if he first started ... and that's often attribute it to a one of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter] yeah he he edited and take away the edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic\nIt was a constant process of filtration and refinement to certain\nSo why why don't we hear hallelujah your father's for sure\n[laughter] this is Leonard yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right you got to be friends Gretchen yet yeah refrain\nPlease refrain from playing out because I think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something you know where's the beef give some other songs a chance to get played um it was it was partly joking partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family have an ... yeah I think I think will play in any way you okay with that\nOh God you know what I'm doing a report you to the bully police [laughter] okay I heard
