biographer turned literary forgery it's based on a memoir by the Israel\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting oh no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but\nThe most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all\nCalled in to meet with the principal and the other couple the Leslie manpower rod couple have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car did you say that\nThat's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do have to say or even you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them\nResponsibly no no when he when he said to me was he called me a one language Catherine language for me to relate what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door so\nAmusing man maybe if I look more like this fake bank commercial that's what you look like\nLike your baked commercial couple none of this talk is productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you both ended up with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner me I Will throw you choose your own you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty it's just you kind of improving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that's something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people I Hope ever but\nThe first time I watched that back I kept\nSaying I didn't say that [laughter] never say that and the person was sitting with was to sit for watching you say you set all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nMelissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about an acting or comedy which came for us like acting or comedy but comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and they moved to New York and I was twenty kind of out of the blue I hadn't living in Boulder, Colorado not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and uh had a friend come and see me\nThe bar for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nDo an open Mike night tomorrow night and I said All right I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and I kinda thought\nOh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching and then they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm gonna go this direction\nSo um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there when you went into a regular comedy club you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like\nYour top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you has any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein\nAnd especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shuttered now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it so in order to actually make them be quiet\nI felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work somewhere I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I always kind of go down that road like can I get a show of hands from women who isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like [noise] so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh ever present uh not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't know what the white men I would've flashes like ... yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get for ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up\nPeople actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept\nTalking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like\nNine minutes and uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\nYou you're one of the women who has taken on like producing an and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure\nThat you can act in material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nMm\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMm\nUm\n\n\nThis is fresh air weekend and Terry Gross my guest Paul day now is probably best known for his performance in there will be blood\nA teenage evangelical preacher imagine being in your early twenties and working on that film director Paul Thomas Anderson an actor Daniel Day Lewis they know it was only twelve when he had a part in the Broadway revival of inherited when starring George sees Scott\nDino also co starred in the films Little Miss sunshine twelve years a slave and portrayed Brian Wilson in the film love and mercy now the age of thirty four he's directed his first film called wildlife\nThe screenplay which they know co wrote with his partners away 'cause then is adapted from a Richard Ford novel of the same name wild life is about a fourteen year old boy Joe who was recently moved with his parents to a small town in Montana he hasn't yet made friends\nHe's looking to his parents for a sense of home instability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose the mother played by Carey Mulligan takes her part time job to help make ends meet\nMeanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decided to join the men fighting fire which leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the in determinant period he'll be gone\nAnd that changes everything just as fires can get out of control in people's lives\nHere's a scene in which joke comes home from school to find his father breaking the news to his mother that he's leaving them to fight the wildfires sorry\nI'm late [noise] talk to your father tell them not to act like a fool of not being Bush\nI put my name on the list I waited for my chance and now the financial place for me you don't know anything about fire you'll get burned up well I've been reading about them I don't know reading about studying\nWords on me gee what's going on with your father is leaving us go fight wildfires\nWatch Jack White or you will the grocery store we'll go out with a bunch of them are getting\nOlder than me whatever [noise] what what did they pay\nA\nDollar an hour [noise] sure it will be the last one\nDon't know how it's going to go out and everybody knows what do you think about I don't know\nIf you don't know what I'm\nDoing a problem and Jerry why don't you have grown [noise]\n[noise] well they know congratulations on making this film and welcome to fresh air says that this film is adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wildlife how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with that [noise]\nUm I was a fan of Richard Ford's I just read a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called book court which is which is now closed looking for any other book of his\nOpened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence or even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not my I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nWould you read the first paragraph from the novel which we happen to have sitting on the table here\nSure [noise] in the fall of Nineteen sixty when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working my mother met a man named Moran Miller and fell in love with him\nThis was in great falls Montana the time of the gypsy pays an oil boom and my father and brought us during the spring of that you're from Lewiston, Idaho in the belief that people smoke people like him are making money in Montana or soon would be and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of the collapsed and was gone in the wind\nThank you [laughter] languages I I'm a big Richard for fan and full yes I yes I agree so tell us more about what you related to in the story of this there's the writing which is beautiful yeah but you were a death in the story so what was it about the story that was\nSo even about twenty pages into the book there's a paragraph about a um kid watching his mom teach one class and thinking that everybody around her thinks oh there's a woman was a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong at home\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or great song or whatever is it felt like it's for you in some way and map\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen\nYour home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet\nYou know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time\nSo we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan I'm really close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having\nYou know struggles and their relationship sort of what a profound and gets difficult moment that was for me so this book sort of reflected back to me how family\nIs one of the greatest slugs in our life and because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest source of struggle in our life and he was able to capture about with compassion\nIn the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy\nDo you think Joe how awkward is ...\nThe bar for Ninety point that the news comes from Orlando Health covered the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that she's darling do health dot com\nThing are related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about um accuse rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling a ground shake and not wanting things to tip so ... Joe and I have something in common and and Richard for than I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so it was something like that I'd been posed to me\nUm you know I Want to spread\n'em out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and then kind of help\nDid your parents separate well my parents have an interesting situation which is they separated they like the end of this book strangely which is on the on the film ... living together a few years ago they never got officially divorced but we do not always lived together\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and this year you're a teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nDuring the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nThere's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also incredible capital asked you comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and he become and happiness and in one scene in Oregon here he's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is the scene where baptize ing him and I should just say parent that ugly\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident and then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another\nOil accident Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nWe thought well what\nAre you\nThere was a huge\nJulian\nMiddle right\nYou don't need\n\nWhat do you want to be [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "city": "Orlando", "day": "28"}
