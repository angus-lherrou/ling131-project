[laughter]\nAnd\nListening to radio lab [noise]\nRadio prominently there'll be you and why [noise] for\nYour time now to practice some very useful phrase is I'll save them first year repeat I remembered and together let's forget\nThis is radio lab today translation\nIt's time to begin we'll have five experiments in translation trench creations lesson number one the best poem was by my mother got got a few people know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi that Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug hostile professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which has a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in him a thinks our producers and leave the because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty\nOne I was taking a French literature class on one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little pop the kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage ... ah three\nSyllables per line it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize that I still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card written by this guy ... who was a poet in the early Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote the palm for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first\nYeah okay it's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos hell so to speak securing lady of the young lady mommy none of us who doesn't look born through\nLucy's you see a piece of ... ... to be to the mall ...\nVice fee onto the taboo ... to see what you do have told my dad who to a to point about it all on bump one ... to ... ... ...\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks and you were I was really ...\nThe opposite I was I was a wish [noise]\nOkay so he reads the bone files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have a translate into the number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what\nI meant was to say well here's the thing he said he got this phone mommy none of them\nDoesn't look booms and if you just focus on the words of basically it's just this guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president who sees you please I cling on to ... to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam movie too so you don't look so pale and you lose your plump shaped ... units are like get better here's to good health\nDrifted wants to do the ... I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ... the tone the light hearted mess and and this is a key for Doug ... also known as the pumps form it's wonderfully catchy little sausage shape on the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know a a B. B. C. C. D. D.\nAnd uh the first line mom union is identical to the last lying I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems in a moment of ... the one I did I say three syllables per allow you didn't ya yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate that um you know along the way\nHe began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines at the bottom for example vast sea onto the top ... like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display\nHere instead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in bend instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their\nCan instead of coming in and out of slurping slop in that are burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my for translation please\nMy sweet dear I sent cheer all the best\nYou're forced dressed as like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you are a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while embed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health be near my sweet dear so Clay

health dot com slash kids\nWords but the words represent concept the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on her just some people\nLike just stick their fingers and jelly no bread need it\nOK okay fair enough feeling like he hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent the palm to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank in soft bill to regain health dress and fully off with me Clement who calls from\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous you\nGot the pale face in there you got the gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas dirty lines long so extra long and twenty eight was a sacrosanct number so let's just two lines so no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable Paul I'm uh twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming and to the question for him was who could get the feel but nails the foreign he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nCall on an Ethiopian journalist I Want to make sure you had a fairly distribution yeah here Carrie pointed this one guy in the second round the young guys twenties boyish face wearing a moustache I've\nOnly two

I say something um I I I Try to be serious about it and I think the fact that I'm doing that is serious and when I raised him by name in my comments today\nI carry sounds to me like he's sort of insulted by the question and and yet felt so remember\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so what this journalist you're saying is you are you just locking London or are you doing something may\nBe threatening you to be a who is withdrawing eight or with strong support and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously calls for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and that's a serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what do you accusing me of not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry the uh this uh this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards\nCan you

subject really seemed to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting to see was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he thought from schooling
