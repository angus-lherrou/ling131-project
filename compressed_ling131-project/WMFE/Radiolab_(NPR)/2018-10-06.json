Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] they're going to start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times\nWe've had on the show before and say something Hi [laughter] okay I think it's good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson and\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when I became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and the press how many people do is be killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nAs mayor rice and Harris Sam dubose on become sort of a national story and I personally was having trouble and processing that like the number one\nIs there a is trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nSo that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for himself\nAnd the police department that does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching their word Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nSo first study had Florida because of their biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records laws legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and sell Gore's then sat down and started emailing\nEvery single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves\nA year of work how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive saying that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nAnd then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know for sure that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many documents do you think you have sitting on the stuff is probably five thousand pages out a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we've\nGot an broken down by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B county book or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and you basically just has a all leaves a manila photos with tons of papers and spread across the entire ...\nAs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nA eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise] didn't involve a an armed suspect or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these are the how how we can come out of the data and build a data\nBase and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions from lessens some solutions\nDidn't all went into an online database to Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will off link to it from our website radio lab that are highly recommend hopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agencies keeps track of the stuff in any case\nIn the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you\nLike on the most basic level a are that about a third of the police shooting case it involves someone on the other side\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how his over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is what is somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get them so shocked intentionally person is in view\nOf the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to shake his weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting starts right\nThis is something that people will cover police apparently know quite well you know\nDo the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question which is a number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a data out of whack with uh the for the demographics\nNear what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida your four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nStarted tell us much right now but the breakdown between fatalities for the same demographics and as we say that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent of blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you\nGo all around we try to support if many mothers and we can because it's important that exactly like that what it is it really just like a\nWorse Yes sir it's a good point because that mother who have lost their baby needs to be able to see somebody else who looks like them in the same situation that they are as someone walking up to them and saying I Know how you feel but you really don't [noise]\nWhich made me think about to be bending I had talked about a lot which is\nIn getting to meet these women and talked to these women you get the sense that their their experiences is really unique\nSort of law it's up to lose somebody a cancer of lost friend the cancer recently attract\nThe horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his first wife children but it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person is killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge of you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see in bed numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults right Senate minutes I'm\nTo get an extra brown somebody\nVeins on them and then you know here in Florida wow\nWe said in the club that\nAnd so after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of mom bailed out in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or you know I just wanted to know them was there and has been telling everyone about them\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but as big as this must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping for you right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way 'cause their personal gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the large staged a certain point because it was talking to two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand\nOkay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like to say something\nWith that I open my windows and I just knew will go through my house she has a page concert down you know I'm just\nAnd then I then went from the gym shop over the crystal\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adult including this all important teenage years later health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that really no health dot com slash kids\nIn her cousin were in the kitchen\nCooking chicken never got a good\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nYou\nKnow even before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\n... fire\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight of houses\nWith me in each other head on the couch you know the mattress it becomes like a huge leap over in first before the secret of talking you know getting to know each other you know some are twice over his shoulder so it's like therapy for\n... let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women just really stuck with me to believe or add I'm Marlon problems to students when crystal let some of us over\nTo the site where uh her ex husband Marlene was hit by that squad cars [noise]\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grad so\nWe usually the video that we just say\nMy house probably over like right now and then the police caught attained behind him was probably right here and then the officer say they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we called the extradition of vegetables are says to the garden and vegetables\nAnd all that\nWell I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released they put down the type of stuff we came back here it's all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you play any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when a plane I mean if you get that smell like it is you get slapped mhm in\nYour country and brings you right back here mhm\nYep in the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nSometimes we're sort of your teary some of the other one that started crying [noise]\n\nAnd then you don't want me to a second yeah my find to be a lot of what about falling to me\nA couple of women handed me the phone lines\n[noise]\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nThank you for just sharing with us because I Know [noise] to\nIt was also very ... we saw that last week\nAnd I threw a clock in the morning\nWhat I remember being like to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him [noise]\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's British about Fifteen minutes at a time I visit home I have\nTo go there all the time of course\nYeah of course how could you not\nAnd then I Know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh and sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a listen if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every day and the little white man\nAnd everything like that I literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nMy dad would be I don't know if you're in the way I like going on and all of that and it's a little white guy to always sit not\nKeep taking care of the whole\nKnow what I'm [noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise]\nTo me to repeal who was the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Gardner's mother I watched as my daughter was lower than to the ground\nAnd it was around the time that a few of these women started call themselves the mother's moving [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd we read it because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nFrom just my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military there were my best officers they are level headed there well trained they know how to follow the policy\nBasically know how to not freak out during the confrontation and lasting promises lasting one of the most important thing to it says\nIs you have to get into the community and I'm not talking about the the good stuff over there for Christmas gifts or they cook Thanksgiving dinner I'm Talking day to day you have to get to know people\nWho are Essure\nAnd so to make this point to where it got up walked me down the hall to another office\n[laughter] had sent me down on the computer the sound comes out of us want to say OK showed me this video to video starts\nIn silence and his body cam video it's a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car and he's got his body cameras mounted to his eye on his glasses to the cameras going where his eyes go next to him as your side is a partner both capture white also it's night so\n[noise] cause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people he's off his meds if he was on a crack cocaine binge remember correctly where they parked slow neighborhood street and you can see down the street\nWalk away from this shirtless black I don't you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking to them cop were in the body can end this black man you got us on race pretty big knife in his hand any walking toward the cops want\nYou know crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the copper in the body chemicals out there to Asia the other officers out it was added a frame is behind him with his firearm out and the\nGuy down is approaching approaching approaching a protein now he gets within like ten feet of the cops and then\nThey go hey hey hey hey\nThe galaxy campfires 'cause he's the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\nYou're gonna get hit again or you're going to get it again\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he was over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she changed central cohort cups and then\nThere may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nOfficer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to try your best shot I say if you want to die I Want to see that you want to die [laughter] you can't die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats cake you'll\nHang hang on one of our parents want to\nLead to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the UN's huh\nAnd said this is the thing that you guys will use this video for\nWhat it does warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that whenever they are now you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner who is holding the gun have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deployment taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to rush to communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek Derek Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up to ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nI'm biking through the neighborhood as you mentioned on the front step waves of hatred what I Do I'm In the dirt doesn't\nStupid sort of a bitch you don't have close came to be that would be back with us medication wasn't doing drugs that he was as we as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again are almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners they told him he just said he has now militias will Sarah my shit would was elected the sheriff of pollution\nCounty [noise] friendly\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long his organization called ... which decreased executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition a police chief twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being some beans law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out this principle two of the biggest pleasing organizations in the world the icy pie the international association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the ice sheets\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated

thinking about this like you've got these women who have I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make you just feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too\nBut [noise] there was
