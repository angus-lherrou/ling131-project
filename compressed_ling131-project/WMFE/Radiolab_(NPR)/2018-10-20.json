we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no to things we have to say what don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout the show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must what we've done is on the radio yeah so she got kids with a you may want to make me wanna yeah anyway the story comes\nTo us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight Georgia how about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo [noise] and I was singing and swinging directly in front of the glass doors headquarters of [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nIt was a humble gathering is on a few dozen women and babies that\nRight there are you there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie mirrors\nWhat are you calling for their same\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken it themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up all of it is [noise] they want to\nFace but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise] now\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest\nWould turn out to be this morning a face off on faith ...\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered a hornet's nest in what would become a loud but do face will rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled said look the bucks a day playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches [noise] but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\n[noise]\nViolence against working the muscle what we can say and what we can't say that again by this on the subject of what we\nCan see and what we can see let me learn right kids on the\nOn the Internet\n\nThank you Mr Cameron and Mr that come back I got to\nYou use them jak just delayed prioritize or sensors debate and ...\nWhat Congress woman we don't ... the\nGlobal for doing of censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you print it off\nAnd die in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written\nAnd can you even have one rule book\nRight exactly and so I I dove into the rule book and dug up some stories that really put it to the test ... so uh let's start back a on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started\nIt all [laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a
