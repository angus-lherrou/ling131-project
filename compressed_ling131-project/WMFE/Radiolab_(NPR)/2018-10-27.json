been reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in

into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on a sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get the\nOther campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in front of the circle and then\nThe men cocked the gun and said listen or killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nSo come into the woods near Brooke compare the two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their ... he pulled out some wrote basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so\nAfter we had the foreign people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard build his voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the name is ... gave the buck and I\nUsed to have been five times\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBottom demand caught one of them David Freeman she took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying on the debt chapter then our men come\nMen that the

trail and just in a very short time they saw Daryl he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nYou know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nSo they put 'em in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him [noise]\nThey're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise]\nBut you wouldn't talk and it's at this point that the story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording [laughter] and so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm many\nBrenda lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife and solve it they use that urban but it is or money\nAnd whose parents had no idea where they were\nTwenty one year old Susan pads and another girl sixteen year old ...

murdered the two of them had been camping and using it then Don ever since at least her how she was a high school girls from Syracuse she had gone missing just a couple of days before season and everybody thought she might have just run away but\nGuerra told the lawyers that he had killed them and where you left their bodies one odd thing about arrows description of the incidents he doesn't say I killed her she says she got stabbed with my night\nShe touch with my life like it wasn't even in doing the stabbing right like this is what do you do first and foremost you have to ask yourself is it is true\nYou know your client is obviously severely mentally ill this could be a dream he had it could be a delusion\nIf you're going to go and um you know craft an argument and and present a strategy you need to know what actually happened W walk out the door he grabs Frank and he says he says let's go so they they slip outside they get in the car and we\nTake off to go look for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine\nShaft the mind is up ... about an hour south of the hospital\nA burden had around ... in in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you rub pie so high but you're scared you're concerned yes fear food if you don't\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talked to her ... her car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving a lady friends car to drive the news and the tail\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis may be as far as we walk up to this whole abandoned mine\n[noise]\nOut there last February with reporter Lauren ... and the town to provide your of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father system a road that goes to the mine is what is clear to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail grown or you're just because I'm very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking a very wooded hills fairly ... feet\nFor Ninety point at a news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nSo here we are in Sunday's suits Rico tragedy choose for is looking for the case\n[noise]\nSpent hours looking [noise]\nWe've found is when you see the air ... fair\nThey find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across it shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for this has given any such little yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nOr you could see or sneak the blue shoe simply sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd a leg\nAnd I said to myself so smooth which does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your\nMoney back up don't\nTruly algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery workout headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took you know to keep the confidence is over ... under the\nCurrent rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain gas or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be a little bit right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened waking up even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there is no if if if\nPeople are already dead than you ... the the lawyers\n... that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you have yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the ...\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client\nOnly only the agent of or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a way each year building on on the side of Tahoe just tell tell\nOf

I'm I'm Roger I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right when they knew this thing\nRelief you know it's over would\nBut then it is up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine which charges they should bring again to attorney\nPretty soon after the verdict our money and don't you learn that they could be facing criminal charges no one's really sure exactly what those might be but it could be something like tampering with evidence obstruction of justice\nOr states public health law and religion that says that a body must be given a quick in decent burial and on top of that\nOne was a marker for where\nThere was an ethical complaint filed against our money and bell gee so basically they were then facing disarming an investigation into the ethical complain that would drag on several years\nWell gee started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money tough it out but he suffered\nA no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or loosely well what else can I Do is to make your living he was just barely getting by for a little while I think you're probably oh we'll just stress and pressure to ... to ... in fact he has a heart attack\nUm while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and then the state bar the Belgian or money did was write\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAnd Lisa told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go with you here or there was a lawyer the director's job\nA ... I was a good lawyer research\nSaw through art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if\nWhat if what if you will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen in sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what the lawyer should should be\n[noise]\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I\nWrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victim\nAnd she initially didn't want to\nGo on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah\nSo I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\n... okay I'm I'm Roberta patch and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who Armani indulge you found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it's that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the content of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified that think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way can do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um that that that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health to cover

we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic\nThat's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli\nA lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months\nOf horror and and this is what if they taught law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professor law students there um when they approached the crust it's with a lot of sensitivity\nAnd they are they are struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess\nThat's that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to Munich at some of that experience yeah well it's impossible to\nReally communicate in words I made forty years later and skills I I get ... ... it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of 'em that stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about 'em using that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWell what can I say she was she did receive her degree pass too much weight I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd you know and Danny what's your boyfriend had their jets that summer and he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just before and so ... and I'm sure the other two children get\nGreat future ahead of them and it's just a horrible tragedy [laughter]\n\n[laughter] so it's horrible you know to be in the position\n[noise] I mean how do you really lose you know I was wondering uses for protecting the person that killed her\nNo justification you couldn't justify mine mine\nExpects them to where it is", "show_name": "Radiolab
