M. F. ... FM Orlando Melbourne Daytona Beach\nIt to school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it students have said it by hand guns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district um or Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nAnd the people on this team only two teachers onto it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team recently pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw the ride a bunch of drugs\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the air safe get the guy out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drought\nOkay we're going to pay for this or just one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from buying study fire during these drills so\nThe first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe you had to put your finger on the center has like a hundred\nAnd it's a little tricky my\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John principal for grade six twelve and he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun ramp bullet proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking you told me that every few seconds and one\nOf these shootings and other kitchen counter nothing nothing this way [noise]\n\nElementary away and you're sending elementary way [noise]\n\n[noise] I'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door is there and it's like this happens automatically when the focus into like that\nThat he and the two guys with him or stock ... for his keys\nAnd he's trying to find the right one guy driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything\nThey're just timing the response\nWasn't great that wasn't the attorney ... first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\nAll I\nSaid so controversy over put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about this you know I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force mhm so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do\nBut\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle down\nAnd which is different you know first time to shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to thinking through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd one exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou got to shoot at target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss\nBecause they find is\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nCan't let it be me who hurts\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a

[noise] but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\n[noise] mhm mhm mhm [noise] and\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and effort and we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others will get previous shootings it'll pass to just be the future [noise]\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nHim WB easy Chicago it's this American Life\nMhm [noise] mhm [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example whether that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than work day I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven with that we\nCats have people that are going to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\n\nTeachers that Douglas knew that code red Trump's a fire drill they even had a plan to straighten that confusion out make an announcement clarify the code red\nOn that day and assistant principal Mr Porter did that was there an announcement on\nTheir wise but a lot of people are already out of the room so they didn't hear it\nIn calling area actually heard the ... and she's not sure about it but she's going through the motions she does ... shot and as she does\nTo always come running around the corner and they're they're just they looked terrified and they're screaming at shooter shooter\nShe posed them into our classroom tells them to get in the storage closet with her students but she's still thinking drill right there must be it must be for practice even seconds later when she hears\nPop up up up up up up up up and to me I'm like okay that's not what I experienced in the first ... just because of the rapid succession that was happening at the time I was like maybe they're they're up in their game on that\nIt's unclear how many teachers thought like Ashley and Melissa did that this was not a real code red but the promise code red drill and if this cost anyone their life I spoke to the Broward County chief of staff in charge of organizing the district safety upgrades or Douglas says he said he didn't know any teachers at Douglas came out of that training\nExpecting an unannounced roads blanks that age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter the two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she glance through her last all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrify kids running like that and it's they they're not that there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not\nWhat the drill was she knew it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she still enter doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThere are following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nThe way that the gunshots\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOrlando Health network a pediatricians are committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people on\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter] [laughter]\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder you kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied closet the month of told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark\nExcept didn't faith is led by their cell phones and most I had her phone out too\nThere's a group tax between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the flight a freshman building she ... she's an attack so I said says there is a shooter there was a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my my friend's Ferris says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told her she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm liable it\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway and we got really quiet\nUm I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement and around and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what that was happening um and and the police and then the police evidence that this is a police anyone in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like dies I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly I the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were caught\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands out\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] was uh told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls that closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started it like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see is the teacher who's arm of grades she survived [noise]\nGot Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same thing they see dead\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting trails of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook\nFor what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I'm moving out to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some experts weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson research is what's effective in these drills at ... university\nAnd it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfit safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like tapering over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso code ran\nThe codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too I'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAnd all I I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to locate code red meat families active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yeah [noise] but the idea that did this all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultant I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access for like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually curse how she'd sit in a doorway grabbing of dozens of students and I wrote a break from her school for the call\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly\nHappened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes one thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had done it\nHot do if there was a low generator home from the gigantic Billy Graham ministry my truck set up in the parking lot community and then all of a sudden this young guy started wailing Cindy mean it'd be like foreign workers [laughter]\nImmediately through with arms around her [laughter] here his pictures [laughter]\nIt's okay it's not okay it's not okay\n[laughter] let it go a little addict living let it go crier hard\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nOh God I'm so sorry [laughter] we're we're ... ...\nIt's okay honey you're doing it now [noise] [noise] okay\nHis name is ... he graduated last year\nAcross the set up for three people he knew well one of them was a teacher named ms Perkins so he really loved he said she always tried to be strict with him the can never keep 'em that fought for very long\nChance three taken nice the\nHe can nice the rats [laughter] okay okay [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of brush enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to students to stop so you want to take action somehow\nAnd then had suddenly switches gears\nAnd starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know and the food is going on in this world begins does is ... because the strip or yours drug stores are still able to get sick and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background\nChecks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks I personally by however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach\nTheir primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's defended several destination lawsuits when the Philips and ran into him face to face at a gun control of that he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and then I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists noticed treaters or ...\nTrolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting can get dangerous after the Philips is on gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail to hoaxes or one of the things that Philips is foreign parents\nAbout they tell families to brace themselves oh\nUh-huh [noise] uh-huh [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home attacks us this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started\nJapanese prime called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone\nThere was screaming child [noise]\nCornel meaning in the background panic and he said there's been a shooting [laughter] which is he talking about just Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that\nThat I went why isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and took to no never heard before\nSupport for Ninety points of a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children has been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nThese people were injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook or twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted this up says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown\nSandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking almost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips is that there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away\nFrom well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings you parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson you parents lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nThe filters now had parents that they could lead onto this was the moment that launch themselves as to what's become their life's work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting you only experts are the people it's happened to\nHelp them fight each other money and Sandy has set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and cherry scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light Bloomberg or should they should [noise] you're not sure he was you were shouldn't you know let me explain something you're right I'm not too strong person on there will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand a grief number fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople you were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWas that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who got it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland on a kitten next door at I met them at their house\nTheir son's name was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team\nWas about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors and Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play law and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mentioned on the phone calls\nAnd tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he\nMoved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital that you thought patient to match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we have to find your son and ...
