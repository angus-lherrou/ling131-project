world\nIt's just I just love that and um\nSo what you're about to hear is our first attempt at a musical based on journalism\nProbably Seventy to eighty percent of what you're about to hear his verbatim quotes from interviews the rest is artistic conventional hit up front um it's based on a true story you may remember from my radio program back in may twenty eleven and a bunch of high schools in Palm Beach County Florida a group of young police officers were sent undercover to pose as students\nThere were classes in the cafeteria they had fake Facebook accounts of course I'm there'd be complaints about drugs being sold at these schools that's what they were there to deal with\nAnd what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on Broadway pretty much everybody involved in this to cast the course of the musicians the director Michael Mayer off on Broadway words and music are by wind Manuel Miranda
