about to tell me so oh yeah and land on me\nSo the story is I was a freshman in high school um at Bozeman high school in Montana\nYes I and I was in the orchestra and it was early in my freshman year and I had made friends in high school but didn't really have orchestra friends yet we were taking an orchestra trip so that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman this qualifies as a demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle chairing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common\nSo they decide to parents room together ride the bus together to be orchestra friends\nSo um when we go to Seattle and we're like it's awkward you know 'cause we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free days they send us to the Space Needle and I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle I have\nThere is that like carnival area all around it uh-huh and we're playing the little games all around there and we won the super troopers you know what those are no [laughter]\nI'm there like the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute you're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute sort of expand and\nOh what did you go through the trooper really\nI didn't quite believe him about this but she looked it up it's true Cooper troopers\nI just did a Google image third okay for troopers and I'm seeing images of the little guy is the way it is it a generic name or is it the brand name I think it's a brand name I think from what I'm seeing here imperial super troopers [laughter]\nHyannis port or general group a trooper\nYes [laughter] exactly [laughter]\nBack to the blonde hair Hannah and her new friend Lindsey go to the top of the Seattle Space Needle to try out their prizes\nSo we we got in the little elevator and ran to the top and ran to the edge and it's rooted approval troopers over the edge because there's nothing to stop you real really yeah and we were just like in heel of laughter and it was we thought it was so hilarious and um it's sort of broke the ice in our friendship\nLindsay and had to become best friends all through high school cut the senior year four years later another orchestra trip this time to Reno nevada hennan Lindsey or in their hotel rooms studying\nAnd so when ... sitting at the death in the hotel room in Reno nevada and the pooper trooper comes flying\nOut of the sky and land on the window sills\n[laughter] we're we both like\nWe couldn't we couldn't believe it we opened the window and we read the true Britain we ran into the whole to try to like find other people that are are just are like we thought she would have been playing a trick on us but no one knew what we were talking about no one even remember the thing in Seattle and so I still to this day I don't know\nWhy that happens [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nEvery once in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show coincidence stories\nThey don't really fit into our usual every week we bring you a theme format we've been sending them aside wondering what to do with them so much to people\nI don't know it felt like it was about or French [laughter] you know it would just it felt you know I I'm not someone that believe in God really but it's a little bit like an act of God or something like just sort of cosmic and larger about us [noise]\nFinally and hit us that we got enough of them we could put them on the radio as their own\nThing so we put out a call to listeners send us your coincidence stories and you did
