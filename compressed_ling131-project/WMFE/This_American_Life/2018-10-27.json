was a good way to deal with the with with what I was going through to have this base where I could just be you know one of the great Mm\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small that sixteen year old this would feel so\nNothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents would just like how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions\nWon't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I Want my for myself when you're saying though is is that the sixteen\nYear old you would be cringing at your thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah\nYou'd be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this rating

little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story kind of remarkably like stories from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music to here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIndustry that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people\nTo watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend got with the top half\n[noise] there was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\n\nGot aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise]\nI guess basically just got up on a on phones back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was held back never said he was a [noise] I think actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was made is I\nThink\nIf I bought a lot about it about it actually good out of me thinking along [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nGot talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the
