student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started after a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district ... hire the best record on the condition\nSupport

dot com slash kids\nTeam visually pollock rushed them doing this we used to so I'm just plain how this works exactly okay so the seven guns are locked in the small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw the ride a bunch of drugs\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the guy out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drought\nOkay we're going to take the decision to warn listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire during these drills [noise]\nSo the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe now you have to put your finger on the sensor is definitely\nAnd a little tricky\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John ... is the principal for gray six twelve and he's running from his office starts\nShe's got a gun he's rambling print bass he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking you told me that every few seconds and one of these shootings and other kitchen\nCounter nothing nothing this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness in the elementary wearing\n[noise]\nElementary winning the building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principal is running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the school doesn't to live down\nThe he and the two guys with him or stock ... for his keys and\nYou're trying to find the right one guy driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go to Oregon [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they\nFind the shooter right there so that's the goal the exercise they got\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just timing there were signs and it was great and\nThat was the attorney compared to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was he got here is the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seem like the best option to\nThem but I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to the school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force mhm so if a shooter gotten to do things they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department are being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn\nSo I went out and started learning\nHow to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you should have gone that's pretty scary scary to\nMe after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd when exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target pills close as you can he says in your mind you after and vision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting her\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts\nA student at my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating are worth thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed but knees\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nAnd\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and effort and we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks a pass to dispute the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter getting into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our show today we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help WB\nEasy Chicago it's this American Life\n...\n... ... ...\nLike one readings you'll never be\nPretty sure the trying to figure out the best way to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than workday I mean they knew what to do he knew what\nEven with that we\nCasualties have the people that I'm going\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question whatever producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school with an attempt to be as prepared as possible\nFor a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDoug lifted the school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers\nPolice and fire departments\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOrlando Health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the health

information including locations Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nShe believes in a good hard thank and being proactive once she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ... for\nEvery ... this is what occurred black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kids might have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that then you still stay wraps not silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she glance through her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that\nAnd it's there they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not watch the drill was\nYou know it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she still enter doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like there was shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and laugh and there were terrified people running and I just I could not in all consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol I follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter]\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move there in the closet it was hot and dark\nExcept didn't bases left by their cell phones Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group tax between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshmen building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there was a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my my friend's Ferris says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was grades in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway and we got really quiet um had had the flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in around and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here\nAnd then there was I kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nSlowly at the handle and I opened it really felt against even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nHad were in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands that\nI\nWas told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know not be able to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands impose it closed\nUm [noise] so her daughter would open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacey it's the teacher who's our most grazed she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to Stacy used at the same thing Stacey did\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway\nAnd there's very little evidence about whether school shooting trails of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare [noise] but now Melissa and actually has been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a play\nAbout for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I moved out to a closet [noise]\nBut they also had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some experts weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnston didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done it the glass like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think and how much it's\nTwo o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso ... all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all hey I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat families active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultant I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision\nAnd told her to ask her how she eats dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student remember it was a break from school for the call\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling in ...\nThe problem with that and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with a gun me being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training of Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had\nDone it and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to tell the kids in her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly\nAnd say it's not great\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one of the classroom as you did a traditional lockdown squatting behind because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nHe can nice the rats [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] okay [laughter]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of brush enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops and he wants to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad suddenly switches gears and start selling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know is is the image is going on in this world if it does is ... because the strip orange or drug stores are still able to do and now\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to never twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks person by\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach\nTheir primary goal is to support\nBut it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns\nThere's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government staged mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are vague he's now a defendant in several decimation law suits when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control about he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living in the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stepped in and broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips assign gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved and the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hope there's or one of the things that Philips informed parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh mhm [noise] mhm [noise] [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started\nJesse ... called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone\nThere was screaming [noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting [laughter] what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room fighting down a law he picked her up and took her to their couch re held her\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and I thought they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nThat when they arrive at a community center in Newtown and he says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise]\nHe said that's what made it looked like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking almost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy said it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the filled says that there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from where they were there they ran into parents and other mass shootings you parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo fill up this now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moments that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they can see the need their new experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them fight each other money in Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids photos to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal my my own brother should they should you not the same as you were shouldn't you know ... you're right I'm not the same person under if it will be but I should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nSupport for Ninety points of a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children has been caring for the children and

informal support groups even more crucial\nWas that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who got it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland on a kitten next door at I met them at their house their son's name was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team\nWas about to go to the University of Indianapolis on his twin scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of\nOreos and waited for Supreme drops Mitt said they'd just reached a point where they were

heard neck was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and other set a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital that she thought patient to match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from neck they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area\nIs that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um media was telling you

then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot and he was never a threat to the hospital\nJust like a nightmare second ...\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the
