the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and\nUh the character and the learning I think\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you have to be careful about that [noise]\nSo so sorry for the Senate and I'm not that as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students

don't know if it's tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both it was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raises Hanna says\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of leading to do all of those\nBriefs uh how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and they're very difficult cases\nI Will take

a reporter and sad\nAnd the little helpless\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope they're talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published [noise]\nThat was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article [noise]\nBend was at work\nFearing his co workers made over here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise] it was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nOn a sock incorrectly essentially I Believe it would have to\nConvince everyone to choose life imprisonment when in\nFact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would have taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required blend

months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was that\nThe state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents who the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry present a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent it's deeds based on this testimony with only five days to spare\nPaul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news with a stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this
