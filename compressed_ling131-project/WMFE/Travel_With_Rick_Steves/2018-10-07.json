website is living abroad in Japan dot com [noise] you grow up as a child of a missionary parents and I don't I was always curious about this it seems like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace hop religions come and go do you have any everything about that well you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she do has to do with\nSacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival it might be Buddhist it might be she do it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just adding up the numbers have said eighty percent of the people identify Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and in fact he didn't understand plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred but you're right Kay because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I I guess you'd say for missionary such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nI saw it as a missionary you'd have to do\nBest from northern God's before me or or this sort of right yes it is\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kinda like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embraced on but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they would take that they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be\nThe only religion repeat what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what is Buddhism and what is hinders them and what is in slalom Christianity and Judaism\nSupport for Ninety point haven't neither comes from

beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings to God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images inching do like statues are idols or anything\nAnd it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the member who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore and now he is a symbol of the state and then the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claimed one religion over another so these are just stories and missed that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters and cultural ideals it's sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits that there are many holidays that celebrate something a sheep do and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or rice planting festivals that are related to ... though so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by I'm just confused and holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas when you're in and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the subway was filled with people with cakes and have you been getting drunk\nAnd then on New Year's and you know like a whole time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging is gone when hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of since that you may have some needed to do that temple bell very slowly hundred and eight times and then as soon as he didn't I just passed on New Year's morning\nPeople flock to the ... trying to pray for health and success\nAnd happy new year and by ...\nOr even something to put in your car for traffic safety and so on at the ... so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she do for the new year [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you can make in your book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan and routine when we're thinking about living in Japan once the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on and in the domestic world these days or just in general\nYeah so I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment in a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes and they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore so\nThere are many changing yes so the younger generation has has pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to on on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of news service or go overseas\nNumber's eight seven seven three three three seven four to five and Scott is calling us from lake mountain Georgia you Scott thanks

if you experience in Tokyo\nOr in what was your experience like why are you doing for your work\nI was working as a teacher for the University of Maryland\n[laughter] um and I taught at a military base and it was clearly Japan uh and I lived probably about Fifteen ... from the base and spent most of my time in the local economy and then I was teaching part time down in Tokyo and my I was teaching English to a group of farmers\nSo I Would get on the train two nights a week and it's a little rickety train local tries down to Tokyo I'm a teacher group of about a pharmacist for several years and I developed a a really intimate relationship for people down there\nAnd it really opened a lot of doors to have that close friendship for them and they were the ones that taught me all the Japanese basically I ever learned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTV viewers in the U.S have long enjoyed many British produced and dramas mysteries and comedies and more on the way\nThey've taken this doing
