Central Africa sent out from Britain he arrives in ... in Eighteen sixty seven and he isn't machinery and it's his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity\nBut he sees a central to listen to create least receive so he actually spends\nA lot of the time trying to understand local culture is translating Swahili ... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili\nHe is a translation of channels and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational tax to the school children in Kenya and Tanzania for almost a century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their face and in order to do that people had to be literate and missionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of missionary culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a you're a missionary uh you believe that won gold has created to old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting to in an overseas shakes day was held up as this this great genius\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI mean that's\nAny

and focusing especially on a cyber music he's fault Kevin at a team\nFrom key XP radio in Seattle head to recuse to broadcast live from Iceland Airwaves music festival\nPool has traveled to each corner of the island nation and has made many local friends you stopping studio now to share his passion for one of the hottest traveled destination to anyway these days and it's music scene Kevin thanks for joining us and thanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a radio crude to broadcast live\nWhy would you choose Iceland and why be gone back for so many years in her oh well\nOne reason is they have an incredible music scene here it's amazing a little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding and discovering great music no matter where it's being created\nWe had been going to music festivals in the United states like south by southwest in Austin, Texas and see I'm Jay in New York City but uh the first trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point that a decay XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find a great music to share with our listeners worldwide really you you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power of music and bring people together\nAnd helped create a more tolerant and understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music can get to understand each other through various different types of music and uh you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's\nFar away and there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use as your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine that can be art it can be music capture today and a music certainly it's almost a cliche but it's an international language you can send in a pub in Ireland or or I suppose in a small concert hall in in Reykjavik\nAnd feel like you're celebrating the same thing with local people absolutely\nAnd I and I think that's part of what drives K XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark sometimes I've been in in traditional music sessions in Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a match it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really\nYeah transformation ours is such a great word to describe a when you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience for summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called secret rows and they uh had an album called\nI'll get to ... that\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat must move that album I was like I Want to go to the land this music from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music favored Greek yes I Want to go to the fjord and look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that\nDown the music is sometimes so unfair and you want to be transmitted if you want\nTo go to the to the place from where it blossomed yes music and sometimes it inside\nTravel okay so you're organizing this now in the sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yes so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand and five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter] oh you didn't want to go back because he thought you'd be ruining it ruining it yeah I\nYou know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about it yeah it was I go back with a TV crew and who didn't come on we're magic amateur last year was incredible do it again yeah and sometimes it does and that so I did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of I turned on my radio show I ended up hooking\nUp with their trade commissioner and general counsel if you're in North America leaner good Johnson and that to\nA series of events ended up culminating in I was actually going to Iceland broadcasting live and I had to do a scouting locations trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now and every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back and broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people\nBut it is this music that comes out of Iceland or is this a celebration of many cultures that go to be together and nice like\nIt's a bit of both now where the music test we broadcast from its called ice on the airwaves and it's a showcase for Icelandic and Nordic\nBans new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international band so it was a gathering of people from all over

Venus I mean I've had magic experiences\nIn pubs are in in wonderful beer gardens and so on but what is the venue like does that contribute to it in Iceland or is it just I'm a concert hall\nSo Iceland Airwaves is a a multiple shows and events happening each night over four nights\nIn various different venues in sometimes not even than you are because any space that could be a cool place to host a ban becomes one but they've got things like ah the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility that is where\nAll I've been there that's a matter of pride for ... it really is the concert hall stunning right every Scandinavian capital seems to really prioritized for a suitably creative and rooted in in local values kind of a wonderful concert hall\nYeah I think all the stone is Isabelle ... Blackstone definitely rooted in their in their country\nIceland brags it's one of the most literate nations I think they got more books published per capita than anywhere on earth and has a vibrant music scene is as you're tuned into\nWith all sorts of of creative John rows and lots of creative people have you thought about what makes Iceland punch above its weight or that sort of brings a because it's a tiny island and it's in darkness most of the year [laughter] what what is it about it that has so much creativity\nManned metric that is a great question and music journalist ... been trying to break the code on that one right like why does is a small country have such an incredible music scene and why is it so creative and\nAnd I think it's a whole bunch of different factors in fact I had the the president of ice on the on my show or all of her grandson and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Orlando", "day": "21"}
