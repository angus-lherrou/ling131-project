back in late to create what he's done he's set it as a melodrama and he talks about um the ... films so he's referencing a particular genre and so it's quite high and but\nIt's it's about a deep underlying um prejudice and racism and and the ... and um it's up to the to the subjects that we haven't really explored on a stray and television necessarily before\nIt is interesting that we can look at these hard issues we've got the same challenges mounted states and\nIt sort of disarmed us to go back to the fifties and look at it and how how it was dealt with in that time and then there for the haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute or two about the whole idea of the adjustment for a society where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected in and at the same time expect more\nIn the same time I had that sense when I saw you even when you were sailing from Britain back to Australia after the war in the place to go home and the symptoms you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nWell that's what I had always been very family based women in the kitchen men out to work it really had begun that way I feel very very long time and as I say most of the men left so the women had to fill those roles they were pushed out of the kitchen and into the workforce the thing about Sarah she\nComes way they'll say Europe and surviving a Robin ... was she was incarcerated for are the three is she's in us by trade and had continued to her ... banned us in London and he's a woman who\nWho really doesn't need to be the center of attention and yet her actions keep putting her in the spotlight because she's selfless but she\nShe matches for the greater good and so I really enjoyed playing that to an ruffling all the fed is of course which are in the hats these amazing costumes in the Nineteen fifties\nAnd there's a lot of fun to be had out of it too it sounds very

certainly it talks to a lot of his tribe in 'em and internationally well it'd be like down to not be because it is it's a full absorption in another place and it's like a different world\nUm it's like traveling when I travel to Japan I this is like being on another planet I Love it so much because it's so different and so completely off the and that's what they should really is\nAnd it's just beautifully written and delicious loomed and and wonderful acting I Do think that a lot of us it's a hit in Australia in part because Australians are just just don't you come up and fifties or does it the challenge them to see where they are today and then and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what so unique about this show is that three generations sit down to watch it together and that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire then sitting around the radio than sitting around the television\nHas been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together because everyone can watch it and everyone can relate to it there's there's three generations of women and men playing out their lives said there's something to recognized for everyone\nWhat a delight for the older generation to sit down with their grandchildren and because this can verbalize or or or help them visualize this reality and it also artfully deals with a lot of the dark side of a sort of a sweeps superficial world that really need to be dealt with thoughtfully\nAbsolutely I'm citing this travel with Rick Steves we're talking with mark to
