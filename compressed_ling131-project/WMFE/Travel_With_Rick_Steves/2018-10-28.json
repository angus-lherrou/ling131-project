what a hundred years ago or so and then there was a civil war about how Ireland's gonna be managed by its own people\nExactly who aside are you on do you want a completely free Ireland or when you take this interim step of twenty six counties and kill you can get more\nSo than Nineteen sixteen rising yes the deal that was like the American revolution and ... just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that's your your Irish patriotism we're pride\nAnd even better than that right because some of the men and women who are actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote these songs and I'd like to sing one female if that's okay sure this is a song that was written by ... appears Patrick Henry peers is one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful song you took an old melody and you wrote new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the people grace O'Malley who was the pirate queen of violent born and Fifteen thirty she was the chief didn't offer clan and she fought hard against the dominion by Elizabeth the first she thinks she is coming over the waves and she is going to liberate you from the

done\nSo now at this point there's already been the the Asperger\nIra yes spreading out um gathers tend Irish people in America for every Irish person in Ireland yes ten which is actually a a global call for the Irish people to recognize that absolutely is is the new morning\nYes because money was being raised in America\nBy ... to bring back to support their efforts in Ireland and also a lot of musicians there Michael Coleman brilliant ... change the way Irish people play the fiddle his label was called republic records and they were raising money from the music to send back to Ireland [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Kathy Ryan she's been in the vanguard of Irish music now for more than twenty five years [noise] performer and ensembles like church the lady and she's also a solo performer\nKathy with names the Irish female vocalist of decades to time by by Byron dot com [noise]\nThat was born in Detroit now she goes Ireland's county loves her home [noise]\nInformation about caffeine albums and her performance scratch on her website and that's Cathy Ryan dot\nNow when we think about Ireland it's also a proud culture of course it's kind of struggle with London to be independent\nAnd I understand that the first the printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for Ireland to\nIt's a valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most except as it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett\nWhen Ireland was starving during the great hunger Thomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist you didn't believe in aggression he was a Protestant as well\nSome people listening might think oh it's between Catholics and Protestants knows the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted Ireland to be its own nation but he wrote songs and he believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of the country was through its ballot tree and I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are extant they still exist were still singing them\nThey keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or this this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about us it's not the culture of celebrity that sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the ...\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or tune it was there before us and it will be there after us so we're just playing our part and continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear or street musicians and your music in the pubs you actually\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's got all the makings of the tabloid headlines or an action movie to send up one of America's richest families travels to an exotic locale\nDisappears mysterious circumstances and is rumored to have been eaten by\nWas it true or did he grow\nAs the official reports clean [noise]\nJournalist Carl Hoffman was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael C Rockefeller\nThe Twenty one year old son of New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never seen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one hospital\nRetraced Rockefeller's German combed through our times and interviewed I witnesses to come to his own conclusion which he writes about [noise] seven charges a tale of cannibals colonialism and Michael Rockefeller's tragic quest [noise] good to have you back on the show thanks so much\nSo did I said that rocket tell her story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean Michael graduated he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and\nWent off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then a few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and he determined to go to ask Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick ... sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then I went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip pie banished\nSo Michael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one and you're studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer are looking for this indigenous art ... bring home to his primitive art museum or did he become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nWell I think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was a young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around art you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball [noise]\nAnd um you know some of the greatest started of the world she was enamored of ... and fascinated by ... culture and ... ... I mean you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were you know twenty three twenty four foot high a polls kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he you know got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island down between Thailand Indonesia as most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find a artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics and that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the entire villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top then with a Dutch miner or thirty four year old ... just named Renee washing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one asthma was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but there were also a constant warfare with each other and\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which do art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was integral part of their culture and part of that pet hunting you know was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very welcome sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into a society where one of the great\nIronies of the story is that you know this was a man from who represents you know the most powerful family in the most powerful country in the world in and asked mad at the crucial moment she was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power\nIn the head hunting and you know when the ads Mad Men who killed them did so they were taking back their tower\nWas sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and dodge efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and [noise] and they consume them and there's no more\nArticulate display of power than that\nDid they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just eating a white guy that represented colonial\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Ninety point seven W.
