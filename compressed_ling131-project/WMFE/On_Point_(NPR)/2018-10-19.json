M. S. it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising called the fire with Dr and this is how we do it now have you been happy family\nDon't your support for uninterrupted programming but donating a dollar a day W. M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nSo I'm going to pursue that is pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what a day just to say that it can influence patient\nChoices [noise] so if they if they advertising is that effective I I just want to get to why the ... the farm industry is is resisting the idea of having some price transfer transparency in those ads isn't it one of the best ways to inform\nPatients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost\nShirt so I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do is raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patience for the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today you know leads to increased awareness doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important I think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy efforts\nWhich is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principles\nThat it's not just a list price that doesn't have added context it also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient as well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they are um basically situation stressful situations\nUm if you're diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer hepatitis are HIV ...\nWe don't want people to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiated in fact there are some discounts that are written into the law Medicaid has a required to kind of mandatory discount that has to be given\nUm how would that be reflected in the TV ad would that lead to medicate mission to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah there is a the VA has this counts there's discounts negotiated between\nPrivate insurance companies pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers and there's you know other discount programs there's three forty be discount program so\nThere's no doubt [laughter] there's no doubt that the complexity of the system is better asked uh but I just I've just got a comment here from a listener Facebook a Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what will work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree well\nI I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see\nI think that overall and moves the health literacy conversation and the right direction or you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago\nUm that the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression or you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize\nThe variety of reasons and maybe they weren't brought up um and so while you may not like a specific advertisement um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines are there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for thing for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nIt well Dr Michael you bought standby here for just a second because I Want to bring in a couple of other voices\nInto this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist in senior fellow at the health foundation project hope she was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush also an adviser to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential\nCampaign Gail Wilensky welcome to implant nice to be here with you it's great to have you and also with us joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNon profit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having me to get a Lewinsky you have an extended experience as the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America\nOr I just wanted to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in pharmaceutical advertising will lead to or could lead to reduced or reduce costs overall that's the goal would have happened\nProbably not a I think having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing lead paint will make their decisions about drugs based on what it will cost them\nNow with the drug cost is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation where people think oh that's a really expensive dropped it mostly new and special and and very powerful maybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence\nThe behavior according to what something costs the\nRelevant information is between the physician and the patient at the time when a drug is being considered and then the relevant question for patients is what will it cost me if I take this drug or another drug that's really what's relevant to patients\nRight and and because of the way the American health care system a is right there are so many different answers to that question of what it could cost me and then I mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's\nNot a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there are some pretty general guidelines so if you are on Medicare and have a what is called a um a supplementary policy they'll the general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician and that\nIt's important information because there is a lot of variability but it doesn't really help people\nTo have information about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never going to you know well he may just information that that can be helpful for David\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from a guy called celebrating over Seventy five years or providing auto insurance for drivers across America\nMore information on auto insurance available and Tyco dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nAnd Charles River apparel making the new Englander rain jackets since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare folks for whatever that they have in store the new fall collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking today about a Trump Administration proposal to require drug companies to disclose to lift prices for their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising and I'm joined today by Dr Michael you borrowed he's vice president of medical affairs at pharma\nThat's the trade and lobbying group of the American pharmaceutical industry he's also an emergency room physician David mitchell joined us he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and ... is with us as well she's an economist is senior fellow at the ... foundation\nProject hope and she's also a former director of Medicare and Medicaid she served in that position or in the administration of President George W. Bush\nOr no deal if you want to ask you want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous segment\nAnd that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who rely on Medicare and against want an offer some some context show on the differences that might make David had mentioned\nShe Mira a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation Abby pharmaceuticals and in twenty Fifteen fourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks are paying the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug cost Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars in Switzerland\nThe only difference there being is that we've got governments negotiate on the other half of patients and those other countries to why aren't we doing that here\nWhen you need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is government negotiating prices a governance don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare I helped set through the Congress that's actually who does it\nSet prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community in the hospitals is to take a relief and here's what we're paying or you can participate in Medicare or not\nOr as you choose\nUm there is true in the federal government could set prices\nFor pharmaceuticals that is what happens in many other countries\nThere's a lot has been concern that because of the very long\nPipeline between the time a drug is\nFirst thought about and by the time it gets to market a estimated to be about ten years\nThat that very long pipeline makes it quite different than other tribes or if you have government I set the price a of a solution is too low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to physicians and the concern has been\nThat if the federal government I said some of the prices too low you would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area\nFor six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there was under the age\nI end up here and yes you a quick question about that so it is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research well patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost we definitely\nDo subsidize research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect because as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Ninety point seven W.

thousand five\nHe gave an interview to sixty minutes I spoke with reporter at Bradley and Bradley had asked Armstrong in one point of this interview about the confidence that Armstrong portrayed when he gave a big thumbs up to assigned to the media shortly before um the Saturn five and the Apollo eleven mission took off\nYeah but it's a little bit of a sham I've a mess you know the reality is a lot of times you get up in La Crosse if something goes wrong somewhere to go back out actually [noise] we asked you to lift off is really a big [laughter]\nNeil Armstrong ... thousand five a game hands and you eat and you write in your book in the movie explores again who Neil Armstrong was as a man his character demeanor and\nThere's a lot in the book where you write about why Armstrong was picked to be the first man to step on them and and not ... and and if I got to have to ask if I had this writes Chris craft to is the chief of flight operations in Houston said\nAh that meal was Neal calm quiet and absolute confidence we all knew he was the Lindbergh type he had no ego meeting why\nWill they knew that that the the person who are not just commanded the Apollo and mission but more importantly in the sense of who was going to become this global icon the one who stepped out and represented demanded to use the first step onto another heavenly body\nThat this was going to be a big deal to him they imagined that correctly\nAnd uh there was a private meeting between Chris craft and Dick's late in the head of the astronaut corps and George Low who is a one of the big officials and the manned space program and Bob guild rose who is the director down in Houston it was a very private conversation in fact it's this is you don't find this in any records only an oral history coming from Kraft\nUm and and that was that they were having a discussion they they knew that this was going to be a big deal and uh you know to the public what they said was that\nThe person going I first they asked Ron going off first would be based on really the interior lay out of the limb to weigh the hatch opened the way the two astronauts were position inside the lunar module and\nThat always was what NASA told the public and even told the astronauts as to the reason why they had ... and you'll go out first because the way the hatch opened it would be difficult for buses to beat the first one out\nBut in truth this you know this meeting was really what the decision was based on and that was\nA they knew that Neal was the type of personality that they felt would actually um you know could could serve as this icon I mean there was a lot of public public relations in a sense too what are you know NASA was doing with the Apollo program and they wanted the right kind of representative for\nFor this and so it was not just a statement about Armstrong a but it was also kind of a comment on bus I mean they knew Buzz Aldrin quite well when they knew he was a very very professional astronaut\nBut they also knew that personality wise you know bus was quite a bit different than the he was very extroverted he was\nYou know ... he was there was an element of narcissism and buzz honestly\nUh and they are some commanders in fact when I interviewed Frank Borman who's manner of Apollo eight\nWarming made it very clear to me that he had told 'em leaks lightened that he would not accept buzz on his crew and it wasn't because he wasn't again on a profession astronaut but they were just elements of buses personality which were a little difficult\nAnd meal could handle them a man and buzz and he worked together quite well but they just felt that if you know between these two men there was no question in their mind that Armstrong ... would be the perfect next ... a loon bird and buzz would be much more problematic\nWow interesting but let's get back in time considerably if we could I mean tell us about a Neil Armstrong's younger years they see here that did he first start flying at the age of six\nAnd he took his first airplane ride laid right okay I was sick I ain't got his pilot's license on the sixteenth birthday before he even\nTried to drive an automobile yet little interest in automobiles which is kind of surprising for a boy back in that era but he has become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he bought he had his mommy saved every penny for from everything you did\nTo buy 'em model airplanes and he built in in flight magazines of various kinds and uh\nAnd so it was really the passion for airplanes and flying you know in later after he becomes first ma'am and becomes this iconic figure\nUm some biographers um you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was\nYou know looked at the stars and big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that is true I mean you get interested in that until much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened was his career\nYou know ... as a pilot going to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu in Korea then becoming a test pilot he really what led him to space was really not any you know Germany passion on his part as a as a boy but really just sort of the\nThe wave of technology in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night that he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying or or or didn't fall but he was just hovering in his ...\nHe he did have that story and what was I think really a interesting about it was he was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who really you know um I mean there was a spiritual side to him but he wasn't sort of person who\nWho would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was or what he became and so he had this recurring dream and so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because he you know I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much fat you know\nUh so he was a very practical minded guy and and even as a boy was type of those type of proto engineer the way you looked at things\nSongs perhaps ... you know since we've heard so many times sounds like it's no I don't know trite but I think for him to in the moment to come up with that phrase means most up one giant leap he's thinking beyond himself sinking for all mankind just as the plaque on them literally in the\nWinter is also become and these were all mankind him and Neal could think outside and I think beyond his own self interests me and I think that says a lot for\nTalking to James Hansen he is author of the biography first man the life of Neil Armstrong it's the basis for the new movie first man Jim Hansen is also a former NASA historian and we want to hear\nFrom you Nineteen
