years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that Arlen do health dot com slash kids\nOf edge but learning that doing so will also have some consequences\nTo limit more than ... to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide ... of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this include planting trees bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage changed lawns management as well as some normal approaches that sort of very early stages of development\nHowever carbon dioxide removal on a large scale could have implications for food security for ecosystems on for ... diversity\nThat's Jim ski scientist and lead author of the PCC report Chris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as as you talked about there\nBut it's this it's when he said that um remove all on a large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about what\nHe's talking about is this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that emissions have to be cut at a extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry\nThe polls carbon monoxide out of the air and this doesn't exist now so people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies and in climate models and one of the ways in which they imagined it a involves planting huge essentially plantations\nOf trees are crops in using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they were burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plant and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area\nOf land to do this and land has other uses like growing food uh so what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze you know that sounds like a a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I think that taking the risk that we can admit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out of the air\nIs akin to you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this is a norm is gamble with the future of our whole planet\nAnd and I think you know where they're turning over a\nLarge portion of our arable land to grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer has enormous implications for biodiversity inability to defeat the planet and so if we cut our emissions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios that do this and the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carp and remove all you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon remove all that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires\nThe most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon if any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying well with some of that tree planting globally or be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\nThat would generally be restoring abandon lay on marginal land on how we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away with out really compromising most of our arable land\nIt's okay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting scenario aggressive emissions cutting scenarios that you're talking about are they going into that they're just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an ... an issue with that that affects us also let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question [noise] sorry my question is\nWhen the people that are profiting from structure and then my our men like oil or whatnot when will they be held accountable like the conversation very scary but I never hear any let's take the money out of [noise]\nAnd so I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nTaxes or something to find program or the thing the the actions taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes I'm just I'm just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking in that there's something that people make billions on oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean first of all thank you for your call in because many do you have a response from her first\nWell I don't know I I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change\nIs the consequence of industrial civilization is the consequence of all of us are deciding you adopt the technologies that we created um that make our lives better a driving you know cheating your home cooling your home\nAnd many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy is mostly burn fossil fuels to the way that we live and the scale at which we are\nUsing energy is really what's at stake here um so yeah there's companies that sell energy a ... at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently or so\nIt drew shouldn't they'll pick up on that thought because I mean I think ... percent exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're staying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible well the\nThere is an indictment and in some sense of people's choices and people consuming too much red meat and\nYou know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also an indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies an automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry\nAnd this was a measure that would nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd trends

are now and how much of a change civilization ... level change humanity's going to have to undergo an order to get a hold on a climate effects or carbon defect on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he is lead author of the eye PCC report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its government that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fought the evidence the costs if there's up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what he said about global warming\nMom is talking about was the global warming and do that is a lot of it's a hoax hawks I mean it's a money making industry okay it's out\nThat's December two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump\nOr of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's report [noise] uh I mean where two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think\nAbout what the the president's attitude was about global warming\nWell unfortunately while he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both parties supported environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIt's more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're toting things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm coldest is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fuels just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really there's this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace\n... Chris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a from above a response to the PCs report a yes\nWe have statements from the state department and also I'm from ... acting administrator Andrew wheeler\nUm in our story actually I'm an ... wheeler you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world the below a dangerous level of climate change and ah he didn't identify specific level but he pointed out um that what BP is doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies 'em and these technologies will be exported to other\nCountries are still there wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard for the world coal association a they're saying that because this report clearly targets coal and says we're gonna have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely in what they're\nSupport for Ninety points in the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nBeing taken on the report um [noise] yeah I'm seeing here that the state department official um as you reporting that said that quote governments do not formally indoors specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one percent during the same time so so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there well\nAnd it's it's not incorrect us men have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world's to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius\nAll right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\n[noise] high magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I I guess more like a question flash comment on I think making and significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best hope of of actually making change so high and it's like a ... campaign like this band\nThat are you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with that unfortunately it's not enough to make a dent on and on the problems that we had in the environment um but\nIt's you know it's even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't send me from one day is that enough to make a change yeah\nWell ... thank you I'm I'm I I didn't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to drew ... now a individual level efforts a professor she knows breeze asking could they make a difference\nThey can and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not act for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems is just so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking at what we looked at was people in primarily in the west\nWho eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines just going back to what's best for them might so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge sacrifice we're asking people to do what they should do anyway for their own body\nAnd that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land that deforestation the land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport bus biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport it's also good for your health you know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars unless there is charging infrastructure and currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax\nOn electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I ... that there are ways that we can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners\nOnly if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of products so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available let's go to\nKevin who's calling from ...

rock climbing walls and he did it with no ropes that effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy Chin and Alex ...\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climbed you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single movie yeah um I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about with the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I moved my body but then you know from my new for pitch\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nSo many times that I kinda just remembered most of the uh you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay [laughter] but so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental harm or what is\nThat why I actually um I actually don't call them ... on a ... in the film Tommy says that a few times and he's actually\nSort of quoting something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut um but actually a big part of the process for me to be able to ... freestyle all cap was to sort of get past that I think because I feel like the idea of mental armor as to to sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like is it something that's too scary you sort of get psyched up and like\nShield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like there wasn't really a sustainable way to climb all kept like it is just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that\nThat at some point you know it's sort of come to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall to wall and I am and I am capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus in work that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's kind of I mean that's that's basically the the film about two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I'm into took a long time to feel comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I've been dreaming about and thinking about it in climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I could talk to you for the whole hour about the technical have preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ... but ...\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free solace many of them have died and then that is shown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climber Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the deaths of the world's best free solar climbers\nI think everybody who is made for so long and a big part of their life\nJohn back or with a pioneer Web so called three solo climbing evaluated down this past week at the age of fifty you\nWere starting to sort of on the death of us climate showing Larry\nShow was killed in Utah\nWas found a couple of days ago Harris nursing was climbing and do some of the valley his body was found Saturday morning\nFirst the climate as usual alone without roe\nMost people that are pushing the limits they have the mentality of screw it whatever happens happens [noise]\nTown they're from the documentary free so low I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing was no ropes that has really that really drew you in\nA yeah well you're a good a good question um I mean basically you know I mean to not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes free so and can mean scrambling a beautiful ridge in the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for real plus climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster rate of crime\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing in the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an anti social youngster so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the the the feeling their freedom to speed or the efficiency I mean there there's are enjoying climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing and stone a small fraction of of my normal climbing or you know it's a crime all styles you know all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various various types of climbing on free zone has always sort of represented this\nThis extra little side\n[laughter] but but you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean\nYou know uh yeah I'd actually understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of climbing to me as well you know it's only a small part of what I Do okay you know it's always been sort of the most significant and a lot of ways\nTo talk to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no wrote I mean is it is it as a zone that you just cannot enter or experience in any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into that that feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling a flow whatever you want to call it\nBut but um you know feeling like you're you're close to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here here's why ask okay because I mean a a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know and on in in some beautiful places in the west the United states and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every claim that I did that I got a little better and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my likes low level climbing\nEvery every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering minded ...\nFeeling of constant improvements yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about free zone is seeking a slightly bigger challenges things that are slightly harder than what you've done before so you feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit of butter or what you do\nBut of course with the soul you know the cost of the mistake of absolute so you know you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but never to blend\nWell I mean we were all facing in another way and I mean we're all gonna die um I'm trying my best not to die climbing you know are very much want to move to old age and have a family and all that but um no I mean I I don't\nYou're listening to Ninety point seven news that Nicole dark and crushed in in your forecasts and

... and that feed is documented in a new movie free so low which has directed by Elizabeth Chivers Sally and\nJimmy Chin a I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor dean Joseph there who did that MRI skin of your brain started talking about some of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis they're wondering now that you know that about\nUm you know that the shape in response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see\nA you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\n... not particularly um ... I mean in general as a strong sense of I mean and I am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside I mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but\nUm I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first scare yeah and um and the take away to me was basically just the you know practice that over time you can do some of the names and that's that's very much been my experience\nThat um that you can learn over time start you out there with my ... I heard that she was at one of the premieres for for free so I Would have been good to see her rather than the other one in ... hours or more extra but\nOkay well we can put we can definitely get you back in touch you I I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this uh you're living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen us and uh\nAnd they just did it was like oh well your brain's defectors obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it or I mean I've always heard it as as you know ... with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know it's I suppose it's a little bit open ended\nYeah but one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to a call he wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to guess who's calling from Deerfield New Hampshire Gareth you're on the air\nI write books um you know it's one thing to watch are preparing to go through this rig or on the wall where your every move but\nThere's also the aspect of family and loved ones are just wondering how you prepare them out of your medical record 'em before going to want to ... feet wiped out to a photo walked ones writing like that ever come into your mind while you're in this multi thousand for them\nYeah I mean does and that's probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girl from US Army and how we sort of navigate it out because in order words ... it'd be easier if you're if you're single or relatively attached um but you know Saudis\nOr sort of argued that uh that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level I just needed to to balance it properly I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationship\nWell I mean is scarce with asking though in the middle of a big time I mean well let's talk about your el ...

being sent back to adult had including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nTaking anything I was just sort of physically executing moves interest performing but then on the easier dream um I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners\nI mean I remember specifically on on my free soda cap I spent you know maybe five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and you know feeling really grateful for the people who were sort of helped me on my on my journey than and\nYeah I mean certainly I was thinking about is on as soon as I talked out about my girlfriend um [laughter] you know when I'm finished yeah\nWell I mean ... as you write in a free so does the movie does explore um your relationship with sunny McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking\nYou how are you factor her into your decisions about free solar climbing\nI Want to like I Want to have in mind LSU compression you have any more than like minds on knew what we want to do over here and it's entertaining people die\nFeel like I Want to eat in half way\nAnd when you sound like you can't mean Internet cleaning and then\nRussia than going to be a time when the ... campaign can actually change when you actually make decisions differently\nIf I had some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan then obviously I'd have to give up so I\nMean can you do you see that as an obligation now\n[noise]\nBut I appreciate your your concerns I you know I respect that but but and I and there was a few obligation now\nIs that true allergy still not feel obligated to maximize your life span\nYeah it's kinda hard for me to listen to some of those there's no like oh I mean I have struggled through the whole film there there's so many sections in the whole cringe that's that's pretty that's that was on top or you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that the the big part of what I was getting out there is that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else um I you know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so\nYou know it from is something about others not I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared yeah but\nBut also I mean that that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently will cap for maybe the seven proceeding years\nAnd so I felt like the ratio was was was different you know I mean we've been in a great relationship for three years and I've you know finish this big crime and so you know moving forward them I'm sure the the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially potential you know so I'm sure you're potentially\nSo well I'm I'm sure it would be different than yeah I'm sure it would be different or I don't know which way you know\nLet's go to another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nYeah how ... how you're doing a ... all currently Alex you have the uh the mutants climber brain so congratulations\n[noise] I'm a I'm a ... I've I did to various things from the early seventies and climbing my greatest accomplishment was a devil's tower Wyoming\nUm which you know but the easiest thing on it is the hardest thing I can do [laughter] um so you know you you are a Superman and totally insane\nWhen I was there a there was this this kid who is free sewing it and you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and and it's actually easier and a lot of ways because it's so much faster and and you don't have to stop importing protection which is really hard and really dangerous I really have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Orlando", "day": "10"}
