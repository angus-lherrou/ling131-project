Arnold Palmer hospital for children have been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nOh you you heard your mouse and described his research and also ah you know meeting the first patient that he had he had met one on one who had undergone immunotherapy for her cancer a really moving story but I'm sure if you can sort of described from the point of view of as a fellow researchers so sort of how\nRevolutionary is it that that we're thinking or focusing so much on using the immune system rather than external chemicals for treating cancer\nWell you know there is nothing more exciting I'm tired of biologists researches in our field and to see something come understanding from human biology finally revealed that we can really use it to help patients and that's an incredibly moving story that you know fortunately we're hearing lots of these stories and\nYou know that it was it's a couple of decades now in the early nineties that um there was a first clue that the immune system could do this um\nThere was some work done by Steven Rosenberg at the national Cancer Institute where he found that giving um natural drugs called cytokines that could really jazz up the immune system\nCould really read eliminate tumors in patients with melanoma and Reno cancers and\nAnd you know it was it was just a glimmer of that this might be possible and then it took decades of really careful work in the laboratory and understanding the biology\nTo really make this something that can help patients and so it's just wonderful to see the Nobel Prize awarded in this field and even better to see this brand new tool that we have to fight cancer\nNow or are we are talking about treatments and fighting cancer here is anyone thinking that immunotherapy might lead down to the root of a cure\n[noise] so we do see some curious from him you know therapy what is cure mean you know to to clinicians cure means you have someone who has a tumor\nAnd your ... somehow something we can do is able to eliminate that tumor and they didn't doesn't come back in their body um that's what we mean by cure and some of these initial immunotherapy is perhaps the patient that Dr Alison just described\nShe lived her entire lifetime with now this tumor never recurring that sweat that secure so clinicians are very cautious and using that cure word\nBut what really matters to patients is that they live a long long life and never have the burden of cancer in their life so that's what we're seeing and we're seeing that with him you know therapy\nOkay a gym Alison let me let me turn back to you here I mean what do you what do you think about what Dr ... has said is are we talking about potential cures\nFor a long time it's been sort of or you know in Brooklyn and appropriate to use words treasure in a surge Hertzberg bird or group started to burden early for\nMelanoma patients receive it'd be remember just as a single server or single round of treatments with foreign directions for over twenty percent of them are a lot at least two years after a single tree so [noise]\nUm she was wearing a group after returned people to\nQuit looking over their shoulder everyday religion I'm Wondering if are German for them or down and move on them and that's what makes me so happy about the sure about Sherman's experience because she was told bird positions don't cover the children after off our shoes or none of them are um are more troops are normal life\nYeah oh Monica Britain usually uh I mean how many I mean no therapies are ... are out there right now well\nWe have um Fifteen cancer indication Fifteen indication so Fifteen specific cancer conditions that are now proof have drugs approved by the U.S FDA\nFor treatment using them you know therapies um but what's another fascinating thing about our field is there are literally\nThousands at last count about two thousand different new immunotherapy drug agents approaches that are currently undergoing clinical testing so the field has just been blown wide open by\nA by the proof of principle that untangle ing this biology can have a true transformative effect on patient flash and I just jump in here the landslide [laughter] two thousand currently and development or in clinical trial\nDifferent agents from hitting different ... different components of the immune system um are all undergoing clinical testing across and\nWhen's the last time cancer research have seen that kind of explosion in potential therapies\nWell I don't think ever I mean this is really this is really a completely new era and you know we really have to acknowledge that why are we here we're here because there's been a tremendous investment\nYou know on the part of our government on the part of of of uh industry in understanding tumor biology in a very deep level and that understanding is leading to so many different possibilities for for treatment of care\nI Wonder if I ...\nI Would I Want to just inject a little bit of skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong because I remember awhile ago maybe a generation ago\nThere was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman researching angiogenesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of any and all cancers in the body very exciting line of research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement ...\nMagnet you couldn't have possibly picked a better example um you know we didn't plan on this but um you know one of the things that I'm sure Dr Alison can well time in here too is that that\nWork that Dr Folkman did look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Alison group has developed with a with came out of his work\nAnd the combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that it with activating the taking the breaks off the T cell is producing even better responses in some tumors so out of that nothing goes wasted so\nMuch that's correct in the run brings a ...\n... or is this coming from an ... or\n... just America or but it can be combined risk for not only other males or abuse but was conventional therapies looked him up there in Missouri learn how to address this therapy is Richard and I for any rituals tumor cells can be used prime an immune response or a stronger so many

... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology\nAnd a little earlier in the show Dr ... nearly told us that we've never seen an explosion in the terms of the number of possible treatments or therapies for cancer as we are seeing right now some two thousand\nDifferent treatments in the pipeline the research clinical trial pipeline and it's a very exciting moment in cancer research but Dr ... just before the break we were also talking about how how individualized these therapies can be so are we talking about you know slightly different therapies tailored for from person to person\nOh perhaps um you know\nI there is a whole\nUm emphasis right now on understanding the individual biology of every patient and being able to target that specifically\nUm that not only helps us develop treatments that work better it helps us develop treatments that have fewer side effects you know many examples of this and it's a general direction I Believe we're heading and all of oncology I see but you\nKnow just yeah those are just to add a burden earlier was talking about the adage institutions recognize we know now that many of those are generated by a ... that are

therapies\nA means to the gym let me just start with you I mean I'm seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars as it costs for some of these therapies that is that right\n[noise] yes yes that's correct and it's a it's it's a\nIt's too it's too hot it really is I mean I can understand I'm Sorry because and then develop my I'm there for example that changed all the rules to standard uh importance to choose correctly for evaluating drugs that target a dresser sales were useful anymore\nSo there are a lot of field trials because he used the wrong importance and separate searchers are developmental costs were amazing regard as well probably the most expensive ever I'm not sure but still that's no that's no reason to keep those purses for an hour because we certainly don't reflect the cost of a

than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAlso we've heard frequently over the many years in a gym just pointed to it that the development costs are these drugs are very high because sometimes that we're talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean the both of you were in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because the costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots it when it comes to availability to access to to health care in the United states\nWell that went in there now make nice you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and you know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs\nIt's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus\nWhat we can do as doctors and as researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients in the best most efficient way\nBecause then it's it's not so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more is when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and who's not and really as as clinicians researchers that's where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to ... who's

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd you happen to agree with Max Boot about you're concerned about where the GOP is headed what do you think we ought to do to address those concerns but if you're a Republican who thinks the party is exactly where it needs to be right now representing your interest in doing so with a full throated passion call us as well what's your thought for ... were at one eight hundred\nForty three to five five to eight hundred for two three talk uh now I'm actually in the in the last segment you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly what do you mean by that\nAll the people who who basically flat or his ego including people like Lindsey Graham who once called him a coup can now a talks about how Donald Trump as a superb\nGulf or I mean I I I have to ... chapter and verse in my ... of of of the ... of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if he were the second coming who think that he's the savior of humanity I mean it's unbelievable this as a\nPresident or you know who was only has the support of about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed itself into a Donald Trump cult I mean so many people have trumped the Kool Aid including people but I once had respect for it's it's really been a gut wrenching it in in soul crushing experience for me to see what's going on\nWell uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly\nBut for many of the others um they did heap praise upon a President Trump now the whole sort of a person by person moment took about eleven minutes and we're not going to play all of that obviously we've got significantly cut it down but here's some of the the flattery\nThat members of the cabinet where heaping upon the president in June two thousand Seventeen\nThings for the\nOne credit lotteries to leave for our health and Human Services at this time under your leadership I Can't thank you enough for the religious show\nI Want to thank you\nHigher sat around him as president everything for the last ... years [laughter] right on our traveling around the country for the last year an even greater on her to be here serving in your habit\nSo you heard their vice president Mike Pence then secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price transportation secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\nA no Macs do you know many of these people can you explain a their their unquote seemingly unquestioning unquestioning feel the to the president\nIt's it's really a cult in what I think that they feel it's necessary because they understand\nThat that Donald Trump as a egomaniac who's also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's his cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on but you know that that tape that you played some is to my mind\nIs one of the most revolting on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this is not what should be happening\nIn the White House the people's houses and our constitutional republic where we do not elect Donald Trump as king he supposed to be the president charged with enforcing the laws and yet he is being treated\nBy those around him as a few of the leader of a religious cult was profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this ... is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity and this party is around the president of the United states\nWell forgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think that politicians have a higher duty to the country and to the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans that I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham an on and on and on\nWho have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in\n... in public when I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president and why don't they do that because they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the\nThe Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against him he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people but worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better to lose reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their way very very dismaying to see\n... but let me see I'm trying to figure out the right way to ask it but it but the argument be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making the book that those very principles do or what got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your vote for support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and um there are many people today\nWho ... who cast their vote for President Trump\nBecause they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of a of international elitism gone by that that would that that was money and effort that should have been spent right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nA a a principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War two thousand three ... those same people surrounding themselves or or ... surrounding the president right now so was it not inevitable in a way that we are right here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including\nThe mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that discredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy and I I ride in the Balkans in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and soul searching white about my own responsibility for getting here I was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with\nWas speaking with Max Boot this hour his new book is the corrosion of conservatism

they've got a lot to say so let's turn to Steven calling from Norfolk, Virginia a Virginia excuse me Stephen you're on the air\n[noise] Hi Megan ... thanks for taking my call so I'm a I'm a moderate Democrat probably closer to independent and my concern is that I recognize that there is value in bowl conservatism of protecting individual rights while\nAt the same time trying to come together society grow society and my biggest concern is that you see the fringes that are just pushing further further right and left she both protect the greedy and protect the lazy or respectively so you\nKnow it seems like gosh I'm getting holding these two directions and uh you know here's Donald Trump or you know polling point pulling towards the greedy and\nHis minions and it just it is incredibly frustrating for people like me in the middle that uh you know can't find a way so just wondering if you could comment on that\nSteven thanks for your call ... go ahead\nWhy feels Stevens ... [laughter] I mean I feel exactly the same way I I'm politically homeless I I Can't be part of this Trump provide Republican Party but I don't feel comfortable being part of the Bernie Sanders\nElizabeth Warren party either and so on you know I'm I'm stranded in the middle I think you know look I think Democrats have an opportunity here because I think there are a lot of disaffected voters who could not be part of what Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I I'm In that category\nIf Democrats I think go to the center there can be a historic realignment of American politics of the kind that you saw in the Nineteen thirties I Would make the Democrats the majority party for fifty years to come I think the way they do that is by nominating somebody who was pretty centrist in twenty twenty and not going to to the progressive extreme\nWell all the forces that we've seen in terms of the primary process in terms of campaign finance the things that are be leader the Republican Party some of the things I Believe those Republican Party also beleaguered the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think they are in the in the twenty twenty cycle the ... the Democrats might actually\nA nominate a centrist versus someone who's on the more progressive wing\nOr anything is possible I mean who would've imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump or twenty sixteen so we don't know who the Republican not who the Democratic nominee who's going to be twenty twenty but there is no question that almost all of the\nMajor contenders that people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees are certainly from the progressive wing of the party and that concerns me as as somebody who's uh who's more of a of a centrist center ripe a person\nYeah let's go to Joe who's calling from St Petersburg Florida Joe you're on the air\nAll right thank you um I guess my question how to do with the fact that a Christian I talked to a lot of my friends out and let me see strained politics most of my friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say that the Republican\nUh whereas um most of my other friends might be other combinations um art some type of a crab\nOr when I find that people that aren't really that are Republican but they they are minority whatnot it usually has to do with the money that they had one the other person\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nWent up our government is to make sure that everybody gets by everybody has the ability to either happiness\nOn my question what was the original point of having a conservative wing of the party back when you join and get it the ah the influence of the religious right in any way sway your decision to at the end of the\nJoke yeah Jo thanks for your call go ahead max\nWell the religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties uh and it's dismaying to me to see what happened with with with with that one of the party that you have until it goes I mean I agree with a lot of 'em in in the late Nineteen nineties when there were castigated Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these arch Moore listens colds who are criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions then you know this was a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off a playboy playmate on a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a\nPresident who has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of\nOf of a bill Bennett bark from Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen Ninety nine called the death of outrage where he was lamenting the fact that more people were not outraged\nAbout Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrage is actually a pretty good description of the ah of the of the Christian right or today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say about the shocking immorality of\nThe president that they support\n[noise] ... I Want to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's the question with this issue of race uh and and how that is shaped direction the Republican Party is going in because I I I'm thinking of\nUm you know the number of times you pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people looked upon and said that that was racist but\nDid you ... around him you know thinking of house Speaker Paul Ryan ... going so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks but but nevertheless I'm going to still support the United states because now he's ... he's helping deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important\nTo a lot of people so far as long as that you know your your term ... bargain exists what hope do you have\nA for change if the if the change has to come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated and devastating defeats they have to know there'll be a political price to pay\nFor trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political game there is nothing I've seen in American political life in my lifetime that as more despicable them is they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he's for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his racist baggage when he refers to Latino immigrants as snakes and animals who breathing in fast he calls African\nCountries [noise] you know he says neo Nazis or find people he locks up children of undocumented immigrants this this is a disgrace and the Republican Party is displacing itself by\nGoing along with those well\nLet's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Iowa you're on the air\n... backs food food I Would like to take my hat or if you're\nIdling turtle app probation up the courage to your show and the intelligence analysis you will absolutely correct about the current situation it can be no doubt and a woman integrity would face down from ...
