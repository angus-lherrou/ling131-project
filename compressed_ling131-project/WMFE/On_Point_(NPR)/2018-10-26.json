the nine eleven attacks he's been watching Saudi Arabia for almost Twenty years now and he's saying that it's time for Washington to really stop coddling\nThe Saudi kingdom where at one eight hundred and forty three eight to five by the eight hundred for two three talk a Senator Graham I Hope you can forgive me that I had to cut you off there before the break because um\nYou're telling us is very interesting story about a Saudi couple a young Saudi couple in Sarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now if I if I'm reading the reporting around this correctly\nThat they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers a ... and his license plate information was were on file 'em in the office of this gated community indicated maybe he'd been coming in and out\nAnd that leader on the FBI Tampa office had actually compiled of lay the reporter the with connections between the hijackers on this\nFor Ninety point at a news come some or land that will help to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care\nIncluding nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to their land up health dot COM port uh\nWe uh we which was a journalist and myself\nA ... ... ... filed a freedom of Information Act\nOr to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have any information on the three of flight students and the Saudi family or the judge rejected that as being a on\nBelievable uh they've in said that uh they uh had a a few documents a man and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily uh directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages of information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven\nSurvey of the situation in Sarasota\nOf with the judge them to determine what which of those eighty thousand pages could be made public\nA it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen or and after six years the judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand\nPages of can be made available to the American public okay\nSenator name I Want us take a step back here though because the ... year right to those ... eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of a Florida federal judge eighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota not yet made available to the public in any way shape or form but even before\nOr the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the uh those pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask for some of the reports at least um and did you you had to even go to the FBI is central record keeping office to even see\nSome of some of these reports and that uh and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nOh I Would say the FBI was being quite a on a cooperative in fact at one point a shortly after the\nSituation Sarasota was discovered uh my wife and I were a in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with her second daughter third daughter\nAnd uh we were intercepted at a\nLogan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there are and essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI or that we're wasting our time and that I should\nUh shut up and go oh you were the hair of\nThe nine eleven commission and the and the number two person at the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow the lead about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers and it it it almost five belief senator\nWell and it gets it gets worse uh so I uh\nI said I told the deputy director that the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so I did\nUh and uh the when I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have a had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again\nI'm I was wasting my time uh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI on the Sarasota a situation\nCenter [noise] nine eleven [noise]\nYou know we were Seventeen years out and\nAnybody who was alive and remembers that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and\nAnd I'm hearing you tell me that the FBI as late as two thousand eleven was actively try to dissuade you from a you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and then we said before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within its possession information it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening\nWell out of the mystery is a over three administrations why has there been this uh\nUh reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they wanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nAre raised the possibility that another nation state uh was responsible ran counter to that narrative uh the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had run in two thousand eight in large part on his opposition to the war in Iraq and\nHad raised questions about the\nAbout Saudi Arabia and why it was a more a focus of attention but uh in spite of that and nothing was done in his administration or to expedite the release of information on nine eleven and now\nA President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darling of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president has been very Folsom in his ah statements of\nApproval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no of\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven\nYeah and I'm going to take a couple of quick call your senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official report so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this thought um that no one no official report saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean would you go so far as to say that you have seen\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] some more front point comes from the listeners have W.

center\nIs also an expert in treating rare autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system and he's already treated eight patients with acute\n... uh my latest this year Dr Greenberg welcome to implant thank you might not happy to be here\nSo first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to to science we've seen it before [noise]\nYou're correct in the facts are also we are part of the issue relative to some confusion so\nWhen we talk about acute ... it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children\nBut it can affect adults are there are multiple ways to damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen every other year\nIn the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike\nIn number of children who have become paralyzed with this type of a condition of ... and the suspicion has been that during the season ... every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that that's an intro virus\nIt is that's the suspicion or be entering viruses are a group of viruses that are very common uh usually cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild\nUh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an honor of ours and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold and then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing me some quite worrying headlines about polio likes him as\nA in some children who were being infected with this and you say that um we started started seeing a spike beginning in in two thousand four teams so ah but the editor of virus wasn't wasn't leading to the same symptoms before that\nSo it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the\nCalifornia Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated acute ... by white as patients and when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference\nBetween two dollars and ten\nFor Ninety point have the news comes some more land out how they're whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six patients parenting more information is that to their land on health dot com\nSymptoms of syndrome a looks essentially like polio ... which\nWas described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about the polio virus as the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states the syndrome of polio ... which look almost identical\nA with a few unique features between them the polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but we think uh there have been a background of rare\nParalytic events mainland kids happening for several decades but something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand twelve two thousand four team\nAnd so that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nThat we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern\nOr where we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes a for these outbreaks in the late summer early fall and\nWhat's notable is the the virus that has received the most attention um which was within the family of ... viruses\nAll of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus in any of these cases when testing has been done in a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay so this is where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I said earlier that\nThese viruses are also very common and ... and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but if but if they're still kind of I don't know that there is no current vaccines for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there\nA correct there is no are available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay I'm a research just wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path of developing one\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in isn't trying to prove causation so that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine\nWe're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for and so where our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus among researchers in public health officials that we think we have the right\nCulprit and it turns out that ah the virus or family viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate\nAnd difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy and so often will have children who have the syndrome of ... negative\nBased on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for but it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um when we would test\nThe spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating their spinal cord and causing damage\nAnd affecting the nerves that control the muscles\nWe can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus to find\nAnd so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so if you have a child with paralysis in you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus\nWe don't look to the final quarter the spinal fluid because we can't find that we have to look elsewhere in the body and so we're trying to sort out the same process to use for the editor of ours is now the the reassuring part of this relative to the history of polio virus\nIt's been a full two years since we first tried are less intrusive style

P. way right which was really human centered really employ centric it was a great place to work and to stay um\n... Packard right at Packard and then ... and David Packard right they had a whole management theory about management by walking around they handed a profit share quite a bit with their employees I mean it was it was the standard of an end looking would turn into a blue chip companies right no longer but [laughter]\nBut it was at the top of the heap once the garage that ... that the bill and Dave H. P. and as a national landmark right\nAnd and they the one thing I I loved about uh two they would have a big picnic for the whole company once a year and your family's in there and they view the company as a family and they\nThe two of them would serve all the hamburgers you know they would serve certain people are sort of symbolic but but you know there's a certain humility to it and they wanted people to stay for their entire careers they bought\nLand for employees to go camping in or a you know for recreation in different parts of the world where they had officers there were really much very much about the people in their country then the next wave in the seventies\nAnd eighties you have this sort of counter cultural way we have like the jobs in Wozniak kind of thing and when I came into covering tech\nIn the late eighties it was still kind of hippy ... be counter cultural pro people was a great place to work if you landed a job and one of these places like oh\nFantastic and that has radically\nChanged and that's no longer you know [noise] that kind of place it's it's very stressful\nYeah well did he can't just jump in here saying 'cause we've got a caller who was who's talking exactly this about um the value of employees are in this day and age that let me just get his say here Robert is calling from Omaha Nebraska Robert you're on the air\nWell\nNo it was saying that the value of unemployed ... an electric when you're a transactional issue can return to other news fine but it's not the start and there's nothing there's nothing new or just returning back before\n... it ...\nRobert thank you so much for your call a deadlines what do you think about that means he's kind of thing when I said earlier that a lot of the sounds really familiar\nIt it it does in a way I'm ... ... I went back in ... I Want to read books by industrialists of of a previous generation and see what they what they thought so I read Henry Ford's memoirs and read Thomas watching junior who was the c._e._o. of IBM\nAnd a Lee Iacocca so it's not the rubber bands but and and Henry Ford obviously was not a nice guy yeah have you get to the very end of it and I'm watching this last shop and you're like\nOh my God whoa whoa whoa but be before that part of it it's amazing he's saying I Am doing this to try to create as many jobs for as many human beings as I can\nAnd to treat them really well um he at one point had his staff around and try to find jobs that disabled people could do because those people were pushed out of the workforce by me all the jobs you could do if you only had one on by me all the jobs you could do if you were blind\nMake a list and then we're going to go higher those people so they can work and they can uh they can make make a living yeah\nBut at this so this is the key difference though right that there was a time\nI'm a ... not for every company but for many companies the point was to grow the company\nAnd doing so involved in trying to be the best employer they could be but ... ... you know some time in the seventies and eighties we American Capitalism turned over to shareholder value creation that that was the ultimate goal of the company to serve the interests of shareholders\nSo wouldn't that be and and I guess what I'm saying when I'm Wondering is it in your book are you writing that you think\nThat that Silicon Valley because it's full\nAnd they are there is hope there and these guys are a big part of it\nWe were talking about dandelions he's author of lab rats how Silicon Valley made work miserable for the rest of us on the Williams is also with us this hour joining us from San Francisco she's cofounder of\nZebras unite an organization that calls for more ethical and inclusive start up and venture capital culture and we want to hear from you do you think the worst place practices and eat those of\nBig Silicon Valley companies is spreading into your work wherever you are in America is that a good thing or a bad thing real one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk I'm going to hear from a lot of college and we come back to stick with us making talk her body doesn't on point [noise]\nYou are listening to Ninety point seven news I'm Nicole dark and crashed and and your forecast cloudy conditions tonight with a thirty percent chance of scattered showers overnight and lows in the lower seventies for tomorrow rain chances stay high throughout the day at about fifty percent with the possibility of some heavier storms\nAfternoon temperatures reaching into the upper eighties and overnight lows tipping back to around Seventy degrees daytime temperatures drop to around eighty for the weekend\nSupport for Ninety points other news comes from the USS College of public health preparing students who share a belief in the common good and a passion for improving the public's health offering certificate\nBachelor master and doctoral degree programs in online on campus and blended format more information is available online at public health dot U.

Amazon warehouses are not like that um ... when he mentioned I'm\nIn Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple of years was and Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he offered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in his company and\nI'm Sorry [laughter] and I thought it like what do we come and even the BCS I call it that is the most just hoping thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise]\nAnyway but yeah there are there is a lot of dystopian stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well any of them let me just ask you briefly a are we ... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we ... ...\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nOr they're actually maybe medium or smaller size or come the tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and\nYou know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the bitter with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much but at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and out of\n... ... ... because I mean because with knowledge work the asset is the worker writings that it's not the workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor is that's that's the lover that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down was quickly in order to\nA massage a profit for that quarter I just cut a workforce or do you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of a company or\nThe workers themselves so my question you new to you India is that ... in trying to shift perspective a little here um for for these tech companies or for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowered them or a ... that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nYeah I think it has to have to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so I mentioned earlier you know awareness and attention ... kind of a two things that keep coming up for me\nSo a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male champ as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps and they never raised any venture capital they're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now\nUm and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it\nTo me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another an example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share the private company um but they share a olive their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they wanted to be able to build it more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that\nThey are the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there for\n'em and then I'd also say like again to companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate in the success of that company as well so everyone has invested in this excessive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead
