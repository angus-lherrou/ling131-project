Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nPanel on climate change as commissioned by the United nations or which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage during an interview with on point on Tuesday drew ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explained that past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative\nAnd that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe've seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of feet exchange go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or if ... if anything been kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realized we would back in the eighties\n[noise] total ... uh how is the government responding to this a panel just at this report\nI without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives that much for the policy and the federal government there's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know\nTry to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nAh isn't is racing has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pull out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states in agreement that basically all of the countries in the world a agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact than the onset of of climate change uh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and ah as he says putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\n[noise] ah I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the air\nI thanks for taking my call Yes sir I think the I think the biggest driver of climate change is denial but people in their everyday lives to turn away from it there's no bigger issue in this report or anything\nTells me that people who claim to say that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing enforcing those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a Bob uh Alexis I'm asked totally what actions have been taken a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\nWell I you know one element of the un report was bored out immediately and the reaction as as you're questioning and and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell\nWent around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and ah the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are\nDiscovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if this report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big\nYou know cricket makes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas of the issues at stake are quite dire need this was an issue obviously weird on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in other new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine\nOr Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing in that has already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House ah and at that time the newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh shirt Americans he would be an independent impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of\nThe Supreme Court's team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one answer is but to serve one nation America's constitution and laws protect every person of\nEvery belief and every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nJack Beatty you've heard the new justice or can you uh feel assured that he'll listen to the litigants arguments with respect or an open mind well\nHe had to say that didn't he based on who is a\nLittle ... in front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except bin ... come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nAh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him a lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough to challenge this poses to the GOP or some people call it the grand oil party which has deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames Hansen the climate scientist in recent paper says here we will go to negative admissions now basically or\nWe will have to invest eighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pull the carbon in the atmosphere out partly through developing\nAs yet unheard of technologies what does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need the universal health care\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from their costs at a party that caused by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as part while we're in we're concerned about the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization all crisis\nElections emitting or is there any sense going back to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that ah that that the Republicans will pay a price for a for cabinet are what they did it now look as though there'll be a little bit just by the the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to

five ... hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook\nAt on point radio uh one of our callers are called to admonished us for spending time on Kanye West visit to the White House at all but I think it's part of a piece of understanding where are the president is coming from what's on his mental landscape what does he sharing with us\nHe also had some a sharp words at a rally a in Council Bluffs Iowa on Tuesday the president had harsh words for those who oppose him\nHand match during our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats [noise]\nWe've heard a lot of rhetoric from Republicans about the Democrats in their ... where's this rhetoric coming from [noise]\nWell yeah and you know let's just get it for the ... called the Democrats evil the party of crime they want to destroy our country liberals are quote very very bad people\nYou know in the October nineteenth two thousand sixteen debate the president was ... then candidate Trump was asked will you will abide by the results of the election\nAnd he said I Will look at it at the time I Will keep you in suspense it could be rigged\nNow we have to be in suspense about two thousand and twenty is it likely that the president will turn over power should the Democrats win to a party that is what destroying our country very very evil\nYou know if we've reached the point where this sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is ed Lu ...\nWhat happens writing in the Financial Times you know lead to imagine Trump refusing to accept election defeat\nThat that's a along step from where we are\nBut certainly the rhetoric is charged he's talking about mob rule elect to some degree you've been hearing that from a congressional figure some of them on Capitol Hill as well what are you hearing that's driving that rhetoric what did they point to an end ... you know what is it really grounded on\nWell first of all when we first started to hear this discussion about an angry mob it was a talking point it was very clear because Republicans including the president were all speaking with the same voice so it had been focus grouped with a talking point and posters were suggesting that Republicans would profit by doing this\nAnd part of this is because an election season no matter what party you're and you're trying to draw very sharp contrast and mobilize your own base to turn out and we know that Republicans\nHad been very concerned that their base is not as mobilize turned six sided about turning out in the mid term election\nAs Democrats may be so\nLike I don't like yeah let me just stop you there to help underscore your point er during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend or Lehigh Valley resident Dorothy nickloes told our my co host magnet chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protests from Democrats\nDemocratic Party stopped so far to the left and\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus a socialist and the global [noise]\nPeople could sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around with

being from birth to adult had including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations to central Florida family more information including locations at Arlington health dot com slash kids\nIs affecting the state's hotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point radio dot org but electric to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of mobs and simply that people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly as a constitutional right that's hardly seems like ... to me\nWell it is that it sparked a debate about what is our\n... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line and of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself is very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nAre often inside a mob reaction himself\nBut I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to drop sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race at in New York and defeated a Joe Crowley long term incumbent\nAnd ... is running as a socialist that there were a lot of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rub together in the Republican Party about wow we can really use this because the effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being\nPulled to the left to the left to the left and you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are anticipating perhaps running for president or in these house races that fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's a tension and it's almost as though there is seen as in parallel but sounds kind of different to me about pension about whether to be pulled it left\nA among Democrats and you've seen that play on some congressional primaries and races\nAnd also tension about how strongly teach you fight for a you know political success or earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates these the Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later\nWhen I say you know we don't do anything for ... you'll do anything illegal\nBut we're going to be tough and we got to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king when the young you know almost all gave to us that can be taken away\nThat's the thing to do they want to maintain\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams a ... in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose he uh they said you know this is wildly inappropriate he further clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the ... the little the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty eight teams\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condoned and the un incite violence uh and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on in these final weeks of the election because as a lecture said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence of Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president\nTo turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama's sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hadn't and that Republicans have had with hard line tax tactics like\n[noise]\nI'm David Folkenflik coming up next our on point broad claims of voter fraud and

in Georgia Stacey Abrams has spent her her years as late as an activist registering residents to vote for opponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state and I think there's a really unusual consequence of careers focused on the issue of voting right at the ballot box right\nStacey Adams appeared Abrams excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday discuss the tens of thousands of registration applications currently on hold in the state of Georgia she's accused her home in blind camp of repressing citizens right to vote\nThat challenge is this process called the exact match and we've been fighting had on this sets twenty fourteen what happens is is that he had a hyphen in your last name if he had a difficult spelling if anyone misspelled or lose leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically as a reason\nTo not process your registration and that means that about fifty three thousand Jordan's currently have their registration intending status\nTechnically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not processed and so we're deeply worried at fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election\n[noise] a ... hotel me uh what would Brian Kemp say if he were here and uh how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to travel now I'd like to hear it handles someone like um brand capital\nSupport for Ninety planes and the news comes from Orlando house Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospitals and children had been caring for the children and teenagers in central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nOn whether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor type like a missing Heisman or the transportation of two letters on a someone's entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing that underscore I think there's um the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote in November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that is not a perfect solution\nBecause provisional ballots are counted under different rules um been regular ballots but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged\nI'd like to take a call now from away cross Georgia a John go ahead you're on the air\nYes I was calling about the uh the um now when you saw your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license information in to get your tax return process\nIncluding earned income credit and other credits that the people that you are saying are being disenfranchised um how's that because they want to get those refunds so so I don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThink you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nI had to retire you might call yesterday\nWhat bothers me is and it's rarely discussed is the fact that every one of these voter ID laws is always tied to serious restrictions to access to the polls\nEither reducing the polling places pulling time um when they're clerks offices are open to file absentee ballots which was the case here in ... in Wisconsin so there is there it's not just about ... it seems to me that undermines his argument it's about voter fraud it's about reducing people's rights to vote\nThank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help or address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state for the state of Alabama it's taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters\nHad been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcomed on point\nDavid great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYou sir tell me just from the ... what's your approach to uh to to having voters on the roles\nWell David we will each and every eligible US citizen this resident of Alabama\nTo be registered to vote and have a photo lab date and we have gone to extra links to make sure that people are accommodate whenever that occurs\nAnd we did our six seven counties at least one time every year with our mobile units as well as having our board registrars office opened each and every day that the court houses open in all six to seven county\nAnd we visit festivals events in activities in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one now I Would also tell you that in the rare instances where people say\nHey I Can't get to the board registrars office because my work schedule or I Can't get to one of the mobile unit location\nBecause it's not convenient or I don't go to the events for festivals\nIn those rare occasions where that has happened David we're going to people's homes and we have given them photo lab they and their homes and we're very excited about what we've achieved during the last three years and then much and twenty three days it I've had the privilege to be Alabama sectors state\nWaiver edge one million Ninety five thousand eight hundred and sixty one new voters and we now have three million four hundred and thirty four thousand eight hundred and sixty three registered voters in Alabama those numbers are unprecedented and empire loud and the history of the state\nWhat's the need for the for the voter id\nWell the reason that I voted for David Was because I Want to make it easy to vote and hard to see if you need an ad day when you open a bank account if you're needing that day when you go to the movie if you need an ad they when you buy six pack of beer or if you buy a pack of cigarettes\nThen you ought to be able to present and not be when you exercise the most precious rat that we have\nEnough to participate in our Democrat Republican is a vote\nI wanted to take a briefly a general I Want to take a call from a nearby states from Louisiana New Orleans I've Sharon on the line ... ... a share your thoughts on this\nHi thank you for taking my call Manhattan in Louisiana\nYou had to show on I have an id whichever voter registration um for ... years with an ear which is over twenty\nHow were they the ID now it's changed you have to have a real id to vote and then we'll ID it requires you to a show a birth certificate Social Security card and to um for the president said to document\nUm but they don't tell you you need that you\nKnow find out about the real ID I can tell you go and get your driver's license renewed it so if you're not in the uh schedule it get your driver's license renewed but for the next time your vote then you realize you need a real ID and ah you won't be able to do\nSo I think Sharon and Sharon thank you so much for that I appreciate that John Merrill you're suckers date in Alabama ... some of the specifics interest 'cause he's maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless in order to David in his serve it\nTo remember that they vary from state to state I mean we have ten different elements that can be chained to use when you go to vote

different perspective we got a call from Baltimore, Maryland at go ahead\nI thanks for taking my call you I just wanted to say that you know I I wrote at first but I was Eighteen years old I'm sixty years old I've never missed a vote even when I was up in the military I was out of town travelling I think it's a question of taking the extra effort to make sure that my vote counted\nThank you so much for the call and I can verify that accent is truly from Baltimore or we've also got a call from Alex or from Charleston South Carolina go right ahead\n... follow up and that previous caller's comment or might have been in the number and I find that it has become very difficult for a service members to register it especially laugh and then it on some of the younger servicemen numbers are frustrated because they don't have 'em\nThey no longer have their own state id they move to different 'cause he fiction and received drivers like\nIn other states and in their home states do not

all fifty eight for creating such a huge gap in allowing him and now\nAlex you so much for sharing that perspective I really appreciate it one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about today's voter fraud in part because there's so little evidence that really happens I think that there was one survey done something like eight hundred million\nVotes cast over a fourteen year period and their works maybe scores of of of of allegations that seem credible maybe a hundred or two hundred a ... but that that concern wall talked about a lot particularly twenty sixteen raised by the president and a lot of his supporters\nThere really isn't a lot of evidence to support that nonetheless such as we've all it tested there is a desire to ensure that people legitimately have the right to vote in these things when ... when the wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill ... state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well so\nI Want it to build up with the last caller talked about the the difficulty of at least many Americans to register to vote and um the secretary marrow was very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree\nThat it should be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls and with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... at a modernized the system so it's not just relying on\nAds and papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices but we're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem I'm Thirteen states in DC have already adopted that in the last three years alone and there's been a really bipartisan support in momentum and it really works to\nExpand voter registration and to do so much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary Merrill about um whether he is I'm interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWhere a windy outside\nSupport for Ninety points in the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando

I think it's something that everybody needs to know\nI also think it's important to note when it comes to automatic voter registration which is what you're talking about there's a different definition for what automatic voter registration means to certain people\nNow one of the questions that are raised whenever somebody introduces the concept to me is it do you believe that if you have automatic registration in your state but there should be an opt out provision\nAnd knocked out provision would mean there's somebody says no I Do want to be registered than they should be given the opportunity to keep from being registered when they engage in that activity would be getting in your driver's license getting social services or whether it happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I immediately tell us what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we had nine to three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very very excited about this\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's\nEver been in a system where you have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and that the yield of very very different levels of participation in the abstract you might think that those things\nAren't very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of audience system through the DMV right now\nOther states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates sky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that used to create an opt out supposed\nTo we're getting a colors were suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid things you take one call and\nWindy day of tickets or you know if you if that ugly um what would you think do potentially creating a holiday whether it be a state holiday or even to propose that perhaps the national level to\nUm have an official day off for voting and whether or not they'd be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually vote\nOr I'll take the response off the air thank you\nThanks very secretary Barry I think it's important to know that it's\nBeen my observation in my experience people vote when it's important to\nAnd if you say well if we had voting on Saturday of what had voting on a day they specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase the turnout well we've broken every record the history of the state and the last three major elections we've had the empirical data and they all said speaks for itself\nWhich is that people come when they want to vote\nWe took it took three ... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously ... turnout is actually Yes sir I'm Sorry state Folkenflik or ... you know there's obviously really interest to win one more in the ...
