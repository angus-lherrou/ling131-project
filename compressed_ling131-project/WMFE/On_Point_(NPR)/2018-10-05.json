all important teenage years later how has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nOf course ... response as well so here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet here about specific phrases that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book\nDevil's triangle during junior Hauser play three glasses and trying and your point quarters no gr supporters here\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nBecause nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence of this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh's mouse during his testimony a devil's triangle is a common slang phrase for a three ...\nAnd uh it's a it's a sexual time and uh in\nBrett Kavanaugh's testimony he tried to paint himself he tried to the reason this is important because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself\nAs a kind of innocent and high school he said he was a Virginia but to charge you volunteer soup kitchen he\nHelped intellectually disabled children\nAnd this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy it was totally out of touch with the person that he was not devil's triangle is actually\nA a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the more important ones are like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern and that is one example of a huge patterns in which Brett Kavanaugh evaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college us has to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of a guy\nAnd ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the Senate to know that and so he didn't admit or any of the things of that suggested that he did actually no LBJ and think about sex in high school and uh things that would make for out of gives you more credible\nWell uh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kavanaugh said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to ... an actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly remove later but\nBut Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you just said let me just push you on this a little bit because we also see\nUm I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so who has been pushed to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper part in this moment is that he can he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to\nYou know what might I I don't know what might be like kind of a junkie things that Seventeen year old boys say to each other because it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something much much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think\nThe hyper partisanship of the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things\nThe problem is the best thing called a sworn oaths and you take it when you testify in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh as a federal judge and he's speaking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty the whole point is that you have to it's a it's sworn\nTestimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you would look more credible in fact that's entirely the point the reason that he lied about these things\nI'm is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it would hurt a him in his attempt to make Christine Ford looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd it's a green what he said\nI watch can hands because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd P TST symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and it's quite possible\nThat though she may have been assaulted it was ... and I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been hand the proof or in the number of people you have one person saying\nHe was this type of person and then I hear people like a Nathan Robbins and saying things like nobody's ever heard of history and came everybody knew well those are not factual statements we have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House I tested his character sixty five women from high school saying we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like\nThat I that that seems to be discounted which bothers me\nAs a person is really interested in the truth and sneezing statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew as an example of bad faith analysis and in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and his examples of why this drinking a mentally he says it means which I find kind of filthy minded honestly\nIs nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which we didn't have a Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have the I I wasn't in the DC area in Nineteen eighty three\nI but that means he's lying and the additional proof is a nation's ... Davis who went to high school in the DC area\nIn two thousand eight\nThat's not true and I don't think that is even just crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know ... Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that in the Internet age devil's triangle now means sustain is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about this drinking game\nNathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that\n... yeah I mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this thing ah the procedure for having us testimony you know I have a discussion I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and the most major lives are much much much more significant ah\nLike saying I never attended a gathering with the people for that sense\nNow on his calendar on Thursday July first he attended a gathering with the people that Ford says he attended a gathering with when he said all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen in fact one of the ... and he's he ... he says Ford's friend Leyland Kaiser\nSays that this didn't happen that's not what my own Kaiser says Leyland Kaiser says she believed Dr Ford which means that did happen it was a misrepresent actually it would be awesome if she believed belief does not mean that it did happen just to be what she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that sounds really that it didn't happen\nShe believes that it happened right her opinion if that forward is telling the truth\nRight not that it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen that full that's a false statement that the false representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's false he did we know from his talented\nAggressive appliances a deeper commitment to appliances and the people who

trucker body we're talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words\nAgain we're not looking at the ... once said contemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should sort of on the United States Supreme court and we're joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my editor green she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist\nAt real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more a moment from last week this is in a ... an exchange with\nA that the judge Kavanaugh had with senator Amy Klobuchar Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I Know I remember what happened\nAnd I think you're probably a beer sir and\nSo you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nTo us or asking about young black I don't I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course those people remember just Kevin uh after a break came back and apologize to senator clover sharks\nAnd agreeing to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the Weekly Standard pod cast a day after or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that um quote even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breast ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore\n... ... what's your response to that I think the fact\nThat he apologized to center ... churches he felt that he had come across as too aggressive\nThat I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process the sort of you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be very lovely reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human 'cause really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kinda damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech\nTo make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person who's going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in our justice system then we're going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robbins who said cagey\nUh but if she is colloquial unjust and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened\nAnd the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen which is a click away of saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so I think it's important to remember is a human I\nThink this moment showed that he's a human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice Nathan your take\nWorld what are called colloquial I call false right ... ... just misrepresenting the fact that but I I should cagey for a reason I mean he's a direct questions like\nI'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says I was number one in my class in high school well that that's not an answer to the question right and and ...\nSupport for Ninety points

information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nRents against Brett Kavanaugh is why it's so important for him to be honest and to answer those questions directly\nNobody's going to hold it against him if he says look\nI I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the few clubs like uh because I I drank a lot and you know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates of your time to talk to a dozen of his your costs money to all say\nThat he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college um and and and and they say that they say that directly wherever his freshman year roommate who said he was a belligerent drunks\nUm we have the uh University of Washington I'm head of the a gun to call me on hold your department who said I used to drink with Brett\n... it's not credible she said it is not a credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes is different from how he remembered the night before that's what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who are budgeted by the way they handled watched him all say that's just not credible he he he listed in his high school yearbook he's part of the city club that tried to get through a hundred K. eggs in a year\nBut you know in March judges memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart ... who is your view everywhere\nUm and he wouldn't even admit that he was barred cabinet off um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will that's full you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that's also when you\nLook at let's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the air Nathan\nAre you a thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I did great the great Kavanaugh was lying and I was three so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted\nThe allegations about and that wasn't true\nI also talk to the claim that there was a Clinton revenge thing going on as over the top accusations but I don't think the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not a ... he led regardless of if you will your doctor for it or not\nI don't think that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lying to Congress back when he was getting a lot of attention from Iraq Iran\nAnd none of the Republicans are scared about it or want to do at the end and I don't think they do now\nAnd measuring the group of people support each other and all I followed it barrier ironic because they have the phrase stand with Kavanaugh because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker and my experience was that the political slogan used to cover up for on trustworthy versus\nWell about look people there's a hashtag I stand with Christine I mean stand with so and so it seems to be a very very common way of expressing support for whoever it is that you express support for Nathan\nI'm okay I'll I'll I'll open up that far but we are you a lot of yard signs saying a stand with Walker and white that somebody who's not trustworthy so when you actually have a science thing that was it was kind of law I'm like oh my gosh\nOkay over again Nathan thank you for your call and it's a green let me turn back to you I think Nathan is broader point is that he doesn't feel that no matter you know whether that that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that to judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but\nIn ... he sees the whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress at all or congressional Republican and they're going to a they're going to confirm him anyway and uh he he objects to that but what's your response to Nathan\nWell actually what nation is saying that he sees a line of lives and that's much stronger than misstatements I mean I I as a more trying to see this more objectively I say well maybe he did make misstatements\nUm I don't think that that for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink and high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he said in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd in his calendar you know you look at a statement like oh well they said that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described there is no gathering that says that leave when Carter was there who also said I don't know him I didn't go to parties with him Dr Ford

what you think about college drinking culture now ah and again as we talked about before\nBefore the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if you're in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you were at\nEight hundred forty three eight to five five as I said and we got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website ah for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town and my residence is surrounded by college housing\nThursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's difficult to see dozens upon dozens of weeding drunk students can racks of course the next party\nA until the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed this shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest in this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York\nHe's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research at high risk alcohol consumption in college students for three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you\nThank you very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this this story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus or drinking culture now ... are we at a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think uh what what I was hearing from them is not something I'm calling you will hear students or\nOr even graduate says they reflect back to have to say um we're in many ways though are not at a very different place than we were\nEven going back Thirty years ago if I might say a quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campuses based on [noise] uh scores and scores of studies the overarching in irrefutable\nFindings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking\nIt is significant and sometimes quite tragic and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're out their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old\nAnd those as compared to any other age population and compared to non college young adults are the same age ... this is the heart of the of the problem\nIs when we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk\nThose levels have declined to slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains\nHaving said that even given the relative high rates of problem drinking college\nIs not now nor has ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students\nThe best measures of a two ... of of of high risk drinking or about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally and iris drinking with some frequency about twenty percent\nMight be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers\nAnd it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students consume two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on a campus was true across all all dark young two campuses we've researched one quarter of students\nAre consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that consume so the harvest drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious problem can I have a significant grew\nYeah so so it was a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe you said it but I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that well uh sometimes\nToday with the word a binge drinking issues and typically what is used most commonly and measures are measures such as using\nFive or more drinks that are sitting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise] more recent decades that we have better measures that focus on you used to talking about drinking five or four more in a two hour period because\nThat is sitting sometimes we're college students mind mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nAh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol levels up\nTo a high risk level such as a point oh eight which was the I'm a legal limit in terms of driving when a ... one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas and that's a so if we're talking about drinking\nA five or more in a two hour period without intention of some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yeah so what I think is interesting\nAbout what the difference may potentially be if we can talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades that\nThere does seem to be at least ... hard alcohol which when I'm stuck into my parents were people from previous generations seems to be different people's shocked that there are just handles of October or whatever he needs to get hold of\nEasily available sit back basically right off the bat your freshman year\nAnd I don't know maybe ... or jak find that to be somewhat experience their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[noise] yeah um I think there's probably a fifty fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking heart alcohol or beer on depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for um hell gates before football game tended to be more beer\nBeer Hetty whereas party toasted after attorneys for you know whatever that tended to be more um hard liquor centric do I think that's definitely a notable point okay and Jack\nFor three decades and we want to know what you think we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk\nWhat is drinking culture on college campuses like today is it the problem is it's the same as it was Thirty years ago or\nYou know are where we are politically in terms of how we talk about sexual assault in terms of the reality of social media has that changed with the factors are when we consider what is appropriate drinking culture on college campuses I make a trucker party give us a call ... one eight hundred\nFor two three eight to five five to some point [noise]\nThanks I listening to Ninety point seven units and Danielle prior and I hope you're having a great end of your week\nLet's take a look

one year old senior at Boston College we end up ... joins us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's a first year law student\nAt the George Washington University School of law\nJak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges he's been conducting research\nOn high risk alcohol consumption for several decades where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about to return to eat\nAnd the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find it shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna\nSo that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nIt's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself\nNow insofar as me being shocked that\nStudents who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just\nLet me just talked to Madeline and ... and Jack here I mean respond to what's what Stevens saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you\nIs it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people are used to relieve stress because I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major ways to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress or to grow with your friends and have a couple of drinks like brown was saying you got on Thursdays there'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks\nThere's ... there's not like people are going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm gonna go blackout tonight and give us some more of like you just it catches up on me but you go to a party and there's like\nThere's all call there and you started drinking drinking and then you walk out but it was a million different ways to relieve stress the bug me out is not a common one I Would say\nOK so Brianna against even are being says ah why do you find a shocking to you that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak there are a million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a how ... that he can go for Iran or you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for a school or work or out of the things that are\nLaying down on you or alter like that and go out with a couple of friends after class and he'd grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and saying you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nGood some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatricians are committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\n... of the time um at least not now in law school an undergrad one needy your responsibilities weren't as much as they are for me now um you might go out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat in that but certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to drive different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least\nIn my license blackout just kind of used almost colloquially like you you you're like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means that kind of on normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nWe've got like as to what the comment on line said\nI don't like I don't know that\nWe are all blacking out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language out in a way that it might not have been before [noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the ironic uh\nHi thank you for taking my call um I just uh from here I already graduated from college and here in all and the drinking scene as crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street and that kind of like dry the party theme of the nation but\nI just feel like sometimes people are a little a sheen she speak truthfully about really what goes on and drinking and it almost sounds like it's that choice\nTo go out when I've seen people blackout it doesn't seem to me like they do it on purpose they just got to a point where they can't control that drinking anymore so I guess my question would be\nDo you think that it's always up to you whether you're going to blackout or not or if it's more that you get to a certain point where you just can't control and that's when\nThings with what we can with Josh comment on it are happening and maybe people will say like oh maybe I can remember or maybe that's like just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like\nI don't know it's just like lie and basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the cakes and everything like that I had to be a blackout and from what your guest\nAre they speaking ... it's like corroborating that if my ... you can't control that you're going to get to that point right time\nVeronica thank you for your call jak McCarthy my turn to you on that uh I mean you heard the question what do you say\n[noise] um I definitely say for the blackouts especially I think we're missing important too to\nSome people do they have like bigger issues that nobody knows about too sometimes they do go out to drink and like kind of forget about their problems so I think that's also like another reason people are walking out of there because they have issues that you don't exactly know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out at the bars\nThey have other issues and the the um ... because they are trying to cover up those issues Wesley Perkins what what's your response to that question well\nI think the if if if you start from they are going to a party are going to a ... bar point of view first full of that is only as a segment of the population but you observe the people who are the most extreme and you go home and we're talking with your friends and have stories about\nUh the person who passed out on the dance floor or who started a fight\nOr who uh got sick or do you have to clean them up and that sort of thing and we have millions of uh stories about them and it can be funny it can be so it can be scary and so forth but we talked about is what most of the talk is about\nAnd understandably these these are situations of concern in many instances [noise]\nBut when we talk about them so much and we have thousands of words for being intoxicated but only two or three for not being intoxicated moderation being sober abstinence but you can think of thousands of words for being drunk", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)",
