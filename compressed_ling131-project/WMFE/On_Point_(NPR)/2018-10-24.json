M. F. it's been a fool two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising cold it's fine with Dr and this is how we do it now have you been happy family\nDon't your support for uninterrupted programming but donating a dollar a day W. M. F. U. dot org or cold wanting hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nCents so the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Martha mix Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the books that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people are finding themselves and how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answers that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash a record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is that the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance and you have to regulate the plants and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good uh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good at figuring out how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage\nTo somebody who has a preexisting condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people\nWho have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full range of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone\nEven if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing condition\nSo the problem with the Republicans have done when confronted with this when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about they may not be happy\nWith everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they like that protection for pre existing conditions so they put in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop\nOr insurance companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen by Republicans whether it's to house repeal bill that mix Sally voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley\nFloats in an op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will seize on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people have cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than you\nDo man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because\nI think it's easy to um rally around ... popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as as we've been talking about the health care and this this country is so complicated that even when someone you knew who says well versed in it as Jonathan Cohn tries to explain well goes about explaining\nThe you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean is it is a debate on the campaign trail getting to to that level that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does um how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick example I've covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly okay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb\nOf one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before highly began speaking was telling me about their child that had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions and he collars Holly and asked them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this\nAnd Holly's giving the answer and I told you sang and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the foreign ... this official seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues [noise]\nFast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally now these are all Republican loyalists\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave a speech and I went over and asked her what she asked them about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about pre existing conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do that and that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at\nPart of an event where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWill will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general how we had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer does he believe him yes okay so So Jonathan code that's this this is a perfect example because I\nI Want to know it can because of the complications of healthcare um ... is it possible that no matter how hard Democrat hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P\nThat when a those same GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nWell you know we'll see we'll see in November I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said I'm as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confused people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say X or y but\nHealthcare is one of those dishes where I think instinctively you ask your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your health care which like cares more about healthcare instinctively people associate that with the Democrats now they\nMay they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about that um they think Democrats raise taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know at a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people wanna keep and that's Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing and\nThat's all we have a we even have a Fox News pull the recent Fox News fall from just within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare a gift and you know and if you look at when it did you know it did to Africa Affordable Care act became ... after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] ... point comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and your NPR station\nFrom legal zoom dot com offering a network of independent attorneys and tax

making a trucker Bertie we are talking about health care in the mid term elections and how much this one issue\nMaybe on voters' minds as they cast their ballots are in two thousand Eighteen I'm doing today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering see a healthcare social welfare and politics and let's go to the phones here because of Lance\nIs on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois Lance you're on the air\nOh yeah I've been self employed for ah twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety five been dealing with this whole healthcare thing for many many years and I I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago\nFor all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama came into effect I could no longer buy health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount\nSo to say that the Democrats have gotten a better job on health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it all I have to share ministry ministry type of a contract\nLive under Obamacare\nYeah can't see a quick question that you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nSo I'm kind of you know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle there there is still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to uh pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nYeah Lance thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn uh this is I think is this is absolutely the other side of the major health care or challenges that we have in the United states it and the people like labs are right that\nThat we still have the problem the spiraling cost and that it the AC didn't cover everyone who needs assistance with health care so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about preexisting conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\n[noise] yeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming\nOf the Affordable CARE Act\nUm you know if you go but you know the the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available only available to people in good health and it had lots of gaps in it frankly the people who had insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial\nThere whereas in your lifetime limit on policies I I on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you did get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill said forego care comes and says we're going to change all that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover you know all the things that employer policy would cover\nAnd that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it\nWell what happened was in a ...\nFor people who are poor or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part I'm as income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and uh your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who's now facing just on affordable health insurance\nAnd is looking for alternative so the question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was do you just take away where do you say All right we need to give those people like your caller to same kind of access to coverage that people who are lower income happy right give them more subsidies just treat you open up Medicare Medicaid\nTo them visa you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward\nBut isn't the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation all I hear is should repeal replace or or preserve you know it'll be having a substitute\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of maybe point seven W. M. S. it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising cold it's fine with Dr and this is how we do it now have you been happy family\nDon't your support for uninterrupted programming donating a dollar a day the W. M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nFor them it's a simple choice either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side\nUh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they're all talking about everything from Medicaid by and medical I mean this candidate up in Michigan or there's a list is like and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders and many other Democrats to say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this is a very active conversation\nThat really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans or lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading into twenty twenty presidential election\nWell since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the health care system that the ... act\nDid not solve that cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott Lilly railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhat they say bringing your costs for families and go down twenty five hundred dollars then almost doubled stockpiles Rob copayments rough\nThey send you wouldn't lose your doctor now we know that was his ally of the century you wouldn't lose your plan we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said it was going to do didn't do it how\nWe have got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott now in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions\nExactly the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional pre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turn quickly now if I Can't do Reid Epstein he's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joins us today from Washington read welcome to on point I make them so I you know to Jonathan and Joe had been telling us a lot about what they're seeing and racism they followed ... ... is a pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail is well\nWell the thing to remember is that like for Democrats running in races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the\nThe most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about the uh I was just in Nevada this weekend a writing about the Senate race there in Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed\nHealthcare and and the preexisting condition argument front and center and her campaign or to the Democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions on health care and it's it's an issue\nThat Democrats clearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen\nBy the way that Republicans have a handle the preexisting condition question uh so many of them are now vowing to protect a the preexisting ... previously protection\nPreexisting condition protections that they have voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties see as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay to wrestle read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... ... we hit on it a little early but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then a similar plan came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the ensuring coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the Affordable CARE Act if I have this right saying that ensures quote may not establish rules for eligibility based on\nHealth status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but Jonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nBy becoming an NRA shooting instructor but

U. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOh or you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something fatherly for me which was buying me my first gun\n... what kind of gun was it like twenty six color day Gluck ... why did you choose that one because I was interested in self defense as much as\nAny other part I marketing ship came later but at that moment you know we're talking about ... we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding what lethal force is we're talking about um\nThe mechanics of self defense shooting of distance of shooting a and we're talking about why some people\nHad been gun buying firearms and a even as far back is twenty seven twenty twelve and what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I Will not having conversations about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles\nYes yeah so what was he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms and twenty tend to an eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people\nFeel that that is their right and and it is right we have laws that say this and people are very very interested and letting everyone else knew\nIf you come over here you might not walk away and that for me is a deterrent\nUh-huh [noise] I I mean I guess one thing I was wondering is I'm a ... just before a un after President Obama was\nFirst elected we saw a a surgeon gun sales did that ever entered the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks ah it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right and this is the state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have what are called\nI'm at the time or academy sports and you can walk in there and and by any real caliber of hand gun ammunition and how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's there's kind of a surplus and people can't really move firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was in office because a lot of people still harbor to fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and try to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of assault rifle this kind of handgun a and those while you know\nFictitious were also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do it does not matter\nIf what you believe isn't what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word\nDon't tell them to their face that they're wrong irritate them and make them mad\nNow make you do for your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out and that's where I was trying to take this conversation or even before you know I I even thought that I might entertain becoming that good with a pistol and I we get stymied mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about\nYeah you know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir where do you talk about ah the day that you got home\nOr or ... or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had had purchased for it you could you read that part of the demand more to us\n[noise] yes ma'am [noise] gotta lotta Oxford comma isn't it [noise] um [noise] the Jamie I got back home with my new gun still in its box set it on my bed and looked at it for some time\nI had an open did at the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud\nWhat I felt was something more like fear like the fear I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the being who was so merciful he drowned the planet cashed out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love\nFear the way I was taught to feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police\nStay out of jail and stay alive I knew that the first time I lost respect for that pistol no larger than mice just it could kill me or getting killed\nI open the box and picked up the clock I was amazed at how intuitive it was a process of removing empty magazine putting it back and wrecking the slide was really that easy a person with a gun tends to feel a lot like Superman with X ray vision laser site and hopes mash strength\nWhich is why telling that person to use those super powers will generally result in the person looking at you like your the

or an R. J. just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association [noise] uh I I'm just what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there was a multi ... there were a bunch of reasons why the association was formed a protection to the the desire for self protection amongst\nAfrican Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about\nA African Americans and gun history in America\nYeah and I got to profile dug for the book and so that was cool I hadn't heard his voice in quite some time spent on tape but that's that's the message messages there is a responsible way to use this there are folks like myself\nWho believe that they should be armed for self defense and there is the historical aspect of\nGuns were taken from people who look like you and that is not something that you get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\n[noise] so I'm just wondering I [noise] I I hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of African Americans maybe there is increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps ... especially in recent years but\nR D did you ever feel like you were actually potentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around a question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was a legal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident speech more to watch the n._r._a. should have done in an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like ... and like dumped Jefferson and the people for which that organization represents but in regard to me\nI'm going to help me man a magnet let me\nLet let me let me break it down a I walked into studio right where I'm a member careless you shut up and I have on a Black Panther sure Scott ... on it because that's what the movie's really about having a Black Panther ...\nWhat kinda stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have a lot better braided up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't gonna be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm dressed and also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not um I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go round is just that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around and just a gun in a room is not bigger than any illicit you can walk in there you're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say\nAnd that's not correct and that's not right but it is true is a fear so in the course of getting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist and I am asking questions and I'm looking at data and I'm looking at it\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of might be point seven W.
