scores and grades even extracurricular activities to some extent\nSystematically penalize black and Latino students um and some subgroups of Asian American students as well\nAnd so I think to sort of look at the admissions process and to look at the personal score as the only one that could be potential Tobias it incorrect\nBecause all of these factors are in perfect all of them to some extent are

for taking my call and high magna I really love your program\nI'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question that fan and a comment is that uh in my career where I live here in New York City I worked in a new show for my career I'm retired now and I see\nThe school system in this city public versus the exceptional schools\nAs apartheid structured and\nThe other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that are African Americans have like a ... a ... four hundred year deficit and\nPursuing a equity in this country and that's reflected in our schools\nAre going to most of the public schools in this\nIn the city of New York or you don't see Asian and white\nCivil how are you in are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then to a level that field to write the historical inequities\n[noise] yes I yes I Do and I think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads in the sand or at Harvard ... less than fifty percent of the student body is is African American\nWell let me take it back to me on on on that point in it and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of uh voices who want to join us like very much appreciate your call I'll let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on almost as far as affirmative action does you know\nI think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean\nYes if it wasn't for affirmative action some things would have never been able to take place\nBut it isn't in the race balancing but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all for the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida and maybe the African American myself I went to someone who is through high school and elementary school or I couldn't believe this woman right there in my community I mean I had to be bused way over here because it wasn't even black students going over there\nAnd my sisters following through the same thing and and during the eighties early seventies but it was that to be very violent and things of that nature\nAnd I mean I don't I don't I don't know the minute it says a double sided coin you know I mean as far as like what the Asian Americans with Harvard I think it has to do with the as far as like some of the personal credit here that need in order to get into the school\nI think that it has to do with the fact ah\nFrom my experience of them a lot of other people and experience so I yeah I Know about the Asian community they're not very in close it up and saw a thing that has something to do with the about the personal effects but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well versed they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those others\nOkay did you get back to be there a mutt thank you so much for your call Nicole gung ho chi let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a\nI mean a a duty was talking about his experience as an African American male or in this

can be broken down and what you heard\nFrom DJ it was probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions with Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an

really the force behind this case what he said it two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race in applications so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian plaintiffs no now Edward Blum has a long history of\nAgain bringing cases against affirmative action to the Supreme Court he also challenged the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder\nOr and and won that case if the Supreme Court of getting a the court to overturn a very key part of the voting rights act he's been focused on race a lot in America but but what I mean Harvard uses a athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why\nWhy should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with\nTheir merits there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against a students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean if you look there's a lot of other issues apart from race that a separate that the haves and the haves and have not in the way Harvard admit admit students\nWell Harvard may be making ... decisions when it comes to the preferences gives for ... for uh people enough low tax but those are decisions so the private university republic one for the murder or fried Meg so\nWhy do they make the decisions

rise and fall of the American department store\nAnd and Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how Sears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country you know was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order for him you know and it's competition was um Montgomery Ward it also had a catalog and the late Nineteen century um but uh uh this was a a wave that's um\nRural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out on your railroad cars you know across the country\nAnd you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard war in the years and\nHell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business that all that has allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these untapped customers in rural parts of the country\nUm I mean I think the ... they started out as\nA selling watches so it was just a sort of limited of from in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board um and he took the company\nInto it sort of a modern day for him as so I I think that this was the gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between the rich and the poor\nAnd but you know it was a time of industrialization\nAnd I'm also movement into cities and the growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also um wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it\nOn other otherwise they would have had to you know travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street an entrepreneur um a sort of\nGoing it's small towns across the country then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nWas Sarah Jose isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets in opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as as Vicky how are just saying you know also in the suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many mold in America\nYeah I think in some ways the story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still Merlin agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns on and making that\nAdaptation so quickly I mean you think about that they didn't start stores so Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores were the majority of their business compared to a to catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes in the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and speed was mentioned even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think here's occupy\nSuch an important place in retailing history in Congress and\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with the seniors are softer years perhaps at least once in their lives so lots of lots of memories

really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted the owner and manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school\nThat I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know and I especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those days about I'm an old style manager here I was\nSixteen years old and I was on the phone with a customer who wanted to order a replacement parts\nFor his Webber grill which was not hard but he was really really difficult and really unhappy and heart to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy what's that his wife had left him and she had um [noise] taking the parts but not the grill uh-huh\nAnd and I and I didn't I couldn't handle it and I finally said to him excuse\nMe sir it's not my fault that your wife left you and I hung up on it and he called the store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never

they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of ... okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it it it actually maybe less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all Congress has done online and certainly I it's it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent in categories like apparel it's probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTo wonder if there's president in apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct and still in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in

and so you're getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterpart I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's are those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nA best buy stock in your all time high is that it as it has staged a remarkable turnaround is taking share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption
