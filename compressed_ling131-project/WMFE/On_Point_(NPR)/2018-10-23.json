M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOr it could take a listen to that our there it was terrific it as an issue we have talked about and will continue to do so in the future but this hour we thought it was actually important to also take a look at election security\nAnd voting security at the state and local level and you know in our defense I'm going to say we're not the only ones who were worried about this because here is a clip of Senator Marco Rubio at a Senate intelligence committee back in March\nLaying out what he thinks could be a hypothetical hacking he'd give me an example of how it can be done on local election system\nThey penetrate the voter database of local election officials in strategically located counties or states\nAnd then they use analytic information they may have gotten from who knows where and they use that information to go into the database and they changed the addresses of individuals there by their precincts move around maybe they even delete some people from the rolls\nAnd the result is that on election day we started getting reports about thousands of voters in different parts of the country who can't vote because when they show up\nThey're not registered they're not in the system or they show up and they're told that they're voting places halfway across town somewhere else\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio there in San ... Senate intelligence committee in March Tim start for me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on um lots of specific examples\nOf challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me the story briefly of the election systems and software machine a model six fifty populating machine and I should note that election systems in software is\nOne of the country's largest vendors and voting equipment\nUm what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate machine\nI've actually brought that up a little bit already but I'll I'll operate because there are some other details about yeah interesting one is so it's a bow tie building machine that could be used at the at the county level to ah if it were ... it could alter hundreds and hundreds of votes perhaps thousands\nThat's part one another part is that it was ... was the one that was able to be broken up with a with a with a writing Pam\nAnd third um it it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security or the voting miners have taken a lot of criticism you know ... one of them\nFor kind of sticking their head and the fans on this I'm not realizing that this is a problem and wanting to kind of go away\nUm other other machines have had other problems um you know strange things like researchers finding a Chinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is a ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing them who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even realize a Chinese music playlist yes\nIt was it was like MP threes if you remember it was a it was a it was an older machine that they that they found this on it also found some examples of people um I it's sending out or or being ... are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tampered with him that way although they had no conclusive evidence and so we have never what\nHave we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on any of the machines are no because we haven't done those forensic artist that you're talking about\nI I think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now we're being from us but but keep in mind of course that now are spent on basically everything you're saying yeah there's a strong chance that that has happened and I'm just not aware of it in a few people are well\nEric Rosen buck Tim points out that\nSome states use these this particular machine the models six fifty to process the ballots for entire counties and you can imagine and closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Bronner University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or to ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found even when they identify flaws is that they don't get sick\nSo it's not a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] those are really important point sort of Europe this was not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty forty the Russian intelligence services attacked the bow tabulation machine in Ukraine decided to sort of try to suppress about election you could see them easily using that same playbook in the U.S\nOn the question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clothes and proprietary based on their bottom line interest of trying to make money\nAnd were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security to find vulnerabilities I'm the one big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSomebody here because the the the level to which some of these uh these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as Kim starches is reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference\nThat er ES and asked election systems in software actually I Believe scent of a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary have copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nYeah it's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether\nI don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced starts formation it reminds me a little bit of back in the older days when the music industry was so adamantly protecting things in a way that didn't allow new technology to emerge\nUm so I think there's a problem there now states or in a position where they unfortunately are under resourced and so don't always have a lot of money to update the systems and keep their security up to date or do patching\nSo there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this was more on the vendors not being as transparent as they should\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania deputy deputy secretary for elections and administration posts she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to um point huh thank you\nUh first of all let's let's get your take on this um E. S. S. example again election uh election system to software the major vendor of voting machines and in this country because they have issued a statement saying that this report about the hack ability of their machines\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from college fine where consulting work with high school students to identifying achieved their goals in high school and\nComplete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship award more in college ... dot com\nAnd exact science is offering coal a guard for average risk adults over Fifteen a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home by prescription only information that coal to guard test dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making ... we're talking about election integrity at the state and local level about how to be sure the vote you actually cast a ballot you kept it as secure\nAs possible and I'm speaking this hour has Tim's Stark's he covers cyber security for political ... Rosen Bach also joined us he's co director of Harvard spell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project Mary Schneider is with us as well she's president of verified voting national in Texas the election integrity\nAdvocacy group and let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Condos that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that'd be who you are\nThat is indeed who I Am\nWell Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in a how was that the state of elections security in Vermont\nSo we said we feel that will shape we uh we actually started working on cybersecurity electrical systems package thousand thirty\nA ... at that time we did it all blown risk and ball ability assess but um we had any recommendations or a potent you eat in a low priority or at least\nConsistently work to get all those recommendations are that are being said that we also do\nA better tasting test and we continue to do a a regular up or the patient says well uh I think that the important thing to remember most\nOf most of your listeners is that uh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very just east central islip the amount of like Boston New England we don't have county government level to the state level or in\nAnd you know we've got a lot of things going on and I sat on a panel Eric Wilson bomb it back in the march of ... or the Senate committee a you know we announce it that on to your implementing on occasion yeah we go with one of application fire walls so to eat\nWell we'll secretary I think she kind of somebody just jump in here your cell phones are also a bit shaky here but it does it to the key question when I ask you before hopefully your luck out fully like whoa fall apart but\nI'm seeing here that even given the steps that you you said you've just taken Vermont to ensure the security of the voting system there\nAs much as possible I mean NBC News is real reports that in August in late August there were three different methods used to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups tried\nTo get access to your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did in Libya but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the oil that has a website or anything that isn't getting an everyday what we experienced was scans are a lot a lot a lot of systems showed us\nWhere they were coming originating from although you can always count on that but the one that we used our attention if you want to call it\nUm was one of the Russian Federation voted on to a department of homeland security through the communication calls that we have a developed over the last year\nAnd I think that you know our systems are getting paid thousands of times per day thousands times per hour the question is how you put the systems in place to defend against it back in two thousand sixteen were forty one state that were targeted yep one state was reached\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOrlando Health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations who served central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids I I haven't I haven't\nHeard of that which state which was breached secretary condos\nThought it was I Believe it was a leader was a um Illinois\nOkay interesting well one last question for you briefly because I Want to turn back to I guess with the with what you have to say but but I mean you're the ... state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in elections security\nWell now let me let me speak for myself and I was a ... he was that there are some this practice that we need to always\nOne of them even though it was really the only way that you actually audit oh we do we do our confidence level audit randomly select owns after thirty days election\n[noise] doing them ... thousands of discrepancy\nYeah well Jim Condos secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call\nYour walk\nA Mary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what the secretary of state of Vermont had to say\nWell I think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that was said earlier in the show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis of machines or\nAnything like that theory a statistical sample of these ballot of the voter my paper ballots that you can check and make sure the software um was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing a risk of vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor to do the same thing and I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes\nThe elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes around in a very small secretary of State Department so the level of resources is going to vary widely ... I think we keep coming back to this resource\nQuestion well let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHigh make now I Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machine we switch to voter Mart ballot\nCombined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning we had locked suitcases for each district we have a [noise]\nStickers that keep the voting machine from a messed with unless\nSomebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by\nA board of elections on those uh audits shape how many ballots they ... they come shrink wrapped in a package is the fifth day we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots are people that aren't showing up in our um\nOur in our election bucks so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the at the gate and ballot and\nHave a chance to vote when they voted against gun marking the ballot they have little circles and then for each candidate and um and that yeah they take the paper ballot they get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through at the end of the night\nWe have people who break down the voting machine they a scanner and we have\nSet aside the idea of being left behind in fact she doubts situations that reconfirmed\nThe jeopardy I created let the church say man\nBut ... says it was dragged that finally saying free that's coming up next our ongoing\nI'm Joshua Johnson the host of one day become a sustaining member of W.

I'm surprised that more of the queen's just don't have a nervous breakdown on the on every episode\nBut with each passing season we've also seen a lot more of their personal stories as well and I just wanted to play a little bit of a montage of three moments where we learned some very incredible things are about some of these drag queens I sit here are those moments\nThey got me exercise because they thought I was ...\nI was so confused after the whole thing went down because [noise] was straight now [noise]\nI just wanted to say and I was ...

M. F. U. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nAnd them as the show become mainstream\nWell those are two big questions after the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because\nUh in our ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is\nI'm a ... will never take cold because the ego will not accept\nThe idea of someone changing their identity we're our whole\nCulture is based on a density a consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is and drag is the opposite of that drag says who now I'm this didn't oh now and not\nSo drag will never be mainstream uh now um [noise] you know racial issues it's it's um with within the dragon what ... what happens is\nUm we get a lot of young people who have ideas of of of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas\nUm I I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with um the fact that a lot of young people\nThey gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show\nWill have way more a social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind\nSo that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this Earth I'm a ... it has very little to do with\nOur show because our show I Believe we ... our show is the most diverse or a cast in television we have we cast everybody in fact I think uh uh this past season without giving anything away well\nYeah because I was going to get a good little T say who we have on the show um\nUh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much [laughter] you have your token white folks with a wave that so when I'm listening you know we\nWe cast the show based on the criteria is one is charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast the show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking this question but I just have to know ah [laughter] I'm a huge ... fan and and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that\nThat that you you track her from the showing that in that great lip sync between her and took the metallic\nAnd I I don't think she was ... what happened there well\nWe we uh first of all you need in so Rob because share Angela is almost steals the ... the movie stars born she's in that movie and she does a great job in that but the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner\nOr even as you played the the the clip of misfit Angie she did one episode and became an in tuned she full time [laughter] so you know um nobody loses if if you're on the show you're a winner\nOkay so that actually leads me to say something else that I wanted to ask you about because um there's been a lot of media coverage of recalls drag race because it has become so popular and it has really uh elevated the careers\nYou know of the drag queen to appear on the show to super stardom level as you said but I think it was in a big New York times article a while ago", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "23"}
