this all important teenage years later health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nInheriting the money from his father and then treating the IRS I Know it's it's a huge shock to all of us\nWell you say that but he sold a ton of books he says a lot of TV shows and whatever yeah we are so resented dismissing built this thing on the idea that he's a self made guy here\nHe is absolutely not he inherited I think something like four hundred million dollars from his father in today's dollars uh if you had put that into the S. and P. five hundred you know he would have already been a billionaire without having to do anything on a lake of work\nHe is an incredible self self promoter I Will give him that that is absolutely true but if you look at the contents of this monster ... day you see that again and again this guy who supposedly has a nice touch 'em\nYou know and make made huge business errors and had to be bailed out by his daddy this happened repeatedly that's happened with his casinos in his happened with other businesses so this idea that he has some sort of um\nYou know special insight into how to run a business or or how to cut a deal I Believe he is charming I Believe and you know and and I I Believe he is probably an effective\nDealmaker in the sense that he can bully people into getting what he wants but the idea that he is self made is just bogus\nJust bogus well let's play a little bit of a what his press secretary Sarah Sanders had to say during a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday a you know the report had accused the president of questionable tax schemes and as you say Dodgers threw out here's what she had to\nTotally false attacks based on an old recycled news story I'm not going to sit and go through every single line of a very boring fourteen thousand word story the only thing I Will say one thing the article did get right was it showed that the president's father actually had\nA great deal of confidence in him in fact the president brought his father into a lot of deals they made a lot of money together so much so that his father went on to say that everything he touches turns to gold\nEverything he touched turned a goal jak beauty when you read that story it fit confirmed things that you already believe a or not or what news do you take from from having read that that peace\nWill trust the dimension of his a bogus self presentation you\nKnow he was he was a gilded diaper would deal to die for your red diaper babies there was a gilded started for baby and you know the one phrase that sticks out as self made sham or just the degree of this and then with the points of transferred mood\nA email questions of legalities which seemed to be there an outright fraud which some of them and so\nIt's just the the his his upward failures you know where you were just keep failing ... plaza hotel botched Trump or a large bust casinos fail or in other words displaying in finance and business the bad judgment about economic matters that we see is president\nAnd a and an end and David Farenthold\nWho is really the French fries on his taxes and so low points out that just when daddy's um you know contributions were\nFading out two thousand three two thousand for income the Russian oligarchs to fill the vacuum of daddy and and you know the the two people you'll never say anything against her daddy I'm Glad to be a ...\nA Jackie can sense when you think about this story or one of the things that strikes me is that part of my fascination is is that the president didn't release his tax returns has been done nominees both presidential parties for the last I think forty years\nWhat repercussions if any other likely to be on the hill from what we've learned at least is this significant glimpse behind the curtain\nWell yes and your abs and one of the biggest takeaway from the story and this was on this point has been made but that it just gives us the best picture of Donald Trump's financial situation I'm In the past that we've had yet we don't have anything recent now speaking of recent it really a lot of this depends on who wins the MIT terms\nBecause Democrats say both I'm Richard Neal and Senator Ron Wyden they will be the top of their respective committees and the house in the Senate that could request\nHis tax returns and both of them came out right away and said that's what we're going to do we're going to get him out rather to go if the Democrats take over if they try now they're going to be told though right\nLet's turn now to something that Trump's or the president gets to Harold as big good news ah he's just a his administration has just been able to strike\nOr a new version of NAFTA or as he puts it to a brand new deal a with our neighbors to the north of Canada are neighbors the south in Mexico for this trade deal a on Monday Trump addressed how's rocky relationship with Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau might've affected his ability to complete the deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada\nWe had very strong tensions if it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal to renew do not NAFTA returned it to a brand new deal\nJustin Trudeau had his own thoughts during his press conference a speaking about the trade pact and hero the deal is a victory for all three countries as things North American trade would be in a much more stable place\nThat would have to preserve the fundamental principle of the original agreement which is that when you're trading partners ten times your size\nYou need rules you need a level playing field\n... is this a brand new deal you know so why not\nThere is some stuff in there that is slightly more protectionist there's some stuff in there that it's slightly more trade liberalizing but for the most part this deal looks a lot like the whole deal in fact it's kind of two deals to trade deals that Trump has previously called the worst trade deal ever\nSmash together that is NAFTA and the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP which\nObama had negotiated with a lab and other countries and Trump immediately pulled us out of as soon as he became president but yeah I mean it's funny we spent basically to last year and a half\nAlienating our friends and allies punishing farmers and manufacturers with rounds of terrorists and counter terrorists\nAnd busting apart and is a hard fought alliance that we had to try to alienate China and ended up basically in the same place we would have been had we not done any of those things and just\nProceeded with TV and more ...\nDealt with Canada and Mexico who were by the way quite willing to to update NAFTA or they themselves had said many times are both as part of the TPP negotiations and and otherwise\nThat NAFTA was old and needed some modernization you know it didn't it didn't include like e commerce and a bunch of things that didn't exist in the early nineties so we're basically where we would have been um had Trump not brought all of this damage and destruction\nSo I don't exactly know what the pay office I'm given that we have this long term damage to our relationships with our allies should\nPressure dealer feet

Folkenflik and we're talking about the week in the news with Jackie could send it to the Daily Beast Catherine Rampell washing posting on point use analyst Jack Beatty you can join the conversation what other stories or on your radar this week we're at one hundred forty three to five five\nBut one hundred forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook that on point radio\nI think one of the interesting questions that we have is how all these things play out one of the midterms are going to look like they're just a few weeks away ... you talked to people on the hill what what forces did they say we're going to be shaping the selection\nWill shouldn't really interesting the last a day or two um you started to hear some nervousness from Democrats I'm On the hill and elsewhere about how this Cavanaugh a confirmation was playing out initially because of all the allegations that were\nComing forward I'm from I women and his past\nThere was a thought that a vote for Kavanaugh would cause a backlash among women I'm with a Republican that said as the as this has gone on and that so much more it's come out there is a feeling I'm within Republicans and I don't care where what part of the party are talking about at this point\nThat he's been under attack that this has been unfair and started to shift against and it started to your ear starting deceived talking to Republicans in their internal polling you're starting to see the Republican base wake up\nAnd really get back to get engaged and to get involved which is exactly what Democrats do not want so yesterday you were hearing from Democrats okay let's just get this over with so we can go on and start you know go back on the campaign trail and refocus\nOr people on other issues now will that momentum from the cabinet vote should he be confirmed today we do not know that had a I'm Sorry tomorrow um we didn't know they get but ... but if if he is confirmed will the anger on the right to be able to sustain itself for five weeks\nI have a hard time believing that just because of how fast the news cycle tends to go ...\nYou know we talked about the legacy of Anita Hill Clarence Thomas in his uh sharing she of course has been on the bench ever since uh is it your sense that things have changed in any way as a result of these terms in terms of the conversation about uh about allegations of sexual assault and the way in which they're handled\nI think before the hearings I Would have said that yes we take these kinds of accusations much more seriously today in the wake of me too and the wake of greater awareness of the prevalence of um problems like sexual harassment and sexual assault\nYou mean as a result of the party won ... hardly yeah Roger ... yes so many a major figures who has been accused of a various kinds of\nA sexual misconduct and have had a fall from grace as a result and I would add you plenty of other you know Bill Cosby amongst others you know people who are like blood figures are very powerful figures out daily yes exactly um who have been punished to some extent for their behavior\nThat said the way that these hearings 'em and accusations related to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have shaped up um suggests somewhat of a different lesson which is that it's not so much that I'm\nA people on the left has become more fired up they were already fired up about issues related to meet you in sexual misconduct instead you have people on the right more fired up if you had asked me a month ago whether I thought that having a Supreme Court nominee at a Trump nominated a Supreme Court pick\nA credibly accused of sexual assault whether that would be good for Republicans I Would have said no that that is clearly not the lesson that we have seen we had seen that the the right as Jackie mentioned has become much ...\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're committed

were talking about earlier about the economy [noise]\nI I I don't know I suggest he probably was right about the dynamics that you know the Republicans going to have left to be indignant about the ...

character didn't matter to Republicans\nA group of political scientists who study the president's paddle\nA couple of hundred of them uh last year said the president was already the worst president is in America's history well we can't do that but he's certainly among the most of the worst characters who've been president who's lying all the stuff with women and so on but that\nDoesn't matter to Republicans now do you mean we can voters or demean folks in the party checked\nI I I mean I mean I'm In Republican voters they essentially made that just that's where the Clinton campaign was all

how how the tide turns um I think any district where he and I think Texas is going to be very interesting not necessarily because of the Senate race there but because of that you're seeing record on voter registration and Texas\nAnd you're seeing in the house seats where perhaps the turn out that a barrel work\nIs um generating might end up toppling some of these Republicans who have been there

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nSo I mean it it gets a little crazier from there but I mean it it it um [noise] I certainly thought when I heard the idea for the show that someone somewhere with ... because that doesn't seem like a sitcom to me\nNo I mean it seems it seems like the setup for an extremely tough tough drama that you know you could imagine HBO tree you know the guys who did the wire during this very differently absolutely\nAnd yet it at a rubber car like and Tina Fey made it into a an extremely funny show\n[laughter] so tell me about that because what you you know it's it's a it's a the SATs did your outfits like everything is incredibly brave almost passed All right yeah and you could not be ... you know you as you mentioned earlier of a temper as ... character yet but you could not be basically a more default sunny earlier\nI Love that about ... because she is sort of unabashedly girlish she wears bright pink pastel pants much you might like LA's chagrin because I don't I don't like to think that\nBut she were frightening that's short floral shirts you were jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and yet at the same time she is this fierce\nTenacious warrior who has been through something to think of all and\nI'm so difficult that I Can't actually imagine what that must have been like and yet he continues to choose to think the best in people and that it's mysterious to me I don't know if you're born with that\nSort of tenacity or or if you have a force to develop it during you know at a test like the one she was put through but um I think it's I think it's remarkable and and she's such she's an admirable beyond admirable person\nAlso very childish yeah ah you know in the way she deals with people in season one of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are ... and friend Titus a tries to give her a goodbye hug on the first day of school staff\nMembers of your tires are uneducated it'll find\nOut some day when you're a black man you have accumulated you see like\nThis [noise]\n[laughter]\nTruly truly funny a and you know in Deering and loving every time there's an undercurrent of bleak it in all this stuff how do you how do you look at this rather dark comedy with such cheerful is\nI I don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject as as a very serious as the one\nUm that can meet the the the torture that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because bad stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it is in the writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think if it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just [noise]\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know that fine and sunny one moment and then horrible and a kind of ... the next and and you have to navigate those times so that it was that I went abroad and so I'm like well it reflects life but it does\nWell so you just obviously show created by Tina Fey was done initially for NBC and leave it was either a Robert Greenwald who's the head of entertainment I guess he was like this is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful let's sell this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about this and\nI Do and I I thankfully don't know the conversations that took place so I I get to plead ignorance but um yes it was originally slated to be on NBC and again it you know I I think it\nSpeaks to the discomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl was went underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus was sending her off school can she didn't get to complete high school when there's something very adolescent or immature about her I mean what where would you be if you'd been held up until ... twelve or something\nYou know I'm alarmed that because sometimes when McKinney doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people in two thousand Eighteen to have I'm like oh I didn't know that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not ... not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I have gone on Instagram before you honestly I place where she's [laughter] I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think that she is necessarily naive because about certain things because she has been her her adolescence stunted it's Arrested Development and she's coming out\nUm as a [noise] twenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life no but yeah I think you are but she is she's you know\nI she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nIn a lot of ways you guys sort of\n... I I wouldn't say that you had on address but you certainly come into contact with a lot of issues that people are are working through in thinking about\nA there are a couple of episodes something about in particular here's a clip from season for of unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and you can hear it can be arguing with friends he's the leader of a men's rights group called the Innocence Project [laughter] way by Bobby ...\nFemales have it's so easy for me please flick I'll come when your body makes milk it's beautiful\nWell oh woman I can tell you it's easy breezy beautiful cover girl\n\nShe was sort of trickery capital I've been a junior salesman uh Darryl bridal for Fifteen Years I've seen with females truly are all you care about the ring and address and not what\nI mean we'll go with me because the women who come in here are engaged\nOn their mom has been making a point he's making a very good point or another episode of\nCoworkers accuse your character a of sexual harassment Kimmy Schmidt sexual harassment in the workplace in this scene you'll hear can be attempting to soften the blow of firing an employee named ... here she touches his shoulders and then I could you not she dropped ... in an attempt to demonstrate her own humiliation in the moments like\nYou to be here I'd like to see new every day\nBut maybe weren't isn't the best place for that maybe our friendship belong in the night you get what I'm trying to say\nLet's take a look at the weather for the rest of the weekend we do have some beautiful weather ahead starting tonight\nI mostly clear night with a low around Seventy three gotta love those fall temperatures and tomorrow Saturday only about a twenty percent chance of showers otherwise uh mostly sunny day with a high near Ninety and a low around Seventy three checkout W.

I Would no I I think it's too\nCrazy time to avoid that we played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids itself was\nReally funny at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... uh apparently you said you shared a questions about women in comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch weight text talk twenty fourteen you took on the question that you said that you've been out not just by ... by reporters and the question was are women funny\nAre funny yes some women are funny\nAren't funny I [noise] it's it's similar to how some women are tall [noise]\nAnd you know sell him in our short it's like how they like to ride the train well others prefer to take the we are different [laughter]\nThey are but apparently the women are different from one another's what you're saying as well as from from the\nRight I think that women are different from one ... in that in that I accept I Am talking about women are all sorts of different ones and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\n[noise] so but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know a meta question from reporters that goes on these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions right hopefully some of them was muted than others\nBut I I think that if someone bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know for reporters have a conference of what happens but\nEveryone decided like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women and I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay ... are so women can be funny but I have ... being honest\nAnd I never had a thought that women weren't funny I ... I think it was based on the box office success and bridesmaids that that a demonstrated studios that you\nCan make a very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny is so stupid because it what are you talking about yeah they've always been fun\nWhen you went after a delay Christopher Hitchens who I you know the noted British an intentional controversial as he actually wrote this thing for vanity fair's ... obviously women are not funding they don't need to be a was that something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in the two thousands would that's still a thing\nI never encountered that and I know some women have an ... in improv I think and I said it did a less of it are citizens brigade theater and the people's improv theater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from\nWhen I have encountered it it's from um [noise] listen\nIt's from white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from uh some people I went to college with who who work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed that the movie was funny\nAnd I thought get out of my inbox because what's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised me furious because but I I you know it but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think which is that there's it's not an issue that someone is in a sketch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funnier they're Nazis", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "06"}
