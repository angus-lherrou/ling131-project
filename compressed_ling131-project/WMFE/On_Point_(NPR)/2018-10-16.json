[noise] I'm\nEditing or his you know Steve we're just starting out before it gets you a question because I Do I Do want to hear your question but since you said you went to the Richmond, Kentucky rally or with the president\nThis weekend um and he said it was wonderful I'm just wondering when the president says things that are demonstrably untrue um you know when he basically says the Democrats want open borders to flood the country with criminals you heard that that clip earlier her ... they don't know I don't think any Democrat who they advocated open borders to flood the country with criminal\nOh yes for half a half you're totally wrong\nTo flood the country with to to lead the country with criminals\nYeah that's correct and my Thirteen out of control\nYes but well I guess what I'm Wondering a Steve is that that the president's asserting that the Democrats won commercials that come into the country no Democrat has ever said that so I'm just wondering when he says things that are that are untrue does that does that trouble you at all\nNot true because it perhaps for correct\nOkay uh and so then you're the question that your your your your sadly wrong\nOr I don't think I've heard a single Democrat say they want to welcome criminals into the country but but you a quick question that you that you had for for for a panel\nKind of a moot point really um you know the question I heard was do you think that a President Trump will\nGo easy one day and somebody from in front of the bill one or think she'll go outside to go on for a report from around [noise]\nOkay well Steve thank you so much for your call a necessarily been David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a lot of questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense there okay what do we know\nWhile I was raised because during the sixty minutes interview the president said something about mad as being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to praise and it probably was suggesting that had a mad as has somewhat more [noise]\nYou know perhaps dovish views for lack of a better term and the president doesn't certain things in that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nUh Madison was going to stay that long after the midterms in midterms are traditionally time when a lot of cabinet members may leave and perhaps Mattis is on that list um I think it's a little early to know where he would go for replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former lawmaker but there is some precedent for going to the corporate world\nI think it's early to say but I think uh it was the first time at least that I knew that if there had been that clear of a signal from the White House that the possibility that Madison might not be around for that much longer or was in the air\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had to ask the caller about ... what he thought of\nWhen the president says things that are are untrue and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at these rallies that the president does say things that that we can prove that have no\nUh no no evidence behind them and I mean I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have on potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response to that\nFor people at those rallies and and I've been to a few ... I was at a rally in Iowa at last week I think our time runs together with a with a with a President Trump but the people at these rallies at they were so energized they\nWere ... they are you know they are true believers\nSo I I don't know whether they take everything that Trump says that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes but they they are his fans regardless he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people\nOutside and that that that clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they're they're not thousands of people outside but he says these things\nBut I don't know that at this point whether it makes much of a difference to the people that support him that like him are that are entertained by the things that he said and that that's the core things that he says resonates with them for a swing voters\nIf you are skeptical of President Trump then these things being point pointed out or make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kind of have to start from a place of if you already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith that that same question to you as as Asia is that it seems as if it's the the swing voters who could be a influence or or push either way of based on what the president says things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nIf anybody can find the swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody's so dug in on both sides\nBut I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture\nTake some of the things that Trump says when he's being a little tongue in cheek we send it sometimes take it too seriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea\nOr no he doesn't literally St Elizabeth Warren has Pocahontas but there are things that are that the the crowds and they are just enormous crowds or don't quite take literally like we do now that's\nWhat I had our caller who said that everything the president said was true and yeah and push back on me several times\nAnd if he can my emails a Smith a Tampa Bay dot com if he can email me the name of a single Democrat that said he wants to open borders more criminals can come in you know I Will have to eat my reporter's notebook [laughter] barbecue and I ... I mean just to jump in and yeah go ahead and that's how I\nMean it may be that he wasn't saying that Democrats are declaring that they're in favor of criminals coming in essence at the impact of everything that they want to do I mean that's sort of how I took what he was trying to say but to me the color you are really exemplified to the extent to which were in this country in a very much an us versus them situation\nAnd the people who are motivated seems to me uh\nAs much or more by hatred sometimes of the other side as belief in their own side it's one reason I think that as we approach the election uh there's more energy from the Republicans because the prospect of democratic takeover pointing to people like\n...\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from W.

NPR's White House correspondent Adam Smith is also with us he's political editor for the Tampa Bay times and the Taliban David joins us as well he's an editor at the wall Street Journal the Washington bureau and\nAnd we've got lots of comment coming in here's one from our website or on point radio dot org DX OSHA says the fact that Florida keeps being hit the storm should make them start to think twice about politicians like governor Rick Scott\nWho denied climate change and\nSince we're just talking about storms and climate change we should play this moment from President Trump's interview with Leslie stall on sixty minutes\nA lovely still open with hurricane Michael it asked the president if he still thinks climate change is a hoax now the president didn't necessarily a he said he didn't necessarily trust scientists because he believes scientists have a political agenda uh and then he said this\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nAyesha Rascoe let me just turn to you quickly on that I mean the scientific consensus is overwhelming that our current at the climate change that we're seeing is indeed a human driven or human exacerbated ... just your thoughts on hearing that clip from the president\nIt was interesting because when the when the White House and and when President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year\nThere were a lot of questions from reporters are constantly you know asking uh the the White House does President Trump still believe that climate change is a hoax and they kind of refused to answer and at that time\nPresident Trump wasn't giving interviews like he's giving now so this is like the first time that he was really pressed on climate change since he became president\nAnd he basically repeating even though he's not he said it's not a hoax he's still repeating this idea that he doesn't really believe it or he doesn't think that it's really an issue\n... well uh I should note that the president tweeted today that he's going to Florida in Georgia with the first lady to tour hurricane damage and visit with FEMA first responders and law enforcement or so to that point let's go to a color here Beth is calling from St Petersburg Florida you're on the air Beth\nHi uh I'm just curious I Love your Adam perspective on the impact that politics will play on recovery of hurricane Michael because here you have Trump\nComing and um and he sort of control the purse strings Trump and Scott the Republican versus Gillum the Democrat and happened in his backyard pretty much so I'd love to hear on\nThe best thank you for your call Adam go ahead\nWell if I'm One of the people in those are hard hit communities in North Florida I'm actually should be pretty happy that this that everything is so political and we're just a few weeks away from the election because lord knows Rick Scott and Donald Trump or going to do everything they can to look like they are effectively responding to this thing\nUh that said you know you've got some candidates Andrew Gillum a is basically sort of shut down his overt campaigning so he can stay in a\n... in Tallahassee and look like he's involved you've got candidates like Ron ... the fellow who's running for governor who is struggling to get attention and to some extent Bill Nelson our senior senator who whom Rick Scott is running against\nIs also I think having a little bit of a hard time getting notice so politics never disappears uh but that said I I think it's a it's a very very big motivator to respond properly\nYeah well let's switch gears here than and talk about uh the ...\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations that served central Florida family more information including locations Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nShow gave me the Taliban David or the president's tweeting today that he just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia and the king denies any knowledge whatsoever of whatever may have happened\nTo show the a and that now the president President Donald Trump saying he immediately sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to meet with the Saudi king your thoughts on that\nWell it's a bit of a mixed message coming out of the White House and whether that's by design or simply because that's how they are as a little bit hard to say uh it's true he did say that about Saudi Arabia reminded me a little bit of some of his comments about a\nPresident Clinton you know he says that ah they denied very strongly he said it could be some rogue actors uh in in the case of the Russians you may recall he said it could be some four hundred pound guy on the bad I don't need a lot of other yeah in a base and you know I don't think a lot of other people suggesting that could be route killers unconnected to\nSaudi Arabia um so the one hand and the sixty minutes interview he talked about that there's going to be severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis are behind it on the other hand he's taken the idea of canceling our arms deals with Saudis off he he he's just\nTaking that off the table a and his ... talked about how much he he has a good relationship with them but then he turns around and sends palm patio and talks about getting to the bottom of it and it just I think in some ways a reflection of our fairly complex relationship\nWith Saudi Arabia where they're an authoritarian country without any question on the other hand we have a lot of commercials relate relations with them we sort of counting them to be a stabilizing force\nIn the middle east and the one last thing I just want to say is is President Trump tends to have kind of a personal relationship with leaders that's how he described how he'll say whether he means it literally or not that he and Kim fell in love with each other or he and president Xi have\nChemistry it's for him a lot about how he feels his personal relationships are with these folks and it's clear that the leader of Saudi Arabia and I'm Howard been something you know ... people call him\nYou know had a very strong effect not only on a leaders in Washington but also let's face it on many journalists he's a charismatic guy and all these things are complicating factors in\nAs well uh enough highly since you mentioned that moment in the sixty minutes interview let's hear it ah this was when the president told\nLeslie stall that he would be quote very upset and angry if the Saudi Government a day to day to assassinate ... but then as now Taliban David points out President Trump also said he didn't want to lose big arms contracts\nThey ordering military weapon everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wanted it we wanted it we got it so would you cut that off ... well ... what I don't want to do\nRowing blockade Raphael and all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a\nPolitician to use the word that's a pretty harsh words that is true\nThat the president speaking to us who stole a sixty minutes this weekend at let's go to Jose who's calling from Aspen, Colorado has hey you're on the air\nOh pretty good amount of shirt or go to a question or comment [noise] ah\nOh first of all are a lot of people are familiar with is\nA question I'm only a predicament desert for for ... ... just four and a border military after\n... measured approach to the\n... well I Hope they we just heard that clip of the president on sixty minutes saying he doesn't want to do anything to damage those contracts and that there are other ways of quote punishing a the Saudis iffy deems that necessary so perhaps not\nYou know wondering what your journal is okay for a great well let me turn to Ayesha Rascoe for her thought ice or do you think\nThese these military contracts with Saudi Arabia to point out that a lot of these are kind of like promises are like intent like kind of\nLetters of interests are intent so all of the money that he's talking about it's not fully locked in so it it's really um I ... I don't want to overstate the amount of of actual military contracts that the U.S has with Saudi Arabia\nLaw says it's time for a more restrained approach and we'll hear him out that's coming up next our on point\nSupport the news that matters with your own going monthly gift from your checking account or credit card and we'll send you a pair of Ninety point seven W.

Bush spelled out his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nSo it is a policy of the United states\nDo seeking support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world [noise]\nSo even to a\nDifferent people from two different parties here a spouse ... roughly the same idea but you call this policy failure right why well\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adult had including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations to their central Florida family more information including locations that are laying down health dot com slash kids\nIs on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China a democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nOr the Oslo peace process is underway ah so we were thinking that maybe we're going to get you know peace in the middle east as well as just ... ordinary optimism\nAdair now fast forward to twenty Eighteen\nUm the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believed the two state solution that the United states has actively promoted\nIs farther away than ever Iran had added a as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before fight signing the nuclear deal but they're essentially a a late nuclear power an oh India Pakistan and North Korea has tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat\nIn lots of different places of Freedom House are reported last year that it was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal right to end tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point of the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the cost we've seen in a variety of different places\nWithout a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy of ... worldwide is it that it can be see that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places uh Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in hungry backsliding in Poland or suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transforming the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed a you had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS\nUm the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi led to a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better [noise]\nAnd by the way from all of this is going on then countries like Russia and China\nIn Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nOr one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop as Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable one in terms of its ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nSo one of the questions that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U.S project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the ... said America had to the world being this guiding light for democracy ah but you said that there's an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nA that idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking\nA it's a a broad a group who set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security adviser referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially what I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy the defense department intelligence services State Department so they're part of this\nOf this for a whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that right to comment on foreign issues on a pretty much daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and off and go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about\nUm and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the birth of Gemini this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals and there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three um you see that in the fact that people can circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotations you've been a plane here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals but\n\nYou're listening to Ninety point seven ... and now the needs\nThat evening I'm Nicole dark and crashed in taking a look at your forecast mostly

his new book is the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy\nA and professor wealth lots of comments coming and let me just read a couple of them to you on Twitter pole moves or us is saying questioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\nI says Noam Chomsky debunked this and walk should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion if the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera had been used as a stalking horse for American corporate had Gemini which is highly questionable democratizing influence uh just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all the malt\nI'm I'm sort of sympathetic to both combat it's I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very careful are heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states has favor to ah you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually\nDon't benefit corporations at all if you go back to the uh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton in oil services corporation to do business with Iraq were to do business with Iran\nCheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning both of\nThem and then that very same person ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts there\nThat's right yeah I'm a then finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things things like that\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a dad who's ... has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in Benghazi and the desire to end now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger\nYeah but so I'm just a follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think if the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think taxing organizations who are not surprising these and want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make their money [noise]\nAlright well lots of callers let's get a couple of them in here Mitch is calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nI think so much for taking my call 'em\nYou know I I just think a under under current president um who is an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with a well I worry that are American values\nAre going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh be a journalist a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nMitch thank you for your call even water\nWell in some respects I think uh our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a offensive trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and wanted to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well whether a national security or others\nAnd we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to wind out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a Saudi journalist can show you a in Istanbul and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it\nPresident Trump has been waffling it seems to me on this one uh that his initial statements were were quite forgiving he seems to be in typical Trump being fashion\nKicking up a sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it um it's I think you know the the concern the caller is exactly right here and that I think one of the larger issues with presidents\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAdministration now because the you open your book saying that um ... then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of\nHis view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just remind folks what what the president the then candidate Trump said when he critiqued the status quo of U.S foreign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the cold or a foreign policy veered badly oh of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nLogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance what'd you lead to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April two thousand sixteen now Stephen what we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions of president has made since then I mean about the Paris climate accord about or his or just discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton\nTalking about a standing the American mission in Syria beyond the Syrian civil war and to\nContainment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region a so here's the national security visor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran or at a group called a United against nuclear on summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed the hell to pay\nThe John Bolton there are Stephen Walt not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is that is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour\nUm I think in the twenty six the campaign Trump who's not a sophisticated thinker on these things but he did in to it or that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lot of people out of their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could out or tried to tell her foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is a ... ah since Trump became president although his style his approach to the presidency and has\nA public style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive\nWhat strikes me most about it is how he has been pulled back in a lot of these same directions I'm certainly uh the fact that ah having complained about nation building and we're not going to we're going to get out of the nation building business\nYou know he sent more troops to Afghanistan or as you recounted he now seems to be willing to commit the United states to stay in Syria a much longer even though we don't really have an idea of what we're trying to accommodate potentially indefinitely sexually indefinitely I'm", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "16"}
