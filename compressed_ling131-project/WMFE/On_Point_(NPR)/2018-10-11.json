relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey work hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states joined the value of the United nations secretary general's forward to continuing to work with invested or Haley until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James Stavridis he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive melt the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf teams to read is welcome back to that point\nGreat to be back with you ... how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines first excesses of the un in part by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreement but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying but there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI I find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said\nShe maintained her independence she struck out on a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable or in vast her for the United states however um I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated\nA I don't think contempt is too strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surrounded and the international constellation\nSo she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that we're very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties and denigrating international organizations\nOkay well so tell me more about that I mean if you have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of apple find the language of the Trump Administration ... after you and what are some of those moments that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to\n'em I'd start with the\nUh on the negative side to withdraw from the climate agreement I think\nThat will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration kind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her\nParticular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on a Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons\nOn calling out run on its\nAssassination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done\nAbsolutely and I think that in every sent her departure a is a win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and ... in particular\nSo Colum Lynch respond to that I mean this is one question that I had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration one of the most challenging jobs there isn't the administration because of exactly what\nI Am most readers has said there that are you working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in ... if some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI I think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that it's\nHaley did a very good job of trying to sort of um\nYou know tamped down his most sort of anti you and you know destructive kind of tendencies and was able to kind of bring him along explained to him what the un un was doing trying to bring Jared and evolved on board to sort of recognize the benefits of working\nUm you know through the multilateral system but you know who she is very much in her remarks that you just played\nA very much and bracing the White House America First I'm sort of doctrine she has been you know and she has been a kind of lead agent and the administration to push for an end to foreign aid for countries that are not you know close friends of the United states I'm\nAnd she has been you know very very tough on a number of other issues I mean I think it'd be you and\nShe does have a lot of um achievements that she can point to um she didn't ... job and leading the negotiations on I'm sort of expanding sanctions against North Korea or she has been quite active when some African issues that to others and the administration has shown very little interest in Central African republic the\nUm South Sudan um other search humanitarian issues but it's been sort of it's sometimes hard to see you know in one sense she has sort of um embrace this kind of brand of being kind of a\nA humanitarian after and I are promoter of human rights within the administration but then that sort of conflicts with her kind of positions on um you know dealing for instance with the Palestinians where she's been quite um quite harsh and in the way the shoes do without a shoe\nElliana Johnson a new uh we've got to let you go you're in a minute but I just wanted to get your take on something that seems to read it said that\nUm that there are some things that Nikki Haley the bathrooms Hayley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to ... you know in her future political career because she was a line so closely with the president\nYou know whether that's two years or four years from now I Know that's forever in American politics but but that's a reality that she's got a she's she's going to be wondering about\nListening both to add ... talk and to a call on top\nAnd I think Nikki Haley I get this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be carrying her accomplishments and everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as at moving the U.S Capitol champion and move of the other day at us embassy to Jerusalem\nThings that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those are things she can run on in a Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to stand in a general election and absolutely\nWell early on a Johnson White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much and I was great to have you thank you

call I I Am an independent voter and I don't want to either party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised by Nikki Haley's\nAttitudes that she took as\nAs a representative to the un he stood up to a lot of the hypocrisy that was shown by the human rights organizations and she stood up to see that characterize\nIsrael as a right wing country and that you know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the ... camp she went she went to visit the Palestinian areas and maybe what happened was\nThat changed that they really weren't so bad left and that\nThat may be why she decided to support Israel and moved to Chicago so on\nWill Vivian Vivian let me go let cold respond to your uh your questionnaire and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nUm I think the I think about the characters are isn't true because I mean she went to the to the you know refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nA and came near ... testified before Congress and made an a passionate personal sort of appeal for them but this these programs really did make life better for them but\nThe alternative was not necessarily be

Security Council vote in which um she was a she was ... you know cast a veto against fourteen hundred ... member she was totally isolated [noise]\nUm the u._s. was isolated in the U.N General assembly afterwards and I think it was after that there's sort of notion that the Palestinians for\nDefying the United states that they were rallying international opinion to get to the United states could really kind of um shifted her kind of orientation actually became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience\nWill of gyms to British someone to come to you and

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nIt in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in your life [noise] um but but there's just not the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nWant to get a sense of you you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt among okay hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think\nPart of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not opened up of adopted children mind you but and I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that the your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race\nI mean thinking about this from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is um I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just\nThings I Wish I had in my toolkit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed is to me that they wish they had\nThen offered more in the way of information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with them about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family\nUm that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know I'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we've gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you know they ask many questions just nobody really was telling them the there's some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how your answer this question or\nTalk to your child about racism and nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to ... to have those conversations I think okay now\nSo I can hear it and fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about uh was was something to difficult enough to handle 'em or no one knew what to do with her how to come through that\nBut in addition to that ... was there was there a longing that you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of was there a longing or an emptiness or something that you felt that needed to be filled because of\nYou know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're combustion as you solve with your parents [noise]\nYeah I think it was it wasn't so much an empty nester I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did keenly feel once I was old enough to notice and once I was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly\nUm I in a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only like ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable um\nI don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships and great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt it I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up it was a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family that was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this is guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true that that might not be and can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what matters finally decided to reach out to them or try to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in the book my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push 'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I haven't become a parent but other times I'm convinced\nThat I Would other eventually start to no matter what you know it's nothing to have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious I wondered um I had gotten a little bit of information on that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petitions basically for non identifying like basic social history no names addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve\nUm but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final punished I remember sitting at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birth\n'em and why I was born so prematurely um because I was I was born about ten weeks early and you and I don't know I had no answer that was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and childbirth I just\nI don't know something about my ... knowing my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family but I was really scared and also [noise]\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like I don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about\nOur family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah my first trimester you know I think\nEvery parent go through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and it can only those questions really become far more acute when there are so many on answered a issues in in the the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm

joining us as well as Joyce McGuire pave oh she is the founder of the center for family connections a nonprofit that serves children and blended families for more than Thirty years\nA note Nicole just I Wonder if you could just\nBriefly tell us what happened when you finally we're reconnected with your with your biological family because I imagined that growing up there's a there's a very understandable tendency to idealize the people that you don't know it was at that but that I deal wasn't wasn't fully realize\nI mean it's always dangerous idea living people you've never met Frank I'm you know a lot of ways it it really was sort of a confirmation of the story I'd gotten as a child but much deeper and richer and more complicated um and it was interesting you know I\nI hadn't thought enough honestly about my birth parents perspective and what it must have been like like what factors could have led to the adoption that was something I guess I wondered about in a way as a kid but I it didn't have them up maybe emotional maturity or knowledge of the world to really consider\nWhat they might have gone through I was not expecting um to find\nYou know a story that had so much like trauma really um and lost that had nothing to do with my adoption you know things that were just difficult if they were dealing with um that you know might have been factors in the adoption certainly but weren't like directly caused by it for example\nUm so when I first reached out to them and I did Sylvia a confidential intermediary a under Washington state law\nAt the time I was placed and then at the time I search that had to go through a third party so that person forwarded a letter from me and before we could exchange any identify information like things like last names and addresses and really specifics about our lives you know we had to get various forms completed and it had to be by mutual consent\nUm so that also made the process take a little bit longer um but I reached out through the intermediary um and my birth parents at the time I found them had been divorced for many years so I wrote to them separately\nAnd and so there's like two different reunions really with two different branches of the family instead of the one and like not easily I had always pictured like talking with and meeting them or reconnecting with him at least like together\nSo that was I was interested I was my first started surprise um and what I found initially a list that they had never told my sisters my biological sisters I have a half sister and a full sister and uh they were living at home at the time I was placed and they'd never been told about the adoption they'd behold I died at birth\nAnd ... right when I wrote to my birth parents um you know do too I think the language barrier or just some difficulty translating the letter um that was sort of how my sister's got involved and how they found out\nAnd it was definitely a shot for them you know as as little as I knew they knew even less than I did and uh so it was really it was like a it was a whole family is sort of reconnection about as I mentioned segmented into like different different branch 'em well that was it was unexpected [laughter] well I mean so Joyce\nAdoptions are so complicated right because you're dealing with the lives the the the lives of so many\nPeople at ... at the ... the most vulnerable point probably in their lives so we've been hearing Nicole say that that her biological parents hadn't even told there are other children I mean how how do you would ...

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nNot support and help and training and and treatment\nBirth parents get the least and they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption that was something that was going on anyway\nUm so this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children um that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there are so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every story is a case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but its novels family story\nYeah and Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of your sisters did you\nKnow ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is did that process than help\nUh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family did it get you to the place that you would hope you were hoping to to to go to I think\nThe primary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched were just simply kind of gaps and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or other other factors I certainly cared about [noise]\nUm I cared about about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is\nOne of the reasons I searched but I think it was really from my sister's especially my ... sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information um you know she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always feel I I I wasn't really part of this family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please fell to medical history and\nIf I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that so that Cindy Cindy with this is her family family the only ones you've got and I think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers\nAnd that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps and knowledge\nNow well this is obviously an issue that has had an impact on many people's lives 'cause we've got a stack of callers and I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call\nUm I was raised in the south or it was sixties or seventies adopted shifting years ago a beautiful young man from a lot of law and my question is is I don't have any experience how do I prepare and my son for living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experience racism John\nYeah I had lived in upper middle class life or when the military where there's very little racism that you know I'm just all face those issue yeah how do I prepare my son to go out in the world he knows very dark he's you know going to face it I don't know what to tell it\nJoyce you have an answer for John well like you know there is a huge question by one of the answers as to make sure you surround yourself with people of color especially\nYou know if he's African American um you know I make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for all models for him and that you look for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Orlando", "day": "11"}
