Arnold Palmer hospital dot com involved in his nomination\nMost serious and lasting injury and all of this is not to me nor is it to all of those who have steadfastly supported by nomination Andrew Marr I'm deeply grateful rather\nThe damage to the dignity and the integrity of law and a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings\nCircles for national disgrace\nAnd from my standpoint\nAs a black American as far as I'm concerned it was a high tech lynching for up all the blacks who in any way Jane to think for themselves [noise]\nTo do for themselves have different ideas and it is a message that unless you count how to an old order this is what will happen to\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't play any tape there because he never even got a hearing\nSo that takes us then to where we are now two thousand Eighteen and just last week president uh Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hair fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand such Gina lectures\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record ... for the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo it looks like a hoping your phone lines but ... you with us now yeah I'm here great ... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\n[noise] I I you know I think it it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically and mistake with the top two really in Folsom clear and very very certain\nWays about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork a and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast\nForward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with very very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of\nTheir actual dot ... is standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no ... balls and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork with the last time we had anything close to a truthful scrutiny of someone's record now what we have is that funny\nPantomime where the nominee pretend that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote in the past has any bearing and I think that sets up a what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent\nThat channel record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now\nThat doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money in the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that but I think at least ... pork was honest and he was when the Senate exercised it's advice and consent it did so knowing\nYeah that's gone well Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that that naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process the proceeds any justices elevation to the high court\nEmphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork ... a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight zero I make ... to to\nUh I think it was euro uh ... I can understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them on almost every issue and even then when I said earlier was true\nEverything you know then they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can argue it's almost impossible not to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe way the Democrats did was a Bork and and what made worker blurb\nWas they smeared him in every conceivable way except as sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know that this is how they thought they could win now with Thomas was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all of all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee\nA he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nI have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges\nOr or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe a then mired him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleague\nWho uh you know who was much more conservative than most and then some of them in some ways but he was an excellent Cali yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person we saw on TV the other day was totally out of character\nFor Kavanaugh in this process I think a drone that directly\nWell and and and a diarrheal this week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans\nIn those hearings themselves but also I mean after Harry Reid first launched the nuclear option or ... nuclear option

court and I'm joined today by Dahlia Lithwick Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is from last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything and this we're\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old is uncertain time place date and no cooperation at best enough for you God help us all as Republicans Gulf this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm [noise]\nYou'd better watch out for your nominee\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the recent quote hysteria is because Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American Life now\nOur political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues introduced legislation that hands lifetime tenure for the judiciary\nBecause if they're just politicians than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break ahead to interrupt you there so that we could take that break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics and the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court doing its actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think you know the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception\nOf the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation that justice is own view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas never fully recovered from what he thinks we're done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten\nHow his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that if Brett Kavanaugh's elevated to the court he will look at some of the groups that are attacked him\nIn anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justice is\nA perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do have to factor\nThe conversation ... I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks who've been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Smith I just wanted to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting or just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we have justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be protests\nSupport for Ninety planes and the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nKnew we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs a nominee for the Supreme Court the politics play a role as always played a role in some sense and also say\nIf you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics at the politics of in places are on the court\nAnd people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but at the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some way to political institutions automatically\nIs legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to follow is dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting so patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic I Want to get to see it from almost be through it first of all um the the point of course is has the legitimacy of integrity or public trust but it all off\nThrough perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a or justice to repeal and replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public's right now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a pop blizzard in modern history and so through the media and through a lot of other things they are uh giving a perception of what is and what is not but\nTo the last several months Donald Trump in his\nA blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with fish don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law I think the public trust has been\nA shaken and I believe the integrity is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limited on terms now because it is simply a political position\nWell Erin thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one ... there about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with justice says\nWell I think term limits as a wonderful idea that's not that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years and an out the problem is it'll never happen\nBecause it would require is maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's gonna who whose people are older\nYou know who's terms or later ... is it going to help the red team and the blue team and they're always be a calculation where one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years\nUm but that's what's going on I think that's what we're going to be seen from for a long time well let's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the ...\nOh thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported cake and\nFor Obama and the uh keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court's role is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that what he's going through thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the air Joe\nI I'm I guess what I figured that law called the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the question was going up or go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justice is whether or not I got the right to marry by August\nAnd now I'm kind of thing that play out of gang where a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that if a white left ideology it seems like it's more of the plane down to\nUm uh what the right it's actually just a code word for religious\nConcierge service celebrations began at ABC F.

to taste Niceville look nice and survival you know fluid Seventy Tice nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and\nI'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for farms are off there if you ... and actually I've met a few of them over the years and I kind of make a swift exit if I get ... by somebody tells me they do it for fun I you know what I'm looking\nIn your book though how to stay alive and on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still is\nThat if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia a dig a hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it and the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole will actually\nCondense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cop and you say there you see here if you you earn eight in the whole before setting up the still moisture new year and will condense into clean drinking water why don't you do that\nYou get the thing is if you're really de hydrated drinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you just into pure waste product\nSo if you can make a certainly still like this you have the you have the the resources to do that paying into the bit around that you're gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're going to get flus out of that but\nIf you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in survival situation for example you call breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrate should you don't want to be paying out those fluids because actually if you appear it's clear\nThat that can actually help ... so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways maybe paying onto your clothes and wrapped around the head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know ... years will figure out how to do a bunch of times I mean it was right she loves looking back into it because what if it was a crew to guide ... things like days we're moving into my teacher just wrapped around my neck you know on the head scarf the pie and [noise] you know but he

gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous tier training and he was talking about how\nUm as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've\nEver experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now\nYeah no festivals the respect fuel service and the ... to be\nA guy you rang in before you're ... you're so right the the the bachelor for survival is one and lost in the mind um the sea of training or something I went through like Roger part of the British special forces or it is long ... tough\nThe time on the ride I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mode focus a okay\nWe're in today is you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks and\nI she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use these job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy days as a loving survived it to look up to yourself and again you know when we now is the crew you know women filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands if you need it you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else to be needed just to put a switch on that well you do you know the ...\n... everything on the right to send my child that but it's all so busy you know I just remembered that see a training I went through to the days when All right it was just due to a doctor and if you collected firewood repairing the setting snags doing that you know\nAnd by the end is how you\nSaw it on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beat you got to keep thinking like you know I always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind go to neutral is always something to be doing to think about the planning\nAnd I'm I'm not sure why it becomes very draining what the times on the road I I think it's three times harder than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere is one of the thing that David said that caught my attention and I just wanted to get a quick response from you cause then actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he was he was ... he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his SERE training and I was thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so she managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges are on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually it\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly me to spend three hours trying to lie to five but that is often the reality you know certainly in the old days on the ...\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing that so many hours and hours settings snags and all that obviously that she was going to make a Rudy boring program you know Seventy guess editor Dana ... bit of music and ... got a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said right at the start of the show survivor summed up three was never\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nArena health network a pediatrician that committed to

and do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked the question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation\nIt's survival situation how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why could not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind tests to attract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter]

Krakauer original book it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women [noise] well hey\nListen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress severely thinks she can snap in the wild and she's also disliked made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit and all the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible Geraldo ekstrom
