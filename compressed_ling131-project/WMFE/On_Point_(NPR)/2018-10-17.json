which I'm a ... ...\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adult had including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to their friendship or the family more information including locations that are lined up health dot com slash kids\nAre Israeli Palestinian peace process\nAnd lost was of the uh relationship the business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis were um instill our reforming diversifying their economy they want us to invest in the United states they want to buy a lot of things from the U.S and build strong connections with us institutions\nBanks universities et cetera so that relationship is uh is is a very personal and titan one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the uh attention and anger that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with\nUm the feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump's\nOkay well Steven Cook of the ... the president has said that he he would value quotes severe punishment right if\nIf a Saudi or influence or us out of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ...\nUh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a that punishment to effect arms sales for example a ... of the at least ten billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what position does is put the president in\n... president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think his statements\nHave ah been an effort to\nProvide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story I think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and his inclination is\nActually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia a uninterrupted I think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis\nWas something where the White House was acknowledging a the pressure and a two weeks for commentary about the disappearance of democracy to\n'em but uh overall uh this is a president who has not made human rights a a priority and hum has looked upon ah Washington's relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned a hundred and ... ... a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal uh which actually was not struck by the Trump Administration boat was actually agree to under the Obama administration but find after President Trump a came into office yeah\nAnd I appreciate the correction that I had said ten billion but you're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal but the point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements this long standing relationship between these two countries in the house sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nDoes that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed multiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other well\nThat has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now\nAre given the fact that the Trump Administration regards the wrong as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region in Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer the United states is\nUm but still many of a Washington is most important allies were trading partners do rely upon\nA oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that the United states is interested in in a global capitalist water or the fact that the Chinese the Koreans the Japanese the Indians are are all depended upon oil coming out of this region in significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia\nThe United states has a a compelling interest\nUh in the greatest stability in supporting Saudi Arabia security well I think\nSo I just wanted to get hurt it's okay I just want to get Bernard Haykel view in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between ... between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm I I think it is impossible and I've described the relationship as a structural relationship not a transactional won even though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia you know started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War and the fight against communism instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible and global market which means that if any disruption happens of Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately\nThey are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American or an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have Islam you have to fight against uh the the radical Islamists the Saudis are instrumental again in fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAt a mom and been some on M. B. S. because he has made it\nA policy of the kingdom to turn away from a Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if you if you succeed in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right also there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or MPs\nI Want to play a clip here uh on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage in hedge point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitments of human rights\nSteven Cook what does the United states\nStands to lose perhaps morally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing close relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] the port for on point comes from Charles River apparel making the new Englander rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare folks for whatever the day has endured the new phone collection is on view at the Charles river apparel dot com and gauge working to make\nHigher education more affordable with us then gauge unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each textbooks online homework access codes and study guides send gauge unlimited C.

Eastern studies at Princeton University and we're at one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five that's eight hundred\nFor two three talk and let's go to some callers here Dolores is calling from Waterford, Pennsylvania you're on the air Dolores\nHigh magna and hello to your gas up if I have a couple of questions I'd like to make a point I I'd if anyone wants to get some good insight into the kingdom of Saudi Arabia they need to read my now al Sharif book daring to drive it's a good insight\nUm it's a good read and it provides a an eye opening a exposure to how these guys operate\nOh here's my question I mean who is going to believe who in their right mind is going to believe that this was conducted by a rogue element you had an individual show up with a bone saw if you I mean to me that's a signal you intended to conduct\nSome sort of nefarious this had been pre medicated and my point\nIs there's only so many so many for second so those reports of for the only the only sources for those reports are Turkish officials are named Turkish officials so that hasn't actually been independently confirmed it just I just want to remind folks of that but go ahead oh\nOkay and hear Donald Trump\nIs the one who has claimed\nThat the media is the enemy of the people and only not only speculating of course 'cause I don't have evidence but in my mind if I'm looking at this and you have\nYou know the world leader claiming that the media is the enemy of the people I mean an MBA circle they think well what shall we can take this guy out who's going to care ...\nI mean I personally I think Trump could care less about the show in that interview on the White House lawn yesterday was you know another act it's another lie I mean I Am hoping that Congress and I'll get some intestinal fortitude hair and can can do something\nYeah um and that show the global dictators that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump a gift and Donald Trump but that the U.S Congress is going to start taking some action against the human rights violations that are occurring around the globe will\nDoors thank you for your call Steven Cook let me turn turn that to you a first of all do it two doors this assertion that the president's own rhetoric against journalists may have emboldened ah folks like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\n[noise] yeah and this is something that has been part of the commentary since uh the first reported missing a democracy choked gee I'm In I think that certainly it's unfortunate that the president refers to pursue the enemy of the people\nUh it certainly under scores for dictators around the world that the the White House will will downplay attacks on the media but let's also be clear\nUm people like Vladimir prudent Turkey's president reject type aired won a others around the world the Chinese um are are arresting journalists harming journalist\nSo one can imagine that uh if the decision was made at the highest ah levels in Saudi Arabia\nThey looked around the world and they saw how the Russians are killing people and small British towns or in Dupont Circle Washington DC Dupont Circle who tells the Chinese are rounding up people turkey is the leading jailer of journalists in the world none of those countries have paid a price for that\nAnd that ah the\nMust have believed that they wouldn't pay a price\nSupport for Ninety point have the

important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that are Random House dot com slash kids\nOkay so I'm going to explore that a little\nMore in the second specifically regarding some of the things that ... himself had has said about a\nA crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but but Steven Cook there was a point that you mentioned a much early in the program that I should have dug deeper and into and that is um how much does the president's personal business interests in Saudi Arabia first of all what are they specifically and how much do you think\nThat is influencing or his approach to this current diplomatic crisis\n[noise] well there's all kinds of allegations concerning the president and his family's business ties with Gulf monarchies I'm I'm not aware that there's a Trump International hotel in Riyadh\nUm but ah there are a extensive links between the Trump organizations in countries all over the world and this is a a continuing question whether ah the president is making decisions based on his family is a personal financial interests or on behalf of the United states\nUm we do know that um the the government of Qatar through ah an investment fund\nHas invested in a building in New York City that was in tremendous debt that's owned by the Christian or companies\nQatar and Saudi Arabia are at odds so um there's a lot of different uh business interests and it's very very hard to pinpoint specifically about how the president is making decision on on these issues I think any president in United States would be in a tremendously awkward position\nWith allegations coming from a NATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had murdered someone and they're constantly in in in Turkey is you know main city\nAh how the president would respond to that anybody occupying the oval office would be trying to weigh the ... how much to emphasize a values and freedom of press in protections for the ...\nVersus a relationship with a country like Saudi Arabia well\nAnd look the Saudis spend a lot of money in Washington right the Washington Post is reporting that Saudi Arabia plowed twenty seven million dollars into lobbying in Washington Jeff last year making it one of the highest spending country seeking to influence U.S policy that's according to\nPublic records are well let's take another call here said is calling from Green Bay Wisconsin said you're on the air\n... I Am calling to rank an alarm bell on the on over reaction to the um the situation\nI'm In terms of bending to the political domestic political forces have international Middle Eastern countries themselves the greatest violators of human rights who are trying to exploit this situation in order to affect American foreign policy\nI remind us of a similar situation we were in in Nineteen Seventy six or ... American president Jimmy Carter make human rights they central piece of his foreign policy\nPricing pressure on the bench already on a on human rights record\nResulting displacement and the conversion of the coast in Arkansas light at the ... then to the greatest American Fall\nAnd a significant deterioration of human rights or in Iran resulting in over a million Iranians you get ...\nAnd the Seventy million living under tyranny is what happens when when I was in Iraq and foreign policy um treats human rights as if they saw and point and does not understand the strategic dimensions that are involved in that in in our relations\nSaid thank you for your call or Bernard Haykel what is how do you respond to said\nWell I I think he makes a good point and the and and the story that he tells about Iran is a this is certainly true\nUm I I think that uh you know the the point that he's trying to make as far as Saudi Arabia is concern is that you know there is a very important strategic relationship here\nUm that the that the states that are engaged in let's say the Turks are with their campaign of of uh of leaks ah\nHe'll join us that's coming up next our ...\nHi I'm Jeremy ... opposite of here and now W.

concussions he suffered as a top tier NASCAR driver a he's a two time winner of the Daytona five hundred Fifteen time winner of NASCAR is most popular driver award and a earlier in the hour we talk in detail about two concussions that he suffered in two thousand twelve but those were not his first I mean in the book\nDale Earnhardt junior writes about how in Nineteen Ninety eight for example his car rolled in a race\nAnd his head hit the roll cages so hard that his helmet had put put a big dent into the bar that was in Nineteen Ninety eight crash\nAnd then in two thousand to April twenty eighth he crashed during the Napa auto parts five hundred at the California speedway infant ten of California\nWomen were taunting\nThe rest of the personnel [noise]\nNot to bring my gums and your brain job would be in the bars and the memory systems and everything else [noise]\nGuy I think we've got to recall governor [laughter] theory for your call it is\nYeah definitely that long pause that's what everyone hoped it all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision and a ... a beer than in the car was the only thing that really helped me decide ah [noise]\nYou know exactly how bad the situation was and now how long I needed to get better so I Know better next time I should've kept a secret as much as I did but um [noise]\nYou know I didn't want to cause through much alarm because it really wasn't a series I guess everybody has made it out to be\nDale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two well joining us now is Michael Mickey Collins he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program\nAnd he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior for concussion in two thousand twelve you also wrote the forward for a racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey call is welcome to employees\nOr it's really great to have you because uh obviously as as Diehl writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office I mean you've treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes\nAnd the what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\n[noise] well I've seen him twice um two thousand twelve and two sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale\nWe actually got the better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapy the second time I saw detail\nHe was very sick with these issues that we commonly see with a concussion and quite honestly I I didn't care as much about bill becoming a race car driver again I Want a deal to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd I just don't hear though because I mean the to the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems uh all the all the things I hand eye coordination\nThe things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving it two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of way of life you know\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to parents central Florida family more information including locations that are laying down health dot com slash kids\nIn terms of identifying where the average signals coming from and matching the right treatment to the right problem and and we were able to do that with the L and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and said I'm On a course of rehab that um that eventually got better and and Dale is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nYeah so uh that Mickey Collins I think one thing that surprised me about what the ... in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very very specific specific regimen of exercises and other political essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that\nUh perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when a brain is healing from from concussions\nI that's a common perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment we've actually identified now that there are six different types of concussions and there was some types of concussions where quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated\nBut in details profile of difficulties ... the way you treat the problems are Dale had is actually ... training and so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach or whether the rate you know regulation or whatnot but\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again where is the average single coming from and then and then matched the right tribute to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because\nThis is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous event if this if this thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nYeah we'll Dale Earnhardt junior in in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins\nThat you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver culture is like but you did hear from some drivers who had either previously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help [noise]\nYeah actually that was so ah\nInteresting I guess I'm you know a hearing from retired drivers or even drivers that had a just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and looking and just really just to be able to contact Mickey how to get to\nPittsburgh where he was in and see him [noise]\nUm that was\nI think the beginning of the\nReason for writing this book and make you told me time and time again\nOr whether it's an article someone's red or use red or whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here and he'll tell you that he has people that come in every week that um connect\nUh you know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be open and transparent\nHas a resulted in this book and ah you know so that I I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's you know I've made friends by meeting strangers\nAnd directing them to Mickey and continuing to support them and continuing to you know encourage them through the process and made some pretty good friends to sorry to interrupt\nYou there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Mickey Collins that you said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "17"}
