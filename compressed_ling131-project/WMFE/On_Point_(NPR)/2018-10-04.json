Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nOr two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nAshley Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth and the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc and they're ... not monolithic\nAs Brennan was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and Latino they're set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard that's a lot from people who work in democratic politics who said that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group\nA Latino voters is that they haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore costs a lot of money and Texas and progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see\nA good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party I'm here in Texas by it it just you know it takes a lot more work\nThan has yet be done I see\nA brand of running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent\nYeah they're they're low overall um\nRecent polling has got I'm worried about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising you there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nTed Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of more continuous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump but there's a lot of friction so\nI see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here as potentially influential in this race I mean white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election that's really gonna what's probably drive any kinds of success that Iraq fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challenges the congressional level many of whom have\nA really harness this vote and could potentially do well but I also think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks considerably in favor of better work they don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for\nPeople who are over forty but it is the case with those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual growth of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being a poor partner places like Ford been county here outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another\nLevel of success that Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in the in this race in November\nWell it's always the wild card and elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always sad Viguerie than that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it because it's a non voting stay there if you get all these populations who don't usually vote\nThat could change what tax it looks like if you changed the electorate you can change who gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term\nI mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and\nAnd angry and you know all that they typically like Democrats are likely to vote during that time so if if that is different this year like this could look different than most mid term yeah so I'm seeing for example\n... wrote to um uh a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever shown up and listen to you talking to to to voters or or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so is he hoping\nTo draw out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the taxes that we've seen in other places we saw that in New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nLike what he's betting on yeah go ahead rented I'm Sorry\nOh sorry I was going to say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout in ... in mid term years you're talking about\nProbably on the order of about forty percent which is\nExtremely low now I think will have a turnout probably like a little bit in the selection because you definitely have the energy that we've seen 'em and so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you still have about two and a half million unregistered Texans who could otherwise register the Latino population\nIs only registered to vote at about birding forty four percent and that number was about eighty percent for Anglo so there are still some fundamental voting demographics would make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide\nOkay well I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should note that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and two ... campaign as well invited them or a one of the represent their representatives to join us today\nA Iraq's campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our requests but we do our due diligence on that part but let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his\nContentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen the election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president\nOn substance in we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax cut them a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations for seeing record low unemployment Texans lives are better so yeah I could have chosen\nNow at ... dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from Carver night offering secure data protection solutions for growing

point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez Brandon rotting house and Abby Livingston\nAs well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to end and watching on TV [laughter]\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\n[laughter]\nYou know\nMore more\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto O'Rourke campaign and here's some sound from an ad that we're both Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running and\n\nRuled by\nAn ad there from Senator Ted Cruz running house that that Ted Cruz at ... ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership of the ideas that\nI'm a that you may be liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah but you're going to say this was something of the whole the whole dear because it's what country music but I sure that's true as well there's definitely a a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign to understand how to run in Texas they know that there's a certain sorry guys as you say for\nVoting um to keep your people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely on off Republican support\nYou in a midterm election dot on organic\nKind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans for what he's conservative policies can work or walk\nAfter tangibly make up about a million votes and the just trust God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in the term so the difficulty of trying to make up that with a campaign like Cruz's running which prime Republicans and primes conservatives it just makes it really difficult well\nLet's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air\nHi I'm just calling and I made millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I had voted for Donald Trump\nAnd and I grew up in a conservative household and they had then it's conservative Michael family it but I've been very encouraged and I and go for that to avoid that election in November just because people can be on party lines and I think that's so important\nTo 'em in the day and age right like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so we were in that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that is going out there and and making it a point to meet people where there are ... and and I really appreciate what he's doing\nChristine touched a few quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year yes I did okay so what's changed other hand\nThat um I really I whenever he within twenty six the election\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're

locations that serves central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nOh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that you're a true um I think it's so important about ... true colors men how he just\nWas really again President Trump knows any forehand like you know that even think about the need personality you know I really appreciate how that will work is just um he is doing it\nYou can ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that ah you you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the ... campaign recently right to\nA controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he in the review he wrote some I'm\nAn unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seemed to be their phenomenally large\nBody parts and you may it does that concern you\n[noise] um I I don't know um [noise]\nI Know he's apologized for it ...\nAnd um\nI I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for some Mickey at all I just don't get that for women's rights\nYeah ... I I just want to say I don't know is a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so who thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare\nBut on the other hand I mean she talked the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more positive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things I from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In ... in taxes that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women has been should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a conundrum he was and I do think if this is John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just an eye different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave\n'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came up from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military in Oregon ... ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful\nUm and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated frankly with people like me and the vision of public Trump's and power who have been unable to resolve is bring jobs just for what has been going and this is all for generating dressed up in this country and so we usually\nWhile they argue this country are watching these games they treat me to bring attention to this problem to ensure\nThat we strictly about why they're doing it and I can think of nothing more Americans [noise]\nActually Lopez or other mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in\nSupport for Ninety point seven new comes from Florida hospitals executive health program\nPartnering with companies throughout Florida the executive health program provides a one day health evaluation for executives leadership teams individuals and couples convenient comprehensive and personalized care for the business of life more information I S H executive house dot com\n\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ...

weight center and she's with us\nIn our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of go you gave us the top three bullet points of the\nUh aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand so let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what do you mean\nOh well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago my call this is high I I was like we hung out together [laughter] so yeah I Know it was really fun ask 'em\nAnd I think I mean if it's even though there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic Lee healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage\nOf fat people with metabolic Lee healthy obesity in some studies find a much larger percentage and I actually you know Fifteen or feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter\nThat we know how difficult wages to lose and we know how harmful it is to shame people for their weight\nAnd so if there are big health effects of obesity I'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important you know I mean I I think it's fine to talk about the health written in the same way you know I'm a gay man\nTheir health risk associated with gay people were more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things\nBut he needs to talk to me about those things in a\nHealthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices what are your drug use practices and not in this way that\nHello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that I mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino is the way that you guys had an hour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them and that's something that with primary care providers a lot of patients never gets that luxury of somebody\nAsking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them\nWell a lot of patients period will never get that luxury with their primary care physician doctor to ever go ahead\nYeah so I Want to touch on a few points number one I Want to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I I can tell you that patients on the extremes meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity\nI'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has either mild moderate to severe obesity\nI'm so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes wheat buys and stigma is what I Want us to to make sure that we don't do that\nNow this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity\nIs such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define clearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology\nWhat we're finding is that this term metabolic fully healthy obesity as as a little bit falling out of favor because what we're finding is that even in patients where things appear normal on the surface\nThey do have issues so for example\nI have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients that obviously have moderate to severe obesity um and when you look at them they may have no obesity ... more but conditions at the time of surgery\nWhat we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and what's that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease\nNow if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound that their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have a liver disease but when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence that we're sending to surgery\nActually have fatty liver disease Ninety five percent or Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this\nSo that shows you that we're not picking up on something in a way that we\nMight in an adult patients who question about this because I think you know there's something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing out like but but why should a neurologist though\nBe talking to someone about their weight when that person's there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said Dr Stanford because how and they're all just isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway\nBut let's look at what you guys just said and this is going to put it on my medical ... because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity have a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs they are ... that are used to treat migraine headaches also are great for weight loss\nSo when I find that my patients and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients have a history of migraine headaches and have obesity I might concurrently be treating with the medication both disease process is I'm getting rid of\nTheir migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation so I Would say that they're neurologist approaching them\nMaybe from the lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all Oregon system soon at all it is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that\n[noise] well I think I mean the story that I'm hearing\nFrom fat people are not that they're neurologists are saying you know we have a couple of morbidity do you mind if we run some tests the stories that I'm hearing are we won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing for people that their doctors refused to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors refuse to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight\nI think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate\nWeight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor\nAnd I think that it's it's really worthwhile to separate those two things because not every factors and go to the doctor seeking to lose weight a lot of them feel like their life is fine if you like your habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already aren't planned by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight and some other way\nAll they needed a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get on a train accident\nThey need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix that ... D located shoulder\nAnd so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that\nAnd so it's very important I think for us not to generalize from her own experience when it comes to\nWeight well when we come back we're going to take a lot more callers because there are tons of them were one eight hundred for two three to five to eight hundred for two three talk\nWe're talking about maybe somehow figure out a way to rethink how we approach the obesity epidemic in America and Michael ... joins us to to stop right or the Huffington Post\nHe's written about this and we have a link to his story I don't play radio dot org and Dr for team of Cody Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity specialist at Massachusetts General hospital again were eight hundred for two three eight to five five we'll be right back I'm Talking about\nThanks for listening to Ninety point seven news I'm Danielle prior and I hope you're having a great and I love your week so far let's take a look at the weather for the rest of the evening we do have a twenty percent chance of showers ahead otherwise partly cloudy with a low around semi three gotta love those fall temperatures\nAnd then tomorrow Thursday we got about thirty percent chance of showers and thunderstorms otherwise uh mostly sunny morning with a high near Ninety for more weather and news updates check out our Web site where W.
