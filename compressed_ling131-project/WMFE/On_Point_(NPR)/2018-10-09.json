I'm Sorry to jump in here but but are you telling me that like your your out trying to trying to turn out the vote for the midterms\nYou got it and you got it and I was doing it prior to what courage ever been I don't care whether Republican a damning independent get out and get into the neighborhoods\nNeighborhoods where people are really suffering and and you know come on at Republican Dems need to get down into these neighborhoods and see what's going on for these people who can't access jobs who who are living in ... Helms was in shambles\nRight go prior Kathleen I'm gonna I'm so sorry to interrupt them and take it back from you there because I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guests here\nA polar read your hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of them saying he's gonna you gonna vote Republican almost entirely across his ballot for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen there in Ohio things she's going to try and turn out democratic\nVotes so I mean how much can we tell how much has this fight over justice Kevin are really further energized I'm a voter's going into the midterms\nWell it is certainly energized voters going to the midterms to question is whether or not the G O P can ...\nOver the next month because well I said look the cabinet confirmation process did not go how the White House had hoped but the one upside for them is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm election the poll showed that it was helping them sort of closes enthusiasm gap they were having trouble closing\nOn their own mentality has been confirmed now that they've sort of solidified have solidified\nHonest conservative majority on the Supreme Court the question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president I can just over the weekend and I can hear him say this again him and his allies trying to sort of frame this as it's all Democrats trying to obstruct their agenda with vendors for the Trump\nUm that the Trump victory in presidential campaigns to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November now there's no question that that folks on the other side democratic progressive that they are certainly mobilized and this has been a catalyst for many of them to vote aren't card others to vote\nBut again the big challenge for the president is allies can you sustain this month now Dick Pullman a here in\nPennsylvania we've got a brand new district map congressional district map and so there we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't on thrown out in the last cycle here so how much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh affect what's going to happen here no\nWell I think you're [noise] you know the cabinet things really in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly than the old when this when the new districts were by court ah and um they're much more sort of a\n... they're much more of a sort of appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican bugs and the oldest for 'em and put the Kavanaugh\nThing the kennel things ... and go to just sort of beer capper on a lot of the energy that has driven a lot of suburban white women's bourbon worried educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we've been talking about a blue wave for months uh I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports mouthed increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is it all depends how to do is you know something\nIs going to land disproportionally in different places so a lot of these house districts were which were are strong suburban districts like a lot of the ones around Philadelphia a are\nUm are being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of Republicans over a lot of things carbon are being nearly\nThe latest saw you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me the ... when the house and we need a net gain of twenty three you're probably going to pick up five or so in Pennsylvania alone home there's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide that are that Republicans have\nThat Hillary Clinton won the presidential vote\nIn in twenty sixteen those are very vulnerable so I think this whole thing about ... go to it's going to fall different different places the red state Senate red state Senate seats the Democrats have now that's where I can see a lot more Republican enthusiasm may be making a difference from from the\nNorth Dakota and Heidi Heitkamp\nRight she she might she might be told McConnell Mitch McConnell may be right when he says this is going to energized Republicans to keep the Senate the house I'm sure\nWe'll so he'll couple I'm going to come to you here in a second but ah since ... mentioned the Senate and we had that caller Kathleen from Ohio expressing her just tastes for Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her vote to confirm justice Kevin ... we have a uh some tape here from Senator college she spoke with Scott Kelly on CBS is sixty minutes last night\nAnd said she felt very comfortable with her says her decision

member station W H y y in Philadelphia and we are joined today by Dick Pullman he's national political reporter and writer of the national interest blog\nAt WHYY polar read is also with us She's CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs and it's a huge ... joined us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics and the hill I wanted to turn something to you here because we heard Paula uh especially talking about before the break that\nThe president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice Kavanaugh has kind of around a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other big issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily health care is has that sort of been temporarily set aside or do you think that that will will come back to voters and and Kennedy to gonna come back to focus on these persistent\nIssues are that the the the country still grappling with\nYes healthcare certainly has not subsided that whatever happens in Washington you know what whatever kind of a a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle is happening healthcare has remained\nIn more ... than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election it's deeply personal to them and I think the uh the efforts to repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act inflamed that debate\nAh and and kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here is that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals in that as\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and the last we've seen the president's approval is\nSomewhere hovering around forty percent that's historically not good usually uh the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're Provo is at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but Democrats have in more and more polls and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans in the Senate he is very he's in a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidates or trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered Democrats so it breaks down differently in different places that Republicans have kind of a dream of a Senate map where\nYou know twelve out of the Thirteen most competitive races are in states that President Trump won in about half of them by massive margins\nRight well I mean as you mentioned in and Dick actually mentioned before the break that mid term generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you know could\nMake it a tough tough tough challenge for Republicans are this coming November but on the other hand because of the acrimony over the cabinet or a confirmation and nomination we are hearing\nRepublican leaders talking about re energized the base I mean Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on CBS his face the nation just yesterday saying that democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation have actually reinvigorated Republican voters\nIronically the ... first though Democrats all the Senate Judiciary committee and then the overreach of the protesters at the Capitol is actually energize the Republican base up particularly in a red stage where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to say I want to buy the\nOther side from the doctor it sort of allowed us to got to energize and get involved all of voters\nDick Pullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings or the or the low approval ratings that we have the president\nWhile you may be on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know I [noise]\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician they're

to their income so that really has been point very well\nThey did promise to a ball of abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact where Democrats used to run away from Obamacare has a campaign issue\nThis year particularly on the house side they're bracing it and it's not just I just see it around here in Pennsylvania so I flew over just across the river here in South New Jersey a there's a long time Republican congressional seat that is a very uh it may took to the Democrats this time because the Democratic candidates by the name of Andy Kim\nA is every day he's stressing healthcare\nA and they don't talk about you know they're not talking ... aren't really talking that much about Kavanaugh much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of\nFundamental kitchen table stuff\nUh that um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any a protest but potentially temporary spikes\nIn Republican enthusiasm so I think where McConnell's doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they send enough and they still go up enough you know the hope and believe becomes reality but I think they have a a a ways to go on closing the gap\nWill polar read I'm going to go to a couple of callers you but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at this um you know issues like like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in ah Pennsylvania New seventh district or just this weekend and a lot of talk\nAbout health care and actually relatively less about cabinet himself all the women across the board were very energized\nI think that's right you know Kavanaugh certainly something that's that's transfixed that's here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership there was interest but I don't know necessarily how\nMuch oil guy feel the polls even President Trump's election\nEdited come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammer the president offered her a on their part about health care act and they're a promise that made and and not kept yet\nYeah stick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they wanted to circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point\nThat you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made long term changes like that can that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or they're you know the sale to just turn to do with voters here do you think they should\nNow well I yeah I think they should I think they should have I think they should have a long time ago I'm a ... you know maybe there's this whole notion maybe a lot of Democrats hold on this notion that ah the courts are\nUh are impartial an independent and peoples and voters don't like to think of them as being partisan battlegrounds\nAh but the Republicans have successfully\nA campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight was talking about\nThe ah the warranty Earl Warren court and how would the law you know we need more law and order campaign against according sixty eight successfully and some so for years Democrats have not\nThey have not stress the court ah ah and I felt that they did what happened with the Merrick Garland in twenty six you know I think if you flip the parties around and and a Republican ... a Republican president but an office and had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee\nAnd he didn't even get it and get a hearing say from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I said I don't understand why the ... yeah so he'll go ahead\nSorry I I just wanted to add a it's a great point that they can make because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and and the Berger court through the seventies things like\nAh Miranda rights for criminal suspects brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court bank racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built\nA very very successful and very effective movement a messaging with voter mobilization with millions and

Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd he just took it upon themselves to say fairness I mean you know what we think it means and they drew in the process what was the one analyst called the Democrats dream math so it was that was just such a huge just to take it unconstitutional taking of power by the ...\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives are ski let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when did Georgia talked about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out\nYes and so the timeline here was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of their right to free an equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislature said OK guys you know give us your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we all these um these contingencies of different groups handing in math and just those Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now and they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes the governor was supposed to approve the map and that the legislature um came up with it didn't happen it didn't happen\nFirst of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders there there was never pass by the general assembly in a form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court and in all fairness to both sides of the Supreme Court did not give the legislature I think adequate time to come up with a map even if the legislature could have come up with a map when when I met him and they went back to\nThere's a clause in the constitution known as free an equal yeah which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong\nOr merely suggesting that they went back into a the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find it\nThere yeah let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because they saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but but Terry's indicating here that\nBut this was a a novel reading wherever the audition well I think you also have to look\nAt the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making that decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean they ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and are going into the federal court it could have gone on and on and on for a relatively long period of time as it worked its way up to the to the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge off of you know different theory in federal court that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nOkay so there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now and that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty somethings seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nNow but the reason why I wanted to come here because I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether you know gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering will we get\nMore moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend to to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper\nPolarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and here's what some voters in ... valley told us about what they see\nThe paper plates free for the church and uh there's pumpkin\nPastry and pulled pork on the table at the Chapman quarries United Methodist church it's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidate Marty no Stein\nA bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled walls reminding members to keep Jesus after cold\nIn the middle of the road a volunteer has set up a life sized cut out of President Trump giving a thumbs up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign\nOf a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals\nThe Lehigh Valley was previously split into a long lobster shaped district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nHis old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight point Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nI like to think of the way I value as a microcosm of the United states blue dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas and urban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we were always taught about\nRogers calls no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate won a cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics\nNo Stein also advocates for strict term limits but he falls in line with a GOP on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNo Stein is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call\n[noise] um I I'm from a you love this district in Pennsylvania just paying is running and um I also helped I also did some volunteer work for a short Scott any a tenth district\nAnd I was\nHappy to see these two districts are now competitive especially the ... district but um\nI'd really like to see the actual rainy a little further in this direction and make it more fair mhm and I really wonder why shouldn't this be more of a mathematical\nModel a procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to topple after the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population and the counties J uh boundaries are\nRight it's a good question Jason and I mean he lives are even phones issue for a long time\nWhat do you think yeah I think you've got a great point there and and under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling um you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know a congressional districts need to be ... compact they need to be continuous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that you know I'm\nGoing forward or the ruling does say that there are these neutral criteria that needs to be considered before part is concerned but you know the court didn't go so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes too partisan so there's it's day but there there are some guidelines that you know or the legislature can use going forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the point\nThat the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of out of district map drawers or politics always going to be part of this process\nOr I don't think you can I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both trying to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre in these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better a jury may during because of the nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level you want to just been\nKnocked the district or the warrant level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nOther one's still is is that the rules for the algorithm August when I was thinking we see computers can do a better outlook take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThe secretary Michael I live in northern Sonoma County up to Akron, Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican governor and Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over in ... northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressmen were were they see and it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our democratic congressman Mm\nYeah man I'm going to go ahead Harry would make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just that the Republicans picked\nUp sixty three house seats or put it in another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats but that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be officers thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando

teenage years later health has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nAll these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state that has a huge difference on writing the laws\nOf each day you know that govern drinking at exactly and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election was huge not just in terms of the bringing the Tea Party to power the ideological conservatism that represents\nGo ahead Lindsey yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the was they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined the Democrats would do that that's being nonpartisan about I Know you're not parties and but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there is a district in Maryland yeah so this is not parties in both parties will do that\nWell that's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it and there have they have done here in\nPennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere to people keep talking to me about Marilyn a California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to them and let me let me play for you I'm\nA a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino de Georgia oh he's ... GOP chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just take he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here in the second he puts his other systems to drop future congressional map and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best position to draw a line than\nThey are today heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation that draws party you know political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps that are favors in other states like Maryland so you know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder\nFair disturbing plan they called it to take back congressional seats and they've done it here in Pennsylvania that\nBattle to Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair students' lives are so he he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the map but there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania\nI just have to say I love that um operatic music behind fail in Columbus Day festival in Philadelphia is taking me there to shout Philly um so\nYou know I'd I'd grouped in Pennsylvania their districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement and independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they've modeled this after California\nAnd and this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them and events canvassing and you know uh they they they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interests to form this commission as you pointed out\nIf there is such a commission in California made up of a appointed independent citizens and I think some several others a couple of other states in the west have similar similar commission so ... do they work they have they created fair districts", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "09"}
