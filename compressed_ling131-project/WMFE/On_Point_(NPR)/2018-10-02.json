Arnold Palmer hospital dot com week\nWhat I heard him I heard someone who\nI Hope I Would sound like if I had been unjustly accused and to see his family behind the ... and ah\nIt was it was anger um but um but if I were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well\nAnd the Chris there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was also interviewed by sixty minutes and correspondence Scott Kelly ask tunes are about the the claim or the ... the belief that parts of Kavanaugh's testimony and his demeanor in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line\nA lot at all surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a partisan argument that would've been best left to be made for that ticket to the fighters on the committee made you wonder about is sort of building\nIn my case yes it made me wonder about his ability to sort of event\nThat's democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there and I keep making the same mistake I keep saying might judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here a cheat with human burns let me just pick up with you 'cause you're speaking to this point before the break here\nI Wonder um you know all day on Thursday Democrats focus on their call for investigation\nThey got one they got an investigation you know it's currents terms they may not like but I'm Wondering if you think they missed an opportunity here because you know many folks did look at for example that paragraph in judge Kavanaugh was opening statement where he talks about a left wing conspiracy talks about\nThe Clintons 'em and\nYou know that perhaps some folks might say they should just simply point at that uh as evidence for of what you know might be judge Kavanaugh suit ability or lack of for the Supreme Court\nRight I think that paragraph was particularly revealing for a lot of people watching because um remember we're talking about they see as the potential swing seat on the court from I'm at a conservative and a ideological perspective\nBut when Kavanaugh was talking about the Clintons and the left wing conspiracy I think it did raise questions about whether he would in fact be a part a sense I'm a political type of person\nAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if the conversation starts to evolve this week away from the events in question and the Nineteen eighties and more towards Kavanaugh suit ability for the court or the question though and that the point that I Would make is that\nYou know a lot of lawmakers made their decisions about ... even before these allegations surfaced you had many Democrats come out as soon as Kavanaugh was nominated or shortly thereafter saying that they could not support him and you had lots of Republicans\nAh really cheering him on\nSo there is a question of you know how much the events of ... that we learned last week how much we learned this week\nHow much it will actually change minds I think Republicans also are considering\nThat the idea that they have wanted to shape the makeup of the court that's been an organizing principle for them and election after election\nAnd so they have to kind of weigh that against the allegations that they've already heard Andy against any new information that comes out this week that pertains to the events in question and also that pertain to Kavanaugh's at personality and his fitness for the corn\nWell Michael warn me chime in here because if as Kaitlin says we do start hearing more Democrats talking about issues of temperament will that argument hold any weight now because there has been so much emphasis placed on allowing the FBI to investigate\nA magnet I think if that's where the argument shifts this as Kaitlin suggest to might\nUm it suggests that break Kevin I was going to be confirmed as a Supreme Court or or to the Supreme Court\nI mean this is I'm a respect for you I think a a ... that his uh his testimony his anger you're in that are in that testimony on Thursday or somehow revealed something about the kind of justice he would be\nWhat we're not hearing is any sort of analysis of his actual time on the bench he's a he said on the DC circuit court one of the most powerful or courts in the country or in this claim about his partisanship has never been made\nOr perhaps a bright somebody will now perhaps somebody will go back through some of his decisions and find it but so far they haven't I'm a I'm In and I think Jeff Flake is getting at something here rubber flick is one of the three Republican senators who were on the fence about cabinet none of the Democrats\nAre who are who are including Chris Coons were mentioning they're concerned about his temperament of what really ever going to vote for him in the first place um will Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski a and Jeff Flake or change their mind because of the uh the angry where your which\nCapital responded to what he claims are smears\nUm I don't think so if if the if the investigation finds out the Kavanaugh's whine about this or has a lot about anything anything else that he's been accused of that will change things up but but the anger on display or I think a won't make a difference with the people who who matter in this decision which are those three Republican senators\nI Want to take a quick call here on this point let's go to Rick who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the Iraq\n[noise] Ricky there though magnet high yeah go ahead Richard\nUh I really don't have too much\nFaith that he will not be pushed around a district court so I'm going to be asking [noise] perhaps pretty civic lesson if he is a\nAcquainted and confirmed um when will he\nWill have to decide how many cases you have to recuse himself because it is a blast it out to carry it or the Clinton years and there are conspiracy or the other members or the court will decide [noise] wanting to recuse should and should not be used\nRick and Rick thank you for your call peer Thomas you want to pick up on that because\nUh I think if you know a ... judge Kavanaugh on Thursday he talked about well funded left wing groups et cetera and if you're one of those quote unquote left wing groups and you bring a case before the Supreme Court would you be right to be concerned about a ... a justice cabinet if the if he so becomes\nHis ability to fairly ... like that\nYou know it's interesting a\nLot of the things that were said again we're out of anger I think what the caller is picking up on is the invoking of the Clinton for example that\nOffering super is a line of vehicles that nearly sports Hebrew south we're buying comes with a commitment to lifetime care what's up pressure dealer the online at ... dot com and now at sports the roost south dot com [noise]\n\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from exact science is offering

com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour with Caitlin Huey burns she's CBS News digital political reporter also with peer Thomas chief justice correspondent for ABC News and make a war and senior writer at the Weekly Standard and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for it to three talk\nOr and I want to talk with all the about the midterms here and just a just a second here appear you said something before the break I wanted to follow up on 'em in particularly because you're justice correspondent for ABC News about\nHow the the purpose and intent of the FBI's background ongoing or background investigation right now are into the allegations around judge Kavanaugh that that's supposed to provide some of the detail and clarity a around these allegations that until now we possibly do right\nBut I mean I just want your thoughts on this like so many people over the weekend and even today are saying how can we possibly get trustworthy clarity is the FBI isn't even investigating things like the allegations of a judge Kavanaugh excessive drinking in college we have multiple people coming forward saying\nThey want they want to talk to the to the to the federal agents about this um but perhaps no one's reaching out to them to hear them\nBut I I guess we have to be very careful about describing what the investigation will unfold for example a mystery mirrors talks about the fact of the incident happening at Yale University\nSo the FBI interviews hurt and they get information from her regarding other people who may have known about this move contemporaneously\nSo therefore if the FBI goes in talks with those people they may end up getting information that speaks to\nWhether judge Kavanaugh a drink to excess whether he has a demeanor changed so that may end up in what's called the FBI three oh two which is through the report that they fall regarding what the witness to start again the FBI will draw no conclusions about\nWho's telling the truth or not but what you may end up as a body of work which includes witness after witnessing the same kinds of things and again we'll that support\nThe judge Kavanaugh's version of the story or will it ... you know attack\nThere was a little and I mean ... I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office to say here's the lifted people you can talk to full stop [noise]\nBut we don't know if they have to go back to the White House who sorry we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident\nCan we go talk to them um typically the FBI has the ability and the authority to do do that uh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most again the question here and we're we're tiptoeing around it is\nIs there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client their directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they want answered but at the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Cameron are approved confirmed\nAnd there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty or if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that hasn't been made public at All right\nWell it's in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred or who will vote on who is a nomination will be able to get access to it the question\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years or Leno health over twenty pediatric locations that serves central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nSo let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the midterms here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who is not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he told Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection\nHis decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different\nCooking who have done this\nIf you were running or not you're not a chance show\nNo because politics has become too short\nTo Puerto ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nMichael Ward I'm seeing here also is just a recent study from Pew that says that uh Seventy six percent of potential midterm voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee with a process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this\nA it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says\nThat the political parties organizer animosity use them up you know politics is as much about\nUh uh who do or maybe a little nicer if you're not like who do not want to see in power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been in organizing force for Democrats who who are true woken up uh in our own are expecting a good election in the midterms\nUm my question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up an an energized to vote in the midterms\nI think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans a have a have been energized huh I don't think the Trump Administration has gone on a has given Republicans much to be excited about\nPerhaps a and walk away to see how ... is a week or so after the uh the the hearings last week\nUm perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege me uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the ways that are that women voters might respond\nI'm a you know anecdotally ... from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite of you that you might expect and say that I'm actually judge Kavanaugh's treatment\nUm ah as make them more willing to go out and vote for Republicans we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this is something that does animate voters or in a way that uh that that that does energized from to get out of the whole re a in November ...\nIn fact we heard the president himself over the weekend at those rallies galvanizing his supporters and saying you know if you want to preserve the uh the futures of of judges judge Brett Kavanaugh go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry\nOn the other hand you look we've got so many comments on our website I'm seeing your saying\nThat a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the cabinet nomination the women of the Senate block it or he is confirmed\nAnd the women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that is a comment on our website on

[laughter] ... some and thereby treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you're right I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there's even balance of power and and I still think we suffer from it that\nUh you know who works for you does it just never worked for the banks are you know or or did just that the banks the banks and the safety net the get FDIC Deposit Insurance and fed access and all that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fulfill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these so government support like Deposit Insurance can can incentivize a risk taking and too big to fail\nDisorderly doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power and he was in charge and it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't want to look like I was awake legs so uh you know I think that some of the told me they're afraid of me I don't know if that's a joke [laughter]\nI Can't I Can't\nBe little directed at times I Will be the first to admit that but I I Do think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge\nAnd well I mean I just I I'm I Am so the numbers of looking at them descendants written on a piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me\nNine trillion dollars an hour that Seventy percent of us financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected to feel that we had well\nIt it it is and what do we fix said I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously he and I have had our disagreements and in their policy just Remus but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need\nMore bailout tools and I think that's absolutely wrong system that's the system we still have that we don't want to say that system\nYou would like banks go down now\nOh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have a ... into the house and ate and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed\nTo you know put a bacon to a resolution process to break it up you know keep its bad assets out impose the losses on the shareholders in the end secured creditors which is where the lawsuit should be and where the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy\nTo fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the bank you know and and you're bringing new investors are new management\nTo an end in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process there are some ... unique things about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to you yeah\nThat's a tool we didn't have in two thousand eight we have now regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind the markets that this ... this is going to be the new paradigm this new process not bailouts would accountability\nWill suddenly you cast you know of so many questions you live there because I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist I'm not ... not I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis\nI mean the London and I don't think the banks are too big already won a breeder oh well\nUh there are people who have that view and I can understand that view and ah I I don't think there's a political will ah in Washington to do that I mean and this is bipartisan unfortunately you see\nLegislation going through now the reduced uh three the largest banks have reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed\nAnd in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress testing requirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say because I'm a Republican and I thought you know Republicans are market oriented\nA lot of Republicans trying to pressure the fed to reduce capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter]\nThat's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else in in my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThey finally happens but yeah I mean if they needed a bailout again I think our democracy cannot survive that and if they think\nToday then again she lived her I said I don't our democracy cannot survive another round of bailouts it just you can't look look at what happened you know people who discount the role of the two thousand eight crisis\nAnd and even you know the eight million homes lost nine million jobs lost you know that that the terrible hit to the public person still people struggling and lower middle income families um\nThat started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... in ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's into discontent we have right now so to suggest that we're going to bail out said yeah that that's going to be the new paradigm\nThanks for listening to Ninety eight point seven means I'm Danielle prior and I hope you're

answer around two thousand and why are they they're well to fight ISIS of course\nBut that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military is current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran\nSo listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five find this eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lives it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is ... rent for he is a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me All right so let me start\nWith you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by that we've got a link to it at on point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the prior to U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern scary in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded so the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged\nA Pentagon officials up to and including secretary of defense Mattis that\nUs troops are only fighting ISIS however they do play a secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country are\nBoth in kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us withdrawal is uh the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission\nOr and expanding of like the mission parameters that waste\nRight so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey just uh the state department special representative for Syria\nA following John Bolton comments said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission again until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers al Qaida and its affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq\nAnd so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that the way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria\nThey would try to quote it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as a secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... raise ... description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region\n[noise] well\nI think people in the thing that the price by the second coming out you can you learn that we've seen that yet because as you remember a few months ago um some check the chips are going to be going home family very soon and was actually an expectation that they would eat carts on by the end of the year\nAnd most of the regional palate all involved in Syria that she Russia Jackie\nI'm no everyone else in the neighborhood has been expecting he likes to go and they can practically to punish the ... the idea that that actually going to be getting any definitely definitely puts them back like\nIn ... when it comes to negotiate young and then you can share and more and I think it should be on the Web that she'll continue to eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more of from\nSupport for Ninety points in the news comes from Orlando Health Orlando
