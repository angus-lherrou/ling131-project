a writer and attorney over the weekend and my question is what to do about this broader ecosystem of hate that has been in Boulder and even legitimize in America in twenty eight teams where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that eight hundred for two three talk\nLet's listen to how a president Donald Trump himself reacted to what happened in Pittsburgh during a Saturday evening rally in Murfreesboro Illinois\nThe president began his speech addressing the shooting\nThis wicket act of mass murder is pure evil [noise] hard to believe and frankly something that is\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms

headlined the victims of the tree of life synagogue massacre are martyrs we have a link to that at one point radio dot or the rabbi rent and burg welcome to the program\nHigh magna your first thoughts today on um how ... how we should be looking at and thinking about what happened on Saturday at tree of life\nHey we need to be seeing it in context um when Trump is saying this is so hard to believe and I think this is absolutely\nDevastating a but it's absolutely conceivable get in the context of anti Semitism historically and on the rise in America given the context of our lack of protections for gun violence\nGet in the context of ongoing tree thing hate crimes in America and the rise of white supremacy\nI'm absolutely is\nUh [noise] if it sets it a lot of contacts and and I get in the piece that it offers sits in the context unfortunately of our history of of murders I in Judaism\nI should note here that we got a couple of comments that are coming online Nancy banks tells us on Facebook that while I Do not in any way wish to diminish the horror of the killings in Pittsburgh to black men were also murdered last week or possibly a hate crime a lot of heat for one week\nAnd in fact a genetics he's point that shooter was ... who had gone down the two black men in uh Kentucky said that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I'm trying to want to talk specifically about rising anti Semitism but also in the broader context of\nA as I keep calling it the ecosystem of hate here but but a rabbi written bird tell me a little bit more about um the you know how it is that we should look to or what exactly you see in American plead political leadership right now that maybe that maybe stoking all of this\nI there is a tremendous amount ... we have a at a white supremacist administration and Trump has been\nIn self attacking George Soros for a long long time he's been using even after the tree of life shooting he's been making use of the global asked what she does very very often both of these are\nNew contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles a the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and on the front and secretly ... you know funding infiltration is\nUh is is a very very very ancient idea um but it's it's manifesting now in a in a myriad of ways\nMm [noise] well I mean our firemen let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um that the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA was really ... ranting and raving about online I mean ah you know he talked a lot about uh his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest rate that that originally began and I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading\nOrganization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees and talk and then there was a conspiracy behind that as well so hard just to talk to me more about about how all those threats come together\nWell or this isn't the story just about the Jews are just about the tree of life a synagogue or where I basically grew up [noise] if you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine of social\nAnd political uh disarray and and and and break down and and I think you need to look at it in that context of\nThe first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston were quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers or this case in a church I'm fed by a lot of the same\nParanoia and and anger and and and\nConspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I look at it uh over the course of history ah conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a convenient and deadly a answer easy answer for uh\nPeople who are disengaged and an angry\nAt the system uh it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years\nAnd here in America is part of a medley of hate or that we're seeing across the spectrum\nOr we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia and and the language has gotten a harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the\nSome of the language that the the Democrats have used to have to lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is or who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\n... the point we've reached here\nAnd there are a lot of reasons for it there are lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically or is this subhuman is not quite human is is an other with a capital oh that is\nDangerous in in comprehensible and out to destroy society uh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system\nWanted contention but they relied on the idea that there would be character and the people that there were to be communities communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with them politically\nAnd and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing out of our civic culture\nIs what's allowed this to happen it's what's allowed\nOf the shooting in Charleston to happen it's it's what's allowed people to send pipe bombs to democratic leaders which is what led a Mr ... hours to\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from a carbon\nHide offering

ecosystem of hate and what to do about it and joined today by David Friedman Howard Simon and rabbi Daniel written bird and rubber ... just before the break we had that color a shalom who was taking issue with some things that you had said and I wanted to give you a chance to respond\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law ... son\nIn law is ridiculous it's like saying\nThat he couldn't possibly be in a Sachin is because he's had three lives it's some it's different with her right the idea of it that he somehow you know all dissolved of his white supremacist stoking up his blaming the the caravan on Soros\nOf his constant attacks on source calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally\nUm that he uses the word globalized again and again and again but somehow he's auto magically freed from from connection because of his daughters decisions to not resonate with me the idea that George Soros\nIs somehow this um you know is involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked and SARS himself\nAddressed it in an interview it's not even a fourteen year old in Hungary ah when the Nazis were there um\nAnd yeah I I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump mindset I Will say that very clearly the Torah commands us again and again and again to protect\nThe stranger who is among off the vulnerable and their commended thirty six times more than any other myths that in the Torah to protect the stranger because we were ...\nNon citizen or the immigrant among us and I I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those I to pay to paint us as I'm having some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are just part of a larger like right\nOut of ... ... yeah it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I I definitely want to return the ... but I also just wanted to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because\nI I Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know I I I take the point that there are lots of bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront had on this ecosystem that is being um if not\nBurdened at least a I don't I don't know legitimize or not to tamp down by a Republican leadership in America right now can I speak to that because I've been covering them for years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo our or to to to take it ... through the eyes of show long list like him for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best for the Jews overhead\nIs utterly wrong or and here's the reason for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states\nOr we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth in what's best in us to be not only president but but evident\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one is written out of the story on the theory that they're not human\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from

our don't you'd like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and and propaganda but the truth is that he rose to power on fear\nThe rose to power on fear of

all these things politically and that's the moment that were in\nMiami so she has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president of the United states has the most powerful a and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet\nWarning or that three\nWealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quit buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August\nAfter visiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties\nTo Nazis you know talking about uh that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anti immigration stances um and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the is just party were in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republicans\nAnd we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that soars may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protesting against\nJudge Kavanaugh silly all of these are actually see justice Kavanaugh now but all of these things together to me seems to be I don't know it it it just you know political cynicism of using these conspiracy theories some of it is true belief\nBut that this is this ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be an outcome of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case uh Howard let me just turn back to you and what do we do about it I mean we even have\nLou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYou know I heard that comment about this or is occupied State Department\nI think the only answer is leadership is voting as David Was saying uh with uh people have to get out in the in in an express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to an individual search being driven by individual voting\nIt also has to be leaders we have a paradox school system here in the sense that it's of the people by other people for the people are as from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character\nAnd and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it from from somebody ah from people who come forward as leaders to to\nExplain that America is a community and uh we're individuals and we'd prize individual ism in America but we're also community and we can't operate without that\nSo it's going to take leaders to come forward to to convince Americans as a whole that there is an answer to using fear and hatred is a way to gain power uh there's there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nSeveral states for a look at ... and what's driving voters to the polls that's coming up next our mom point you\nIt's been a full two years since we first tried are less intrusive style of fundraising call the soil and drive and this is how we do it now WM iffy family show your support for I'm interrupted programming by donating a dollar a day does it W.

M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nWhat about what I think is interesting about the house in the Senate maps going back to the two Americas as up there's actually not a ton of overlap between the competitive U.S House races\nAnd uh in the Senate map Florida is Florida is one of the exceptions to that were there or at least a handful of competitive house races but elsewhere you know the the pockets of play the places where Democrats can make big house getting such as um New York and California I mean they have gubernatorial race was but they're not particularly competitive\nI see well let's take a quick call here and Gary is calling from Clarkson Michigan get you're on the air\nFor having me on right now I think you are a panel for taking time from each day and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what trap for Donald Trump in twenty sixteen and\nYou know I ... one of the counties that Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to know one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be\nThis consensus of white is Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously the heavy manufacturing state\nThis is a state that kinda gone through with a lot of the deregulation that Donald Trump had gone through with the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so just as a progressive guy who was an office there but I Want to ask you this question and in terms of\nYou know what does potentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a blue wave coming in or what the impact and what that we've done the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party and Michigan twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that went over a there's a proposal ballot ear that will potentially\nUm you know changed the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats I guess in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very\nPerplexing yeah which you know not many people seem to talk about when it comes to a battleground state\nGarrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing in twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there's one state of consequences that seems poised to have a blue late it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which ... ... seems to have a pretty sizable\nUm casual lead in the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as and the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is margin it it was such a narrow margin ahead it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm\nUp against President Trump than twenty twenty\nYeah and then as Garrett was asking uh it seems the question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are we going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy and the next two years now that might that have an impact on a ... on on Michigan on on Michigan in Michigan\nWorkers well it depends a lot on what happens with the parents that he proposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertainty and he alternates between\nA talking about imposing more ... more terrorists on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump in his policy that safe to say it's a kind of don't know what's next\nFor or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think if it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of if something's not working you can just turn to do one eighty into All right we're going to we're going to do something else and\nWhen it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty race in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and what does the contrast\nBetween approaches and styles and and their view on the economy as well as how people feel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that\nRight you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races a happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling show how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there is also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counting by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election\nDay okay so this is then one of the reasons why\nI'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become a such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned brand campus the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from last Tuesday's given to toil debate in\nAtlanta uh first of all we are going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a route feuding uh Brian ... statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rules\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot she raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of voter suppression feed the narrative because that hurts oppression and only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidate ... state Brian Kemp said that he has a quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nThis is Ninety point seven news I'm Nicole Darden crashed and taking a look at your forecast mostly clear skies throughout the evening with no showers expected\nOvernight
