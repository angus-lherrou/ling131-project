spread out throughout society and unfortunately there were only two candidates that made it to the run off so I had to pick\nA between [noise] you know the work or the least worst when I was the option for many centuries with that I Am as a as a venue for or you know as a vehicle or to lead this nation\nIn Michael I just wanted to echo your point here is reading a you know for example I'm a quote in a in the Washington Post's from uh south Paolo dentist saying if there had been another decent candidate and he wouldn't have voted for a\nScenario that both knows a lot of garbage but quote he's the lesser of the evil thing exactly what you said there Michael but I got another comment here from the different listener Michael Gaskins says on Facebook to us\nWhy do people feel that they must give a green light to racism sexism homophobia an anti environmental isn't in order to fight crime and corruption both in our brains all of the above to say nothing of his fondness for state sponsored murder\nWhat's your response to this other listener Michael\nI come from an African Brazilian descent so you know from black\nGrandparents I have many gay friends that voted for both of them out of the uh feminism\nA quote unquote argument against us without you know there are so many I was just so many things that I have a path\nFor example when you're you mentioned that lady that I talked about that particular I figured I Would argue I guess she was defending the gentler that'd be headed and rape that girl you live it against that situation so he was he was he was so limited\nThat a woman was not sending another fellow woman that was raped and be headed that at\nThe level of conversation that he has to go against up in Brazil yeah you're looking at people that go to jail they go to jail get these things that will get capital punishment here in the U.S they'll go to jail they'll surf I don't know three four years and then they'll leave right\nIs this a young that young lady that killed her parents uh she was able to get out of jail for a for a Mother's Day walk\nMichael thank you for your call your passion there and I want to hear Larry diamonds response to that uh Larry Diamond Michael very clearly saying that the problems in Brazil so overwhelming that\nBoth the ... distasteful parts and he may not approve of in both narrow fall by the wayside well\nI think it's great to Michael called them because we now have a direct expression\nOf the frustration and anger that produced the victory for this extreme right and I'd say surely exclusively authoritarian candidate\nAnd the problem is that when you as a voter a turn to feel that you have little choice but to turn to such a blunt and Savage instrument as someone who has been so explicitly authoritarian and has expressed over\nThe entire quarter century trajectory of his political career such frequent contempt for democracy\nYou're putting the whole democratic system you know on the operating table\nAnd we need to keep something in mind magna uh when we look at what's going on in the world now but also\nThe history of democratic failure in the world frequently when you put in office they know failing or miss performing democratic system someone who has been\nAbundantly clear about is authoritarian intentions he acts on them and I'd say Brazilian democracy is a severe risk right now\nI'm I'm going to play a little tape that may or support exactly the point that you're saying a diamond this takes us to the Philippines with President Rodrigo do ... their\n... who was it has been very outspoken about his crackdown on drugs and violence there or to the point where you know he advocates extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and twenty sixteen he actually compared himself\nFavorably to Adolf Hitler saying that he would like to kill millions of drug dealers\nMuscles are the millions you know this is the meal that I'd be happy to snow\nAt Philippine president Rodrigo detail taste saying Hitler massacred three million Jews now there is three million drug dealers I'd be happy to slaughter them\nA long time and I said we've got some comments coming here from listeners I'm wonder you know you said that democracy may be on the end up on the operating table in these countries but Sean Megan says I think more than a little tongue in cheek he says I'm outraged that citizens of the foreign country can vote their free will\nAnd someone calling themselves ... said is it really a pushback on democracy if the strong man in question if democratically elected in legitimate election what do you think but\nI'd say a few things I'm number one a detour to actually has presided over the extrajudicial killing of well over twelve thousand people on the streets of the Philippines\nSo um when autocrats signal their intentions are we we have to take them seriously\nSecondly although there is rising\nDespair and cynicism about democracy and Brazil\nThere is not a majority sentiment to end democracy in Brazil and that is certainly not what Brazilian voters want I don't think it is what our previous caller Michael wanted they just want decisive action\nTo reform and cleans the system so you can say yes they voted for change they certainly did\nThey voted for what they perceived to be\nIn the runoff election the only option for real change that they had but that doesn't give both in our license to close down the Congress to close down the Supreme Court as his son who is also a congressman suggested they might have to do or to violate civil liberties\nAnd I think Brazilians now need to be very organized and very vigilant\nUh as we should be a from the international community and ensuring that both ... addresses Brazil's problems in a way but don't violate the constitution and the rule of law\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] the board for on point comes from W.

M. S. it's been a full two years since we first tried this less intrusive style the fundraising called fire with Dr and how we do it now that I'm happy family\nDo you support all uninterrupted programming but donating a dollar a day W. M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOr a psychologist so I'm interested in human nature and the nature of children [noise]\nLook at the little kids have you ever seen a little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious playful and eagerly doing things they're exploring the world almost from the moment they're born there looking around what's out there with new what can I learn about [noise]\nThink of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school\nAnd this is not this is not just some children that learn that this is essentially all the children they learned their native language from scratch\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them\nSo I'm schooling is that what if we just left them continue to do that instead of putting them away where their own questions don't count anymore where their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another to cooperate people talk about socialization being missing if you're not going to school or what kinds of socialization truly is occurring there [noise]\nSo we send them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because we've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity play for them that they have the ability to something here\nFor a second I thought I had read that quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where how did you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some I don't know some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a ... okay I tried to get them to change that [laughter] and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete mess quote\nOne of my own research has shown that children learn to read with out direct instruction when they are allowed to learn to read in their own ways at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of structure had\nA I have yet to see a child who's been in self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read a very different ages right\nWell here's what I'm asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might well it might fulfilled them or it isn't the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if a kid doesn't\nWe can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like civic or how government works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh\nYou know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world aren't we sort of setting them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know ... if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning a car they learning in in a way that is meaningful to that stays with them so let's take civics for example\nSo in schools we deprive children of all their civil rights\nLiterally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about physics is that real civics lots of or is it better civics lesson to say\nHey you're growing up in a democracy you're growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own lives you are also responsible for other people\nYou you are also free to choose your own path and happiness isn't that a better civics lessons [laughter] than a lecture on it you are living it\nYou are limited in what in what you know that that you'll have ultimate the total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nBut you know something yes we do have to live in a society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society\nThey are learning how to live in a society and it's also not the case that there nobody has totally free nobody can do things that break the law\nYou know there are many many students who are in self directed education are going to learning centers or school years learning stuff and they make rules they make the rules democratic way there are lots of rules you can't let her you can't if you take out toys you have to put them away\nYou can't there are rules against bowling and so forth but they're democratically made rules\nAnd isn't that a better civics lesson\nMoly ... been patiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps where we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subjects to children if they're totally self directed\nWell for me I I question what the word introduced me for in in this context because introducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective there there's an indoctrination that comes from that\nAnd for me as a self directed in an schooling parent we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on so\nThe idea that these things will not be introduced or seen or felt is something that I don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics\nAt its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready\nAnd whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happens at the playground or there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that it's not something that is specific to\nGoing to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere so my daughters are huge into making sure that their identity is affirmed everywhere that they go and they also participate and actions\nYou are listening to Ninety point seven news I'm Nicole darkening crashed and and your

I mean isn't that\nA lot but that was your ... your child will have a job and the reason your child will have a job is because your child has learned to take control of his or her own life my what my research shows is that the graduate so self directed education are doing very well in adult life there and not having difficulty getting jobs\nLet me get a response you Michael Apple what do you think\nOh first START I appreciate what's been said but I Want to ask one of the characteristics of the children of apparent he drew you really want to society in which we should um the children are simply the property of their parents\nWhen there's a growing movement in the United states for instance of anti Semitism of anti um you know clearly racist trying to change\nAnd I don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because the parents\nHave an ethical responsibility to be the best thing for their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now and ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticizing situations\nOf after that we're putting parents sort of up to my first my first response fucking does um we have to ask\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of my viewpoint having W.
