M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nFive now I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there you're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas in two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it\nAnd she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for her supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor and got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't accept your doctor's no because we have water I see because you have the water fountains available to you\nI was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of having this big deal and they read and scrutinizing my doctor I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested and listened to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you'd have to go\nThat's Heather Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen\nNow just because silver Greenberg and Natalie ... uh in the course of your reporting how did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you've found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt a big had experience in the workplace while they were pregnant\nSo I think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common this experience was\nWhen you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the way that me to have and we were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of very similar experiences from women all the way up and down the economic ladder and blue collar jobs in low wage jobs in office jobs for this most recent story and miscarriage\nI can say that ah we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis together um\nAnd uh we had\nTo in many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal and devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us\nYeah and and I imagine that the extreme difficulty that the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to that they're extreme difficulty with compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nThe freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were there ... yeah exactly um so it was a paycheck and I was also health insurance and again just and I talk to people who were still working at the warehouse so these are folks who\nAre at again\nGreat personal risk coming forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job right\nNow I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that uh the the warehouse company that use that many of these women or all the women in their major second story most of them that where they work\nDid the company not also said that the dispute the allegations because of uh currently their their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\nYes they they did say that they said that um they said they believe that these allegations were\nManufactured drummed out than exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is currently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points to kind of mentioned yeah\nNone of so with the exception of one woman I'm Tasha\nMorale who ultimately left the warehouse on and has become an an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women\nAffiliated with the union at all so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all\nAnd you have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing to the Teamsters in a broader context which is they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so we and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm\nA pretty basic set of disputed facts so for instance when he describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story as ... and window is\nThey ... the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows it has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't usually see sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nRight there are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that does exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement\nI think you need and the credibility of denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than say\nYou know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on the floor\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now and there's an interior window I can see out into the hallway of our radio station but\nYes I I'm In a similar studio I can also see hot into a into a room okay man is working\nSo you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the legal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here and just a minute with both of you Jessica ... but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their stories and if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma join a year on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first by and um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't\nWell I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as it I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing was it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories as well as all my other things and all these other men were just sitting there and what I thought were like at least co workers like a friend

an endless red available on apple potash [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate body we're talking about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace today and the New York times recently had a special investigative series on this topic it was reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and Natalie ... joined us today\nFrom New York I'm also joined by Joan Williams she's a professor of law at the University of California Hastings and director of the center for work life law\nThere and let's go to the to the phones once again and take a ... who's calling from Fort Mill South Carolina we you're on the air\nI I figured I could be the same token male I was a nurse or Fifteen Years working in a profession that is only three to four percent male bonding with three other people that you've had speak each one of them on our beyond accommodation\nWhich for all of a disability he however temporary\nTo a plea for preferential treatment and on specifically talking about one of the ladies\nWho mentioned that people didn't understand she had children and that they assigned her shift that could have been assigned to the child was the single but that they didn't accommodate that she had children\nThat goes way beyond any workplace accommodation I was also a paralegal for a decade going workers' comp and\nThere there's a lot of requests for understanding in a situation in which accommodating\nPhysical disability which is simply simplifies march or getting pregnant\nIs I've stood on fours and watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're having morning sickness or accommodating some you know hey they're going to come get me when I was a male last like pick somebody up didn't matter just because she weighs ... pounds\nShe can't lift like I Can't get to some of those are simple mhm when you start moving into it you shouldn't have to work nights go pick on the single people don't have children that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nYeah Lee I I sure you actually in the end I Want to turn your uh called back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um and Joe Millionaire turns to you but at least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr give me a second you just have to south right because I think it was the last time or one of the more recent times that uh that we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace so this is when a a UPS driver Peggy young doctors that she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because it put at risk of miscarriage\nSo she was told to stay home a meaning she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case went all the way just up to the Supreme Court and in a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy and described what happened\nSo I went to the doctor I had it with my ... and I turned out and and basically they said you know we don't provide light day for paying I have a home and tell you how long they're pregnant\nI should say in two thousand Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but generally is my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent\nIn that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr some really interesting to see that and I think Lee's call echoes a lot of what justice ... had back then he he wrote for example that prohibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others have similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favorite employees\nThen he gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors they would have to offer to first pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age\nThe bar for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health is dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals ten emergency rooms ten urgent care location in forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nAnd here alone creates a guarantee of seabird treatment what do you think about that\nUm well that's not true I'm Lee does have a good point on it's not illegal but it's very bad practice um two Everytime you have an undesirable shift give it to somebody who's single who doesn't have or doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers\nOn and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes needs to take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because it pregnancies needs to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers to accommodate the person with diabetes often don't accommodate the person I'm with a with the pregnancy\nAnd blue collar contacts and I think about what Joanna said she said we can do the work I remember reading of one woman thing uh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what Joanna saying\nI'm that often and blue collar contexts women can do the work but the employer my sense and reading hundreds of these cases\nIs um the employer didn't want to hire these ... and the first place and so I figure it's great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on leave and fire them and that's what the young versus UPS decision a began to put an end to\n... know Jessica silver Greenberg and not only to truth how there there have been attempts though since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgraded modernization of uh laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers fairness at you know and that's been a kind of centerpiece uh um efforts to strengthen the federal law and filling the gaps that the that exist in the pregnancy discrimination that\nThere is an effort since so every congressional sessions and twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced to the pregnant workers Fairness Act\nSo far it has not made it out of committee so it has not made it out of the help committee which stands for health than labor and pensions I'm not going to get ... terms right but um it's never had a hearing and um\nHe has bipartisan support it now has bipartisan support I'm kind of not ironically but interestingly the chairman of that committee Lamar Alexander\nI'm his home state is um where ex Tio or where that XP are warehouses made in Tennessee\nAnd and so you but you're saying that it hasn't actually sort of advance to any ... you'd have never even advance to a voter debate\nIt's never been put on the floor and knowledge you're right it's never it's never had a a hearing\nOkay so Joan Williams let me just hop back to you here I mean is what you see uh in in in this proposal even if it's not going anywhere in Congress yet is it taking on the right direction\nIt's taken us in the right direction and in fact something like twenty two states already have similar provisions there should be a national law that says\nUm workers are sometimes women women sometimes get pregnant and you have to accommodate them when they do on the other hand I think it's really important to recognize that pregnant women already do has sweeping rights and they actually have rights even if the employer has accommodated nobody else\nI'm potentially under the Americans with Disabilities Act so any pregnant worker who was in a situation like those described in the article or listening\nOn please go to pregnant at work to to ensure that you can exercise the legal rights that you have because pregnant workers already have a lot of rights under existing law\nSupport for Ninety seven news comes on the lake wheels museum

N. F. though\nYou say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons inflate the threat is by some justification for why you need even more\nThan a thousands of nuclear weapons are already have and in this case the Baltimore is pulling out an old trek he's he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with ideological grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the Russians who are modified and existing weapon to give a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites in European Russia and apparently in one of the site we're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we'd been detecting this was about twenty fourteen\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently and arms control treaty their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't like repeal the burglary laws you enforce them\nBy repealing this treaty you're allowing putting to do whatever you want now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want in Europe and here's the there is a really bad part it's unlikely that we can match it\nOf course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country to watch them but no European ally wants them yes why you're seeing how of complaint\nFrom France from from Germany from the European Union who warn that you're taking down and these are their words a pillar of European security\nNo one needs a new arms race does the foreign minister of the European Union are among among others that's what they're afraid of that Trump is fighting an arms race that was already brewing as both the U.S and Russia built in other nuclear arms and now they're afraid that Europe uh once again be the battle ground\nFor these two nuclear giants Disney battle\nRight I mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's discomfort with the possibility of an end to the INS treaty I mean I'm seeing here this big march Gabriel who just stepped down in March as German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear madness I mean we should recall that in ... at one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry and Europe which is one of the things that led to a the the INS to begin with that just hurts you and I knew he had a lot more to say but I Want to welcome in one more\nUh ... voice into this conversation Evelyn focus joins us now she joined us today from Washington She's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative Eurasia center and the ...

Virginia Margaret you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call I find the whole idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear a\nTrainee buying and a logical to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons just going to make the world safer we already have more than seven thousand new believe\nAnd I don't see how the idea of increasing that number is going to make the world and they say are we have enough to destroy the world many times over all ready it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call Evelyn how would you like to respond to Margaret\nUm well first to um cow than if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be from with our adversaries and\nI guess my thinking with regard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now give the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt but that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and\nFor Ninety point that the news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nPoint of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy a which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother show on that and\nJust during the only way to turn back to you here because of course uh we we could also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we we will return to it but China has been lurking here uh a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the I N F here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... were that the U.S has constrained by the ins and not able to deploy strategic weaponry in the in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier because of this and that that's putting us to counter the term behind the eight ball in Asia\nRight you always have to be very careful when you hear people who are in want new nuclear weapons in the language they use so John Bolton says you're not going out outmoded treaty violation ignored\nWere constrained and so you know it feeds into that feeling that we're being with US Soccer and the other countries are stealing a march on us or as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nThat is about a several hundred times more weapons and you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into the trap\nOf nuclear war planters planners who who see this as some kind of board game where you have to match piece for peace so on China what\nThey're talking about is that China a land power doesn't have much of a navy doesn't have much of a an air force that can reach beyond us borders they have new for now [laughter] okay for now\nThey they they have a nuclear weapons are up about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to our seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like real like one\nOr anything like the United states and about forty to reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those ... we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us from building those but we have see based missiles are hungry to injure\nAre based weapons back and watch them fought just fine we have strategic submarines proud the oceans and which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons\nFor ... that can hit bam for every one they have their can hit us we don't need to match 'em and here's the other off underlying realities there's ... there's nobody you know one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said that\nThey do not want us to part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match a weapon\nWell everyone focus a ... I think the the deeper one of the deepest points that Joe is making here uh it's worthy of of some of this discussion here further discussion because in and I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to just point that what there is no need for land based I'm intermediate range missiles when we have such a a overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use no\nOne wants us to use them but that that are there for a for us to achieve purposes in the Asia theater\nWell I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planner so I it's a little bit out of my", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "25"}
