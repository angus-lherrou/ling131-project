V. E. okay\nWell you obviously cannot do that you cannot and birthright citizenship but an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives\nYou know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [laughter]\nUm and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here which is on track to illegal immigration\nThat's how speaker ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. V. okay in Kentucky\nOr just yesterday will join us now is Ellen go ... he's joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on point radio dot org as well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program thanks for having me All right so you just heard that Paul Ryan they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is\nThis route issue unchecked illegal immigration\nAnd you know today this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets are about to immigration specifically so how central is this as an issue\nTo Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue um it's it's started from Trump hum he obviously this was something that worked for him in twenty sixteen wrote into the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he was talking about Mexicans and\nWhich Mexicans are coming into the country and all that and he wrote that through to the White House and so for him he's just taking a page out of his twenty six themed political playbook\nAnd applying it to this mid term um and it's and it seems like something that just kind of struck him just a few weeks ago because it was really this carbon that really started at all since October sixteen I'm is running really started to you know the you know there's such has been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America during the tear up the new NAFTA deal throwing the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at the at this point and it's still about nine hundred miles away [noise] um so he started but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embrace that um and they've been arguing the same time they've been taking the same tax\nUh for for weeks now and you see it and Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um if not the defining issue of their campaign\nAnd how much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and healthcare last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing about immigration I'm with Republicans talking about it on the campaign trail\nWell this has been the fascinating thing to see if you pull all Americans um\nNumber one is health care and number two jobs in the economy a gun policy is number three immigration is fourth and this according to a Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolated out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue them so clearly it's working for\nThe target audience that they're intending to um you know immigration has all rolled up the ... one of the things that really riled up his base in twenty sixteen\nAnd so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about in record numbers of them have been ... and when it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that\nThis is an attempt and this is a way to rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no working on the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this is strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... and ... their turn out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist year because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes Democratic Party because it's so simple way of illegal and legal ... migration and the president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years we've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it\nAnd it just seems kind of crazy we well I don't think the big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that you obviously wants to change birthright citizenship\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from the

reporter\nFor the Texas Tribune and it's got lots of listeners comment coming ... here on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people in town and Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tones\nAnd then mark says the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I I just wanted to say that I Am totally in favor of trips to the border they\nCan I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump does not want any violence down there but it's obvious that\nPeople are getting aid somewhere they have water bottles they have they have money something sponsoring this and we need to protect America\nAnd also on a I don't know I Believe in voter ID I helped me get once you get a library card I have to have identification could get a loan\nTo open a credit card to get a library card just starting to kill it is there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it why can't they have I mean ... vote\nWill Lorrie thank you so much for your call their uh Alan Gomez I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who ... immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concern the issue they're concerned about [noise]\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned the idea that you as one by one said that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president in from other Republicans who have been warning about this care of it\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these caravans are like I mean first off they're coming into the ... there they they travel in ... ranch for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America Mexico is a very dangerous in Denver\nUm so they force art for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely and the last ... care of and I got here I think\nProvides a little bit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border um about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them\nDid exactly what they said they they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um and and promote more reporters that we have embedded with the Caribbean moving through Mexico\nUm the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here um it it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred and again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee\nSo it's going to take a long time and by the time they get here it's going to be for fewer people than not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or take over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm Alan ... a little early in the show and then just clarify here a bit but aren't isn't the Trump Administration also seeking to some merely deny asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat is a no no the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh mid ... they were planning the Tuesday rollout of this but things have pushed back because of the Pittsburgh\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from our land out how to do whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six ... ... ... more information is that she's now health dot com\nIs to implement the travel ban shortly after Trump took office it was the first two versions of the travel ban worship down by the courts but the third one survived and so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one in trying to apply somewhat similar argument\nTo what's going on along the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nAnd does the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second one he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could grow out here\nRight now who in ... oh you know you're there in El Paso when I was I mean if you could talk to us about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one a week between ... representative\nA Republican we'll heard and Gina Ortiz Jones or his Democratic challenger right because they did that district that heard represents has many hundreds of miles up on the border\nTo correct It's got about eight hundred miles of the Texas Mexico border and it stretches from a ... county\nUh all the way to uh to be altered their county um which is includes San Antonio and big band and several border counties in between the you know this this this was considered a closer it's a few months to go out of it but the latest polling shows that um\nCongressman or it is I guess he's a little bit more comfortable if I have to say that then is um or tissue on doesn't pose a significant a challenge and could still you know that that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back to twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving\nThe Democrats and and the protects us a little bit of hope but a congressman heard also and it was very public about his is the way he strives for bipartisanship um you know she and and partially work actually they you know they did that\nFacebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they have the drive back to to be seeing the they ended up in the Facebook Live up their journey which I think when I'm pretty good way for\nFor both of the Congress rent to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas they're concerned about the wall and imminent domain and issues like port security but they are also um but by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they think it's an action you know you talk to [noise]\nTo ranchers along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans are they have to call border patrol or people are going to their property that's up there not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work or to escape\nYou know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman hurt in the minds of his constituents has done a pretty good job of trying to strike a middle down she's been somewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but\nCloser to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more towards the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the extreme and um and to to Mr Mr Gomez is point earlier with respect to the to the care of and\nUh he's absolutely right with respect that we don't know how many people are gonna end up coming here and what I saw on the Britain widest on Tuesday was migrants there were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get processed so\nWith respect to for the call these concerns in illegitimate concerned about who's coming into the country if you're a violent criminal lawyers can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're going to present at the port of entry when he was a lot of people are definitely\nDoing you know the the herd Jones raises interesting to me because uh will hurt has been I think he he represents as the as you were saying earlier how um the views of communities on the border I'm much more they're more subtle and textured\nThan we might see it a ... as we get further and further away actually from from the border because I Know hurting didn't have very eloquent um advocate for more smart well technology versus hard wall high technology between the United states and Mexico but we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Alan\n... thanks for taking the call uh I I think this is just another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense\nUm and to play defense against emotional appeals and stayed focused on this rational discussion or um I think there's a lot of winning

eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk what is your question for America's most preeminent a costume designer who was telling the visual stories of African Americans on film through the fabric\nThat she put her actors and actresses and again we're at eight hundred forty three eight to five five a routine Carter let me ask you can just jump back in time deep back in time here because I\nRead a in a previous interview that you gave that um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on sort of how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume design is that right\nYes um when I was a younger uh say junior high school and through high school my mom worked for the city she was a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker it was a free counseling service for the city and\nPeople could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew people you know um there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and\nSo we would ride with her do um you know downtown or down go to ... she'd drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh in point or hide you know high in the back seat\nAnd my mom would say you know he looks okay he's gotta clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause and it's kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know sometimes she would even role that window down to our dismay and\nSay you know how ... how George you know how are you today\nAnd you know that kind of a view of\nYou know people is what I still used today to kind of embrace a individuality and that it helps with embracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all in\nYeah you know 'cause some occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly occurred to me you know to go but but ... ... on a day to day basis\nIn the real world what we wear is a deliberate\nChoice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the world of who we are and when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film\nThat's essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story or and so now they want to communicate that to the world's constructed in that film and then to us as the viewers\nYes I feel that costume design or can be just to find it storytelling design and you when people want to associate costume design with fashion and you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but the\nOverall a I'm a goal\nIs to tell the story to work within a larger story or the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear right\nSo so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm ... in Hollywood I mean well let me just ask me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done what Fifteen plus collaborations with him and\nYes I have it ... it it goes by fast\nUm I met Spike Lee in Los Angeles a friend who's a casting director now Ravi read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for and it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of my friends\nAnd I I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all you know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and\nI really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so I kept you know modeling around in my I have this idea of getting film experience and he suggested that I call USC\nOr UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student thesis project he said that would give me experience with being on a set and what that medium um would be like yeah\nAnd so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was on a U.S see students ... are doing the costumes\nWell and then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right\nThing so I Want to play a clip on that day I was actually the first one and then do the right then do I say OK I wouldn't be held a Spike Lee fans out there like get your film ... right right [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing it's such an amazing movies this day so I wouldn't want to play a
