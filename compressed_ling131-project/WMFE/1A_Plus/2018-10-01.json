question there for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired in Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court at administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party and often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but\nI think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed he is a successful justice well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas\nFrankly a is today if you ask the justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so and Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt\nLast year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nLooked at another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drove the presidents of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law firm ... think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walk I'm afraid to even if you let me start with the question that I began with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony as we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh but how well that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nBut I think you know harkening back to what the caller a just a year you're I'm listening or just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw on judge Kavanaugh's opening censoring the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her requests for an identity you\nKnow I think that ah whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have tried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear a request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leach get anyway and disregarded her request that Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to\nMake this part of a political gain gain like she\nCame up with this decades long come on to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to her and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault\nAnd have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there\nHave emailed the Democrats are showing their ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but that would require morals which they lack\nOne age continues next hour or

a bill that would have expanded that states red flag law Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats given array of ways so\nThis is an unprecedented in terms of getting vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm Jerry Brown has a governed as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]\nUh you know in this case he felt like it perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh it went a little too too far um and a return and it's a question of of ballots but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland test focused on a these so called red flag laws or I'm a limiting the gun access to guns for people a

is their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more uh controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the ... are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general for this policy would allow family members for\nLaw enforcement to

Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that his a minus rating from the n._r._a. drops to a seat as a result of a huge support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan\nActually there eh eh he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician and he has to be aware that that has an impact on his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady gets them as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that as part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that have been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country\nA vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and de balance appropriately or the you know the second Amendment rights says of gun owners\nWest at the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job is getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning sank the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions say certainly applaud governor Hogan for doing the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nMy sure you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when\nIt comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April Vermont's governor Phil Scott who was a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nThere were Scott says he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled an alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically

with Richard Feldman Chris Brown and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who said will leave out who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WBFO our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think was burned out on was the fact that you have an Eighteen year old who did purchase this weapon I think I think without that particular fact you probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom are gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being\nFor one particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in them off so if you have if you're a correctional officer\nFor sure if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not unfair that even at those ages\nThat state rep host the ... in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYes than our as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for a\nAnd R A for a long time um had as suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing I think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview\n'em and the app held and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm which schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws or the minimum age being one all of which were\nA really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw a from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in a home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bells ah reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me as it passed in the state of Florida rat has long been one of the\nStrongest a sort of ... of the ... legislative agenda and I think is a very telling\nOn obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to save storage and the moment but there were ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which a state representative who joined us showed us one of these safe storage lockers that does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org\nBefore we move on to other kinds of gun legislation Richard Feldman could I just get your sense in terms of\nThe n._r._a. real view on gun legislation being already has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just say the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that could be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ... and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first of all it's to find something I'm always a little bit of a loss tons of ...\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're committed to helping tell by the health care

pride\nAs so many will myself included um but I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership\nOf an already here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate that ah when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun\nThey're almost institutionally have to be against it because of the terminology and the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean that we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times\nBut you

environment\nOr any other hot button issues and America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in a firearm today than others but when we've been put on that side Scott worldwide is on his eyes I wanted to ah just ah to\nTo add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned in perhaps a we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a\nUm the gun lobby is such that ah that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm\nA there is another outlet in many states and that's about an issue of Washington state will have a ballot initiative a November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a
