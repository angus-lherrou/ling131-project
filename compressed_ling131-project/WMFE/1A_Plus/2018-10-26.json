that confirms their already set beliefs how do we break out of this show people that does you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter] I think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now\nOn the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between\nFor Ninety point have come some land out how to whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many athletes care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six out patient ... more information is that he's done I Know how that calm\nCulture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths\nOf these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we're talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believed to be important in life\nAnd what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever in what we believe that but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making the need is the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nBecause of because of my report I talk to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore that look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd usually and I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter those working for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but\nIf you hate NPR so much how do you know what we sat on one age to criticize it if you ate the Washington Post so much how do you know what was printed there to criticize it\nYeah and that quite frankly I think ah that that a behavior if exemplified most from the president himself who really hate CNN but it seems to watch a lot of it\nAnd and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging us who don't want us to do what it is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a need criticism or the media needs to be criticized so we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nWe're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of the story over the weekend ... please just remember the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of this story that had been clarified a walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this\nKeeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org ...\nA few more of your comments before we move on [noise]\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue believe match referring to the the congressional baseball game which Republican Congressman Steve ... of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male here's devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if this story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly let you know but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen [noise]\nThat wants frankly not care about our country so much [noise] and you know what we can\nGo and really we're not suppose that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nKnowing and neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationalist is just someone who put America First um but the reality is anyone with a is a historical context of nationalism knows that it is a worldview\nEmbraced on other rising uh that has led to um you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself a\nFrom a spaces that would give them rights that uh we we deem a central and important to human beings um and so Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the ... the term nationalist when we saw\nA Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because uh the ... the form of nationalism that was most a familiar with a band and in the bribe our community what that of white nationalism which we've seen um\nYou know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic\nTo see Trump embrace it I'm wild misrepresenting it put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam er UC I Love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is\nOn the use of the word nationalist versus say patriot particularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic give us to parse the words parcel language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a good group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird will die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth that is right in front of us\nHe [noise]\n\nHe continues next our body point seven news\nEntire family worked at the same auto plant in Michigan until it closed during the recession like Asian

state we're in\nOn one day\nLet's get back to the friday news roundup conversation with taffy Adam and Eugene using this is not the first time the Trump Administration has targeted the transgender community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the courts\nA reality start cheat when gender published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by age or just in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he was insulted our dignity this is politics at its worst unquote\nNow usually we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of conservatives are not very trans friendly but she appreciates that we used to being in the room and being able to talk to them about trans issues\nI also had to push back on her a little bit 'cause she knows that people in the room clearly do not want her there\nWhat do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just kept you know it's been really\nFascinating she uh is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by\nThe transgender rights community because uh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has been a fighting for ah the idea that she likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has tried to be at the table before her\nUm and and that the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps a for not being a a boat advocate of the transgender\nA community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that one of the things I most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different ah identity groups can listen to the same candidates and walk away with different things in general are loaded and that Washington Post op ed\nThat she backed Trump because she heard him\nInclude algae beat the community and has a speech at the Republican National convention and she saw people applauded so she thought he would have bad algae beats he writes\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it's just one of those amazing moments in about how different Americans here different banks\nWhen it gets to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sending in for sex centers routinely uses such on birth certificates it seems that we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nCook out take this one on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do with identity sexuality has to do with who use\nFor Ninety point at a news comes some Random House whatever whenever and wherever Orlando healthy dedicated to

be clear I think I misspoke earlier and said that the caravan is a possibility the care means real the troop plan is real it is possible that the care of and might not get to the border by way of misspoke when I brought that up\nBryan emailed is this column of potential immigrants really such a big deal it's not like they're trying to sneak in they're coming up to knock on doors to ask for help sounds like they're following our rules\nAnd tweeted can we please start calling the care of and what it is a group of refugees fleeing communities destroyed by two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S had a hand\nAlso on right now is lots of your commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there irrepressible youth tweeted a quote from George Orwell nationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump used the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American\nAnd Matthew tweeted amassed tweeted equating nationalism with white nationalism seems akin to the right rounding socialism up to styling this on both sides are talking past each other more and more and demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose new ten percent tax cuts for middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election\nKathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms or whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nThis out I hate to say that but I don't think he has a plan [laughter] I think that it is I'm playing to his base maybe trying to stand his base because the original tax cut that he promised\nI don't think it helped middle class people as was promised the first time so maybe this is an effort to do so it's an effort to get ... voters out for this election\nAnd I asked them how do you see it\nI I don't think that we should even be talking about it on a news program until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy there's everything about this is just so an serious I'm right now\nAnd I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit by even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four

President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruin was pointing out to apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also it is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping or countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOf their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives\nIn the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no greater testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with ... feet and come to the the the United states and settle\nAnd have children and have better lives extensively and and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump ... and I guess Republican rhetoric\nThat play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they or anything but and I also do want to point out a car ruined mentioned that President Trump\nAdmitted to the ... a A R mentioned that uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly he was using um Middle Eastern as a slower earth arts which which\nI Believe we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\nAnd that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation that but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of of Middle East and that's the um it is extremely dangerous because it it it eight then tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at\nAs Carlin was pointing out again a movement that happens very often or you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states and the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here and the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful\nWith language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments or to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug in Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the English language\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from the thirteenth a annual central Florida that's fast this Saturday October twenty seven at our land do festival park that's vegetarian festival we'll have food speakers cooking demonstrations live music artists animal rescues the kids on it and over two hundred vendors\nInformation available at ... dot org\nI'm Joshua Johnson the host of one egg become a sustaining member of W.

I mean let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message\nOf Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex\nWhich has been a phrase has been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex to the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nI thought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't say in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's bad because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the er the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both thought but I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not\nRegulation of some ... some farm is is on its way it's coming and so\nAt some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it was in the tail\nEnd and ... and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support is a of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's there's a new area law that protects\nThe privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the e you've if you've noticed written the last few months that a lot of the website you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nFeel it's more juicy under parliamentary privileged to name for reading of the individual in question given that the media for being subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of the story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron Hain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privileged to named billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nIs such a big deal it sounds like you it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between\nFree speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of it just ... ... in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is\nPretty unique tool you can say things in\nThat you can say outside and and not suffer and any libel actions and Peter hang was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThere's this guy a full of green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to bite Tony

bully ended was sexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course to sit in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details who can't get because of these nondisclosure agreements with at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nYou know moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and like when\nWe were doing it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British law how's your structure to say to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is a\n... and it's already been a question is can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually now I'm In player who's pulling things at ... for doing things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nI'm In front of able to get away with that it it kind of the perfect and ... and ... it's kind of perfect at ... I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of values protecting or is it the reputation everyday accused in this way where India is can be applied to newspapers that were never a party to them or is it getting us out in the public face and said he was like an extra level in the u._k. and determining you know how much of the\nNational or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how shall be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections what Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they had the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in this second round of voting\nFernando ... on the left ... is on the right in ... who's the lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondent for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nWell Booker has been a Congress night for a couple of decades now and I agree with the current owner or overcooked\nMiller like I say that there are more for ... ... ... and ... and ... and go on and ... even when they're\nVery provocative recognizing that a lot of people who come our own otherwise known as a status and an iconic maker acreage so", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "26"}
