himself\nNo thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure at hard you know for years decades um [noise]\nHad different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act\nUm that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had ... equal housing opportunity in their community and I'm\nVery proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson in the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a uh\nDepartment any point in the news comes from Eileen Dole health\nArena health network a pediatrician that committed to helping out by the health care partners dedicated to their well being sometimes can they all had quitting is all important teenage years later how positive or twenty pediatric locations parents central Florida family more information including locations that are Random House dot com slash kids\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is hug doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that it's not that it could do the mission that wants to blame people for being poor secretary been cardio which I completely disagree with I think they've taken them in the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also the ... work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bubble\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know that President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags folk to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty eighth paint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so\nIs impacting our markets and that's impacting our farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China are but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture as you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are are some of them okay what's the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do an degree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and the folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nUh you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it the completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives uh folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by\nA while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment with the leadership of of uh some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nUh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA one of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states as possible [noise]\nWe've seen uh some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of under other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics and warehousing\nI'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from a perspective of the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nYou know I I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town\nHow many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost\nI see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American light the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully\nCobble a life together when he said those folks in terms of the future of trade here\n[noise] uh what I say is that number one I'm you\nKnow we need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time uh we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a essentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities\nOne age continues next hour on Ninety point seven news\nAcross the country

pretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs in a ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am a representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection is doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the VP paid the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned at the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one way up there with the pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because\nOf that is consistently one of the big complaint so we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed last like this will\nBe these gangs are causes are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug price issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but ah\nAh that that will vie let federal legislation and the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggling to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these guy clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the you know the lowest price act of two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act\nAnd uh obviously based in the navy you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to\nA school the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have a lot of people didn't want to have that\nBut now we have it then it's going to really drive prices\nScott ... back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with

a formula that the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over
