A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA results\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares about hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working yeah I think when you engage with Trump to in some of the arguments that is what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans I'm sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nA way to go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio ... ah\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them try to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of took 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician that committed to tell them tell by the

information including locations that are Random House dot com slash kids\nOn a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff\nJosh will view of the way in which um you know the parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling that the guests so they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know our presidential runs from big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know story Dennis Miller Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've let people who've drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know ... up here losers are both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week you democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot or for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lying in bed on attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas\nUm it's been a major shift in tone for art but it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with\nJust yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat at the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nThey rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nMean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless they're the major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nI don't like Sunday of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAn undercover aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party overall the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance is running you know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over ark\nHas been able to keep them to single dead\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically ... that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do forever Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were on Monday and the results\nLooked pretty good for Democrats and house races or at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents\nThan six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars to corner\nIn the Senate Democrats are also outrage and Republicans Beto O'Rourke raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town in Mexico beach is not reported given any numbers um of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\n\nOne age continues next our body point seven news\nThe Affordable CARE Act is the central issue in Arizona and rain but the way voters perceives the law has changed we'll meet a mother who saw it as a lifesaver than a burden now chooses to go without insurance [noise] like I don't have a\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly healthcare in Arizona's midterms this afternoon on all things\nConsidered fermenting area\nStay listening this afternoon at for for all things considered here or not he point seven\nHi I'm Jeremy hops in up here and now W.

worrying uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales that included potential sanctions and many other things\nI Will say though I James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we have never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is on entangled\nBut I kind of take Sony has point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it well\nThis is the limit ... to me at that point Josh represents absolutely critical as you know someone who's been actually a very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in them paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all of US military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment with that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and in Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we never a threatened to sanction them over a bear as you over their funding of hottest and other extremists in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country\nUh any country in the region for their actions except for Iran\nWho has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that he may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you can totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of show gee but does not blame a ...\nA coach or Josh working are coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sweet to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence that the Turks now have\nThey have the photograph these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of\nOf the ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a follow guard somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they're going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes in the College of arts and humanities offering graduate and undergraduate degrees and

Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is\nDoing now compared to you know it being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether uh there's going to be any sort of shift in you know\nI'm sure that can is gonna be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether causes surgeon traffic accidents where the cost of search tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada yeah the\nCBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting that in this country marijuana is considered the\nMost illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there with heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have no currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd oh and who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIt possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint but I had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and see the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication [laughter] when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was is updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things tax the mind to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mass right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also James what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of openness whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization at a national level might meet for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nYou know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a controlled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprise when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and mirrors dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I think this was a trend that's happening all over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to remain when your tax marijuana", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Orlando", "day": "19"}
