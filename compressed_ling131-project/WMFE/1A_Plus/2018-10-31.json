M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nRadicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior errors so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nMick how do you see it\nAh there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout the the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exporting it to his political ah aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty percent identify as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level or he should be leading the discussion in a way that is more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is what is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a vial of a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera\nBut in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump\nI Wonder though Nick how much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but I think you know who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence ... those words weapons for sure and they led to a war\nAh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters\nBut also that we need you know what\nWhat are we going to do about that so I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how to how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nPeople I Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer ... a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term is a media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who have commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to de twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime and Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone address the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera they\nHave permeated our society and uh finally elected their leader which only embolden stump Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of a of a role various media outlets playing this\n... question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical big picture that and maybe but in from my answer here and in part of that is a reciprocal role that used to access between the president and the press\nAnd it used to be the case that and there was initially beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each had a press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured and that's largely due to and cable news and social media and the fact that we now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nAnd and so information circulating very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago and which is really fractured this relationship between the president President Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but at ten has really done much better for worse jot depending on your perspective\nAnd and so at Trump is completely mastered the news cycle\n\n\n\n[noise] he continues next hour on body point seven years hundreds of black women are running in federal state and local elections for\nBlack women have been the most reliably bowling constituency for many years for the Democratic\nAnd so this is about more than just respect their vote but it's about respect and

I Wonder\nHow you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment Jim that after answer and so Trump will say the same that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial and in these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign and a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge and what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julian ... and and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nAnd and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know this is on CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people right and he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are they are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what and the journalist Julie ... he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lie about me and and then two I'm accused at other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy\nAnd and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nAnd he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to cook week which is an appeal to piracy to say oh everybody else does is it's not just me\nAnd and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise] this is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens [noise]\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um and it meant that he in fact has\nWrong I Wonder how effective they are Jennifer it is in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this obsession\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of maybe point seven W.

John Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he's the composer on the twenty eight teams sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to\nThank you for having me you've been away from a Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nWhen his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason's bomb a talk to me and he said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nUh get aboard and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spring doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been was ceremony since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worse other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that you're right ah it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWhere were they at least understand let me think that uh\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's a venture and so forth and so on\nSo director of a horror movies think of it this way horror and comedy or a law like 'cause it's turning it's all about timing it's all about when things happen and how they unfold\nAnd it's more complex than than people assume but uh people just think that ... a lot of war and obvious violence and it's not\nYeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on ... or I Do not personally do well on blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that because that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think it takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie\nFor Ninety point haven't even gotten some land out how to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando healthy dedicated to providing many athletes care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten or ... ... ... ... ... ... more information is that he's done a new house dot com\nWell look to make it really simple\nUh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every\nAction think of it that way not a genre necessarily so that's a reaction to things\nAnd that is the story is is unfolding than you used the storytelling to a a a set up your scares and set up things they're frightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and feeling for him that's what it takes\nNow were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or was it something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nKnow as I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise]\nA virtuoso violin player and he hit taught the college level music courses at the university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old that I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violent to the piano and guitar and other things I picked a lotta stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a movie composers and classical musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did this seem to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he caught it on the I had a pair of bongo Saigon for Christmas so he taught me five forum that and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing side\nAdapted that time's signature gender piano piece there we'll\nWe're speaking to John ... the director of dozens of horror classics including probably some of your favorites Halloween to think Christine prince of darkness
