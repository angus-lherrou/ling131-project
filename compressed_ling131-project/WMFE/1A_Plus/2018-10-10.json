consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to a\n[noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council it is\nA group a debt is co founded by a white actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution is pushing for a carbon tax where all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the\nAh oil majors the largest car manufacturer in the United states largest utility but also the largest um solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke you to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker's shoulder carbon defense plan but Joshua let me clarify we have\nThere is a separate spin off organization that is a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon okay and they just connected to the organization or\nUse it as a spin off but it's still a connection in any way or completely separate\nUh it is a separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader trend lot and uh\nUh sooner bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests curled\nUp before let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax\nShores so um [noise]\nThe idea of a carbon tax is um and each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price\nOn how much economic harm it causes um and at ... and I ... and important new on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house\nHe's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday\nOr the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work um so he came up with the idea of\nEvery kind of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurts a the global economy on and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time\nUm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost at once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are ... can essentially um create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon\nFor Ninety planes at a news

have just paid old billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest for farmers and greatest noses to ever uh existence and thrive\nIn Hollywood as far as the coming up the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry as the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing is placed in time where there's a movie a space and time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's\nReally no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to so it's almost like we own fashion in his view of the music industry\nBut only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars form of just kind of want to be on the conversation she tells\nBradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go when the homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho's very much and invention of pop music but you also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this town in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there isn't one\nUm road to same there is one path you just simply offend or geese and as opposed to there is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in at a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path agree with Anna about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on that same ladder and I think he kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about lady guy you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have said I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie if she is way more important to ... than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from Bradley Cooper they've had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley send a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character alley is just improvising love saw\nHim they found\nBack in time can do\n[noise]\n\nNo [noise]\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING

thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in the actors fully believing that you're the character

this month's meeting of the ... movie club with Ann Powers Linda Holmes and John hornets let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born\nHeater gene can you hear me yes I have five stars which why five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their\nLife being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was that continually said and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent I guess he was her age as the guy who made her over the manager Joe agent played yeah\nWhat what is your main character\nI didn't like him\nAnd I I guess I wasn't supposed to but the minute he had that conversation with jacks and um\nAnd and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start as of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of it and I I figure I heard you chime in as well\nNo that was mailed to go ahead yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager and I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them from the beginning\nUm but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film won\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour and make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on to say to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps for getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right now we're not sure if that would have like played that whole narrative in a different way from like\n... ... exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nBut they'll go ahead and go as\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the same monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of stars born in there and in fact all the bridges of us are going to have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost wasn't sympathetic enabler\nUm of of the male lead and who then\nWas like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he was going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the stars foreign versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine\nBe part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um I also just want to say before we end gotta get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know how um\nFor Ninety
