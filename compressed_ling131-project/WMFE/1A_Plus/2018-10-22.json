Gulf levels ocean levels as climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures\nOf homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing in the homes of weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that as governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point\nHas to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYou know it's it's such a fair point uh and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a are building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increased storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if then if you tell people where they can't lift that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean what less than\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice in the jury is and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk\nFor having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming um a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of it real statewide conversation likely county by county\nAround how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise in climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for property to be built and to be built and frankly in an ... resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with these increased storm of events and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be having to begin this conversation I think is going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're going to have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor ... take part in this discussion or a future discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly love to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is least Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it\nAnd mayor again thank you I appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the W well around listening area including Palm Beach Broward in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so\nHow do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing party is in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again uh um it to 'em and well aware and thankful for your mind to have the early voting we actually had some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI'm I mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money and modernizing or a system that is in desperate need of update\n'em and I will tell you I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy ... a leader\nUm he and I spent some time together for two years making our way through 'em in Aspen Institute fellowship when we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that the main then I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we began from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will um were sent there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars\nFor health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party\nIn order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party or with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't you know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue you have been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to\nGainesville uh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you make criminal justice reform one of the critical points have your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with the law at a young age inform these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system\nOne [noise]\n\n\nOne a continues next hour on Ninety point seven news across the country colleges are beginning

conversation with Louis Hernandez of double you all are in public radio and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get an another question for the mayor\nNo definitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign on but you already know this lord as one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that ... sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election\n[noise] yeah I mean I think we're doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate a across frankly all communities\nUm I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... no I think Trump won putting them thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today um which students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando hosted an event\nUm um buddy quest for getting them I'm a a little while ago I was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... a which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies\nAnd just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us is that in a primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand voters turned out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm it's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if it's the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another\nWhen one county I lose another the one who wins is the one who get one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there were gonna win because we're going to give voters a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Guillen so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners press will have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... to make two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already have castle doctrine which allows for individuals to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders um onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be clear the difference between what you're talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you're afraid to basically is that kind of your home is your castle idea of it says you have the right\nTo use deadly force to defend yourself at home or at work stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they probably will ... anywhere you have a legal right to be just to\nYeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a ...\nFor Ninety planes and the news comes from Orlando how are they know how I don't ... the hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nI out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already production in your home there's already comment last self defense which means and places where you are in public square\nAnd you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you've been able when you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me is it is it is a stretch too far um as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voices of Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws\nAnd to help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children I'm In black and brown children feel particularly I'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin case of Martin the case of marquee smug locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying and are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies\nBecause they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover or for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to clients dangerous as stand your ground is a ...\nPoint before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ...\nSo I Would say one yes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God it's a waste but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted or a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repealing ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou kiss you guys in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about an affront to the second amendment\nWas simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was to assume decency here and unfortunately the ana re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency\nBack into it Andrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate your making some extra time for so thanks very much thank you for the opportunity good luck everybody go vote to liberty and San Louis Hernandez the host of sun dialing double you all are in public radio in Miami you can find more of the stations excellent coverage including a guide\nTo all the referenda in Florida on this month's next month's ballot at W.

U. dot org\nSyria there was one more thing I did want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any unions and make all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that you and your negotiated for us on a ... dollar health insurance all that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent the higher level Caesar accountability\nThat will ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the percussion I feel that sometimes wants teachers have to\nSend your that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher marketer and ultimately compare ourselves through other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with a ... I Wonder what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off\nI've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done the one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers the union is not just your union leaders in men's are driven by numbers and lenders need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated

just hire a person for no reason to you have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said that we're going to let you go or you know and tired of the reason that's so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go Sarah I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think that residents of your state\nAre really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike but says except for all we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our communities realize\nYou know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it out hey are just about health care it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about and creating conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and I had seen with my own eyes legislators repeatedly putting interests that outside corporate interests over their own people in this state\nAnd that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate your making time for us thanks very much thank you without a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts\nNon union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair or equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers\nScott I think we should be clear with regard\nTo bill from Cleveland comment about non union members going it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions\nRight I Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um [noise] uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question two boys I think is an expert on down on drugs and she's joining us rhythm NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to one day hey\nJoshua and death Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in a very upscale district and I hope she makes it one of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to a little bit more about that in a moment I should also union contract I actually I don't usually contracts I should also introduced Vincent ... he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on\nVincent profile she's me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is the floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now they're stealing it depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good concept ... a context is for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage make very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice taste that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can't get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions anything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to just say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from mid Florida credit union mid Florida is committed to offering a wide range of personal and
