that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I don't take 'em myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students the students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like every single day I had to show up and I talked to scream at every single day I just show up in our math to my students had to be asked repaired and I taught sixty nine hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever there an eleven year old\nI what I learned there are a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are to be consumed and could be repeated back so my skill was like what I deliver was not only had to like get kids to understand like when the crazy one but like I did teach discreet skill like you know what you think started sometimes means multiplication rank and like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite side and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impact so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggled like they can get in like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it by the year and they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was an understanding of the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is that we think about the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access

[laughter]\nI'm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\n[laughter] not I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like throw jak to be such a hit with American ... well I I think you\nKnow the obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak and someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson [noise] um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park up and then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening it's going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak any scenario credible artist Carolyn sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and then a lot of others to you have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm\nSee them as one of the first people we cast\n[laughter] at times cast her whale\nAs a newscaster well uh we we had in the script you um you know a a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda la montage and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter] really I recalled I mean it's like yeah sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic you bring it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end result we also get you making some whale noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of as a very serious man uh goofing around going\n[noise] you know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think [laughter] well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison ... who is phenomenal\nNow you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned one ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is\nIn the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we can is Alison or in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we'd been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be a lead on our show any more um and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job\nEver since um but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about you know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our castles whites and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting these characters one of the time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles\nAnd I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it's not like this is a mistake we made\nI now for the latest on the historic gathering in her own thing [noise] um\nStay listening to solve the noon ad for for

worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest in welcome to one day\nA sex drive me Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer and major writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at a time as a receptionist\nAnd they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and uh uh I got the job and I you know I did it just get my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make somebody connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one specially on Saturday Night live\nThe live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera a and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows him through this hard show that that you know they ... a lot of them have never done live de before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure of the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed in a you know I rose up pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live\nUm the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are forming shows um and

well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of work\nThe first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on her med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I at the cue cards I've seen are all written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps\nUm it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the spacing between the sentences it's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the streets okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train it for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um\nTwo or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you could just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interview scrape okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalize only in certain words it's not capitalized in during whereas where how to end the card of courage to stand on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to

contacts or you're not were either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you're wearing your glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you'd want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you could see but that would also make less margin a card\nAnd it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you were telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just
