A. M. U. dot board Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to Yemeni friends in ...\nAnd ... they are living in hell and they ask why does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us what do I say\nSomeone before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex conflict\nA it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that he ... at the who the government and some odd that announced itself is actually in fact a a coup government that is run by militia\nAnd that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen\nNow the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in conflict with the Arab coalition\nThe aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and at is struggling to go back to places where there is no so see on Bush on the ground\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando hell to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health is dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nOr the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven Yemen had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the hook these and was president for some time\nBut I'm the sheer power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is that the Houthi militias had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of the enemies\nOf for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and and need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I didn't want to talk more about the the population on the ground that needs help I just want to both before we were next words and also just want to be clear there's a sectarian part of this these\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslim sectarian aspect to this also gives me versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the shot and Yemen I don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon or Iraq practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known ... and it's really different from ... which is a form that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles so many of them are and in Yemen we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sects of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years\nNow that said these are the who's the sect of of what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they do use them as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize say DSM into kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has them and the ...\nHas struggled to maintain ... as it is with the influence of well how does them instead of them coming into the country\nAnd so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two are fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people their fault that they were under occupation and the cost of secession\nAre rising day after day as this conflict continues\nOr do you want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying summer in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today now before we came on to be here today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with least grounding she's the UN's resident and humanitarian\nCoordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living and working beer here as part of our conversation that we to just a few minutes ago we've run day will come to want to\nThank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger topics how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\n[noise] in game and we are\nWorried that if steps are not taken right now in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year\nThis is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells and telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure with deprivation of be reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit name and there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the work work that's being done by frontline partners and UN agencies\nAnd officials here in the game and we've been able to contain the spread of how the Democrats have similar levels there's a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of was last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months\nOn supplemental rations when they are eating role limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start and this is absolutely what we're saying for millions of people in this country they're immune systems are weakening\nAnd that makes them highly vulnerable to infection and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people at the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program it from Chicago is Thirteen million people just by way of context leaf give me a sense of what a mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now\nMm\nWhat age

W. A. M. U.\nDot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. usually in Chicago to kind of asked them if they were tracking with us\nAnd one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this secretary and aspect like several of us and we have a winner re of of age range of your students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sex within the sects I think that's where a lot of it's kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what ... these people are with like why why does the sec why does this affect involve matter to this can you just kind of simplified force\nAbsolutely so when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically say day and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the\nCafes are cults and now now the ... conflict\nA kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see as the political importation of religious sects of what we're seeing that play is political Islam\nAnd that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the I'm\nKind of the guardian of ... and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is to ... them and so as soon as shower it's pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen\nYou know for instance when this war started we know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um nuclear deal with Iran and the sense they sacrifice damaged by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to try and find this deal with Iran\nNow that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran I and at the same time also had this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense okay so let me\nSo let me like I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat\nBack to you what you just said that I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... years and watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sect of Islam Sunni Islam and she Islam is this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we run is kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face\nAnd Saudi Arabia has kind of anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando how to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that too early into health dot com\nOr for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\n[noise] ... yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sites but for political reasons they are now aligning with each other\nGotcha gotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good sums up all around if you go and I I appreciate you explain that I think you know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some wars you can't just boil down to one cause but that also makes it hard for\nUs sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our T fan but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you describe the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n... telling her story is one of the reasons is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and the picture to the statistics otherwise they're just a test steaks and I think\nThan we we deal with with a lot of that of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I\nI was in ... I'm sure they've been sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels and uh and it's ... and in the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen ... the\nThe children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition ward and we were just filming there was some women and their babies' whenever a young man\nTall deathly than\nRushed in with the with a tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of close Senate was hit eleven year old sister name was ...\nAnd for the horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and\nWay too I think twenty four pounds was what was what what we had to what we had asked at the doctors that and it was\nAbsolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so among Doris Day also becomes so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to them and\nUh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals until the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming was ... speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family's story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school\nBut whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stopped to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war and that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\n\n[noise]\nDo you play ten years in the national football league you retire mostly helped me in very rich but then why\nRetired like some bigger out there for more on store there just highlights behind\nOn Cairo's all life after the game next I'm a marketplace [noise]\nOh the Lakers business news coming up all part of marketplace listening tonight from six or not he points to\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from Florida State university and boots recently completed raise the porch campaign which has created or enhanced Ninety four professorship details about the impact of one billion plus philanthropic dollars and FSU are at raise the torch died after a few dot edu\n\nEqual access to education is the law but racial issues can get in the way let's see how one school near Chicago was trying to get things better and what's getting away\nFrom W.

Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax cullop how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother checks club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way\nCan push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity\nAnd then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one way student did not do one scholarship does not mean that black and Latino students across the country do not are not to make re denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical\nIs to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to par south reactions that that finally\nWell I'd I'd not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason there are other reasons is is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not living in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all\nOf the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some of my past work and I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the ... with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin does that reflect your experience and all of my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of like her I said there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be more\nRegardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color they're like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blink if everybody you know some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who is also a feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare than the other students but the school has like I guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with I extra curricula and so it was just already is saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids aren't good you know but for someone who is in in any X\nFor Ninety point at a news comes some more land that will help whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health is dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six patients that tastes more information is that to do health dot com\nYou know trapped in between the margin they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there there's blankets by sleeping bag whereas like\nOf all the white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have state\nIn the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then\nYou got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but\nOther than that right I Do not really so you kinda have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it does is not the case you know I think it it goes to show in um which episodes that we must have done it was like most of the kids and his on news um tutoring sessions are usually white to an all white they said yeah All right and that that's part like you know\nPersonal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but that was just the one right that you know so\nWell to that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor Lewis carried tweeted I'm eager to share of the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years\n[noise] you know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like adding stand like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens and had the districts\nThey're tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts do we take it that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in higher tax get more they get better they get better teaching and so we take case it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at school like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structure that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in our society and and reproduce them in our schools and the ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how the attacks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history and tracking and general\nRace becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and
