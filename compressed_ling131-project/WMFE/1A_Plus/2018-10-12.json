A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh confirmation go\nIt seems to have had opposite effect so at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterm we will know in four weeks however\nIt looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state actually had\nA chance of surviving or in the case of Tennessee uh maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon teams to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr in a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward to and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships in like in like a shame said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of the FBI background\nCheck that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee about the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator ... Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the cancer can grill FBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face\nUm how much intervention get the White House do an essay supplemental background check\nWill click also and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up there she's up for reelection\nEven that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that led her friend Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months and last thing I'll say it she just last night I'm trying to take the fight from you know on this vote I think too\nThat the way that Trump they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California some sound the nation this is a court that's been a real starting from side the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on and she's very upset about that and try and\nAt times to administration is really breaking some tradition by not getting the home state senators any say in these ...\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the round up is up but a few more things to DC we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift for endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke him Tania\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nLeno health network a pediatrician that committed to helping tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adult had including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to central Florida family more information including locations that are laying down health dot com slash kids\nWhen in fact I don't want to put you in that style is by love this guy right let me give this\nI Love this guy right\n\nNow calling us was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder\nI I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity ... at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I could see was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to to the deep end this like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there is a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president\nTo see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior from a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him a it was just a very strange moment and I know for\nFor for for me and my heart just tried to move past it as quickly as we could and\nThe interest of MoviePass as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift and sort of herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British in has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after for post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ...

Saudis could buy arms to hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms dealer military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia worry I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case\nFits into the

sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you can help us fat\nCheck that yeah I think um it's it's really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul Newman arguing for a long time just as the commentator said\nThat we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians in you know ... ... attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy you know how to cut you short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporters this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that uh unless the unless hell of a sudden the journalists turns off alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate\nAnd debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a lawmaker invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the u._s.
