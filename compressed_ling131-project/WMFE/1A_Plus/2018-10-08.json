of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with ... only on a Johnson and motive sharing you know let me let you jump in and respond to comment before we keep going\nOn I mentioned that that Republicans might suffer on in the mid terms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business\nBut I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's had twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that as single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized taken out to the\nFish is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time than the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel are making my blood boil ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nAh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd I'm the only one I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence\nAs a yet or not race that that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual so and that's a very very broad description gr includes even just being funneled over your clothes against your will so right over here for what the number yeah go ahead go okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male\nSexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof or if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it because it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around is keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play let's see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusation\nEspecially like this is one of those moments so you ought to do where a lot of women including several who've commented on this program not that I think that the show was a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics silly on uh I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted just say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get\nBetter [noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabinet confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised in it was\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're committed to children's health by being health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years later how has over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that are window health dot com slash kids\nAnd not seem not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it isn't that a with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation in saying that uh men should face a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but\nCovering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court but I should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical

A. M. A. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the dissent Neal senses\nThe census really starts the whole process or the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives\nThe states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get there is a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years\nBut that that's how so every state all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the hunting to heal method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty ...\nUh and that's how we figure out that say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways or some legislatures have challenged ah the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including us all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nQuirks here and there are and the legislatures will bend draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be run minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymandering young that's when a that just sort of the pejorative term for when\nA party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that are where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting second year\nIn North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we'd had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress to both parties\nTo Washington to accept the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington that Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that the Conor Lamb seat in the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as well as the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nMore votes statewide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the states and North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went\nWithout a major party competitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks took a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as Todd of topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's also the same in North Carolina law by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we want it to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district\nAnd an ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G.

upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill\nA couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election mark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle\nSteve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures\nLook at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like a goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously if Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world\nHe sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com Mrs they say\nGerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current map this gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIsn't fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know\nWell the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives\nUh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there be no party is blameless in this uh gerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist to today\nAre going to win all the districts around it\nUh the a newspaper ... in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he it was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic um you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talked about today\nYeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these lines may not be fair right but the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric location to serve central Florida family more information including locations that early no health dot com slash kids\nThe shape of a pencil [noise] Joanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors that approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\nCheney fishy I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks that you've been witness to a folk kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans controlled aligned drying process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all look to government ... at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we are is also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republican to live in those districts into their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan and we are a lot of people are talking about even if they're\nThat a fish all that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and on a help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least transparent states when it comes to transparency in government",
