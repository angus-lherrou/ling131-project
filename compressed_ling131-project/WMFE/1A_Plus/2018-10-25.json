A. M. U. dot org\nThat common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how\nYour reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSuzanne one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do\nWith valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is all over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than the valuation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worse factors into all of this valuations\nBecame a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seems\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a valuation of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go higher they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance skiing is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich has engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements with the IRS as indoors sometimes after being pushed by a trust in the state attorneys\nI'm a ... and that ... that are widely used one of them the scratcher attained annuity trust which is a formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to pursue sway her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of when pat invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinds of things are a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get one more comment that was sent to in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs he Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people every she'd benefits and her father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute to actually get it now that would be interesting but so far all areas that he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes

A. M. U. dot org before we get to more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about\nThe IRS his role in all of this is their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how did they reflect on that\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS does um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the uh the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS get pushed Bach\nAnd you know from talking to the talks experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does something I'm their stock and force I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on and the case of all county um we've found no evidence that the IRS um my county as the company where they had they were putting the invoices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire an in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it's sort of a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and in other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or their statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges\nThose have since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer\nWe have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities who say based on uh the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said ...\nIt's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings um when it's hot to pay some taxes would have been a ...\nFor Ninety point at a news can some land out how to cover that whatever whenever and wherever Orlando healthy dedicated to providing many athletes act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms and urgent care location and forty six ... ... more information is that to their Landau house dot com\nUm his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not pay tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than the fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and\nOne of Donald Trump's fails casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was a and in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling ships took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if ... in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much did they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump into Trump's might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they've and pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only ... taxes but penalties in interest on the money that tote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities um another authorities could be looking at 'em\nWith us today have ended up in in federal prison for this\n[noise] ... federal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute it ... the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yet those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\n[noise]\nDo you suppose the world Trade Organization could just you know in the U.S trying to trade

interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London considering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order\nMark\nI'm well I I'll just pick cozy one
