drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in global way\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida\nUm but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not\nStrong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses is warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to\nThat well I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they had to have it in that\nThat those projections are coming true I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon concentrations in ... we are able to do a very good job at projecting\nA the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise] yes and there is cut and so there's complexity and how the

I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area\nIt was the first major speech on cyber as a national security threat think about that it is now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica Becker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has

stealing our secrets so\nNow might be a good time to go check your Facebook account the most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you law bright in without having type your password every time\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at\nAnd personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or try to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions as new post every day or so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through in its reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking\nFor content that might pilot our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove of the terror propaganda that we've removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flagged it for us\nNow once content had been flagged as potentially violated our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on the content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nA and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if he doesn't mind that the policy believe that that's\nGot to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise we have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent\nOf people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have\nNative language speakers because they really understand the way that language is he is so that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a controversy or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in wind\nSo for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on on identifying south farm effect of self harm\nYou catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook it violates terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatrician they're committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations that served central Florida family more information including locations that Arlen do health dot com slash kids\nTell us when something is going wrong on a site\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it's harder\nAreas where it's working really well with terror propaganda I'm with child sexual exploitation with them with fake account we now have technical tools that can flags in vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at a time of upload meaning nobody ended up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people\nSo that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how's that pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves for instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we will remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against\nTerror organizations and members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's representing al ... page that has been created for the purpose of ... somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through your review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and there'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly sometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or language copy and then there's other options I mean those other options there's that option to report somebody I Wonder\nHow much Facebook is
