W. A. M. U. dot org\nThe medical I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization\nOf today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know ... named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a a an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but it is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corner so I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge of this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but he would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixty\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nRelated health network a pediatrician that committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their well being from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years later how over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations at Arlington health dot com slash kids\nReally fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a few sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats and art and have control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that they're doing they're making good effort and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to\nFolks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly working out the types of voters infrequent voters here say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that typically when we look at the electorate that shows up for Mitt term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennial voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and met her mirrors\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get above sixty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch gold at the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee as they don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house\nOf turning the house to play but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pick up some ten feet or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three at turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans control every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou have this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling water some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a to run Congress ... the Democrat and your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public polling showing it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field when I was gamed out\nOr how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\nBut to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the God love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House but state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but if it's a hero in that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own ad for and you know the raiders coach or not if it's a if it's issue where if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need a whole I Need some polls you are to divide and it it actually changes my vote the old change my vote\nAlan thanks for your comment Dominican\nThat cracks me up or if he wants to run for office you should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so I\nGet a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go to drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nIn the new one more than ... yeah\nHe continues next narrow naughty point seven news\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions is a defender of religious liberty but his support selective\nAs a public face of this government which is very protective of religious liberty and then the real work that they're doing is only protecting religious liberty rights of those who are religious conservatives\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly when the administration's views on religious liberty conflict with other priorities this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nStay listening this afternoon at for for all things considered here or not he point seven\nRight now we're counting on you to put a dollar value on your Ninety point seven W.

I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for tax or the Democrats who have done\nThat to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad brush\nYeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example or by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this mid term\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org the listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advice to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness\nSupport for Ninety points at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers of central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available online ...

numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... of out L G T two candidates running some from spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered just in a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think of a lot of Native American candidates ah you know just in New Hampshire their ... who is\nA an openly gay man he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire Democrats now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when I'm when I'm a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three have been democratic women\nJust if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running ... that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined sewer nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven so it'd\nBe I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman who'd been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right it was a wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah\nAfter Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill ... have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll and you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between your cinema the Democrat and most of the valley the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat\nOf I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but did we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans and I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to two women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative went and\nFrom the local the local level seats all the lap so nothing that really reflects

director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso see what this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome\nThank\nBrian can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea of at the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity a start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently the describes how over the last forty years\nGeographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at aged Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity international data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall ... after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example of wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions are going a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nMichelle emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands travel to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\n[noise] well I don't have any empirical data why so many uh employees are working in national\nTraveling there that I Know and I live there that are as a caters everyday into the city and out and many of those they coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get that people that we have entered the jobs that are out there\nYou see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I I feel like you know my point of view is that it sort of a wider industry perspective and the sense that at work in technology for the last ten years and\nCutting can am sharing looking at each other a hike and and I'm an Asian such as automotive construction manufacturing they're just get these shortages across every single sector whether it's factoring or in high tech\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from goodwill industries of central Florida goodwill\nIs committed to helping veterans who are homeless unable

Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a ... plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U.S has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties they want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street\nIf you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers aren't increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and warehouse and supply chain industry\nAnd we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months and we're really struggling with two items one is employed turned over where there\nAre chasing higher wages and and new facilities are new employers and secondly\nTo hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent has definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your ... your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to them their brain drain some

... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning\nThanks Joshua\nSo this is called the come home or war they tell us what the come home award is how does that work\nYeah the ... award program that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will have significantly a pie completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work as really come home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in the St Clair river\nUm our largest town of course you're out as a population of about thirty thousand people we did not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down to match Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities our small town America\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\n[noise] yeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is\nGreat for Detroit um but the health of American out the Michigan I think is better judged on the economic health of regions like pork here at our Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is are are true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it here earlier than than at the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people that's really one of the things that led to this come program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was the last to be government business\nAny other sector we realize that we had to get together and play a piece in economic growth\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Eileen Dole health\nArena how network a pediatrician that committed to tell the intel maybe health care partners
