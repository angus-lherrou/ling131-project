you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\nYou know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist you I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain and they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent on my own experience\nCan you share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot as you had Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly then I went to expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly and you know I think frankly it was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but you know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame\nUm in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nNo last week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh of having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Fort Sam\nIndelible and they had the camp this is the laughter for is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus ... and what adults\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDr Ford and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that fit that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional um but\nForget other details like\nUh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are relevant in the moment the assault this happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nIt kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way you described it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you walking drawn in house you forget all the decor but that being that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin derives dots wouldn't codes that I Would

S. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus\nAnd other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon is on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] step doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but we would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force and then now controls space activities of the military it's called a U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where as separate from what's already happening so I was I get a second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nAbout it if you just listened to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there and we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized ... as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it that could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render us all expect\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nMm\nComing up the south I knew at noon on ... point seven news\nSupport for Ninety point seven in ... park where Dr Gary Parker Dr Sandra Barker and Dr Caitlin Kelly provide comprehensive I can including diagnosis and treatment diseases contact lenses all types and service optical duty but nor I associates W.

shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in the basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body are transplanting a human consciousness into a computer [noise]\nAh so first of the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions is also reduce some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program the robot attracts you to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put ... to to put our consciousness I live I said I don't have to\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nEvidence of that is how many books are still written on it but it's evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three bucks [laughter]\nWe got grabs [laughter] not still writing books on its alone this law obey gravity so um but it sort of applauding all of your electro chemical impulses into sewing machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take your brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of translating brain what I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure AOL is at least find a way to transplant the brain of an outsider space in into the body of 'em\nAre just starting to brain of an air less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nIs that this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of mentally Savage [laughter] very Frank and started to really I I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet\nWe'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly hope so no one wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and your sticker class in any scoop out some water and the ... of water really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nBut you haven't looked through or so we've only taking a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who studied the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook

have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but it I regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting have any insurance plan ... that you put a little bit of money and for a to protect you against a devastating saying that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over and nature and heed the warnings of scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be fairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp\nOf the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of guilt today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically home full so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they asked\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil like green no because you reach a point where people say no this was to this is\nThis I cannot tolerate any further only eat people I don't want a\nPeople are so rich that breed is too hot [laughter] [noise] right right so you\nSo you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and ... story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ...
