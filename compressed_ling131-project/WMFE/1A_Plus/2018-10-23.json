uninterrupted programming donating a dollar a day with W ... or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOr week demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textural right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors and the leader can use them out on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context it's changed the followers are in a different place and\nIt doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we will use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and how would therefore be to star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that have played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on a leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen whereas Timothy responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven dwarves so he kind of you kind of wanted it that\nWay it's very common I mean if you think about it everybody a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she\nDid an extraordinary job pushing his team to created a masterpiece he wanted to ask him that and it was a natural problem but it cost him huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWhich we can to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders myth and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWell results matter and we'd claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nWhy is America continuing to provide weapons that fuels the world's worst humanitarian crisis next time on one [noise]\n[noise]\nNot everything is a business but you can build a business

W. A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from the\nOther side that are a quaint and ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and out in times past and\nI always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided that the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the words threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a\nThreatened yeah let's go back and look at some of the cage when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution among something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me on my love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalist interviews because I really do want to hear their side Jackie Kennedy once said\nThat he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side in that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Ninety points grabbing W.

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOverly and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going a lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president to to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you've said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive I hear you on that but the president\nDidn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for hand full that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press would didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN they had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I wanted to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business on and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so I didn't\nKnow how to square ought to I mean you give the president good advice what why wouldn't they stick to it well I think would edit of happening\nIs there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and Bannon out of there I made it very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job it was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I Would have been happy to do that I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ...\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points\nFor him to find out even more than ... but there's a lot like me any more than he likes to preserve it on your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press he could have kept that advice even after\nYou left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise]\nUm no actually ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the ten am meeting where I've been announces ... over a Tim in Iowa alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press conference he looks at me as I say it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI listen to what you declared war on the media and you can't declare war on the media first of all you going to lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president or television star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people that don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside the calm seems like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these stories that\nAre on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm just saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently\nOver ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like but they they ... with them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dialed down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we have to do then is you got to tell him straight you say man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nLook more at ... dot org\nDon't miss the next Ninety point seven W.
