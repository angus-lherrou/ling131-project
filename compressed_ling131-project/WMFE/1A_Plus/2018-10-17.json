the the people I Love here and so uh the seat opened up and I I felt that um I Would\nHave a good chance of winning and so I decided to run to be a strong voice for the people of New Mexico\nNow New Mexico's first district just looking on the map that includes Albuquerque and some of the areas south east of New Mexico is that right\n[laughter] so well there's some areas north and there's some there's some areas east and West is two tribal communities and the district Sandia Pueblo and the ... a Navajo Nation chapter [laughter] so um\nSo it does it geographically it's not large but it has a very diverse population so that's\nGreat now if you win next month's that would make you the first Native American congresswoman in American history what what would that mean to you\n[noise] well of course what I always say is that I Can't speak for my tribe or any tribe\nBut at my perspective growing up uh in to a ... a woman uh with my my mom and my grandparents you know teaching may our culture and traditions and just understanding you know having worked for several tribes and and understanding\nAbout the issues and the challenges that we face a which\nIncidentally are are the same as a lot of other places in New Mexico and across our country so I just feel like having that perspective at the table will mean you know something um something good for a for our country a voice that we haven't yet heard\nGive us a sense of what some of those issues are that might be affecting tribal populations in your district that you'd like Congress to pay more attention to or deal with

as well we are on in my campaign I have a I have\nWe've made renewable energy I'm pretty much the number one issue that I'm campaigning on and I think that ah that would create thousands of jobs for the district and not just in the in the city of Albuquerque but in the rural communities so um so that's one thing turtle communities always always\nCared tremendously about our education system\nAnd so that's something that that is high on my list as well as well as health care right we we have of our population here in New Mexico is Medicaid eligible that includes\nUh the twenty two tribal

A. M. U. dot org\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland and it is on page Amy one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down paging he won the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that first place\nA sure\nAnyone in the office it while we were asked of okay\nWhen we were half a mile from home or Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat ... kept both hands on will and looked straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland id and sub my red black and green African medallion it into my public enemy T shirt you told me to sit up keep my hands on a dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer knelt down and lifting your window when I saw your face or close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits officer asked why we had in Mississippi license place\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have I done anything wrong officer\nWhen officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you sped up behind me so I said no and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face if he asked for your license in registration\nIs that your man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to there and well and you pointed at officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may I have your badge number please\nI hate it how it sounded when you didn't use contractions officer as both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said last time\nWe have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was ... toward the driver's side window you slapped me across much that's what the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious my fist right as another officer pulled up\nThe first officer who is now laughing walk back to the second officers car you eventually shelter second officer your license and your University of Maryland I D\nD officer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night\nNever give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I wondered why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot your black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you kill yourself I hear you I told you and try to make you laugh\nWhy don't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't\nAnd they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot a you said oh you wouldn't I told you that fool got matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking\nYou might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English save you though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWell I was in my room changing you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cut it in a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people are allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style or fly\nOut other eggs are crew heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crux of a lot of uh the relationship are talking about in his book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school in eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school over there and when my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a knife away treated a knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes and often a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so uh my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what you're not giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out to the library without checking it out and I got in trouble so I just wasn't sure about this\nFor Ninety point revenue comes from Eileen how\nAre they know how network a pediatrician that committed helping out by the health care partners dedicated to their well being somebody can they do this all important teenage years later how positive or twenty pediatric location parents friendship or the family more information including locations that are in their house dot com slash can\nLive outside at home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to ask you this section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom issue we're trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand how did that affect your relationship with her\nYeah one one way I think a lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were right some things that were wrong\nUm she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more [noise]\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about what's like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship", "year": "2018",
