scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nOr do I know I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the key to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago the grand case it basically said that\nWhen you are determining whether or not an officers engaged and they use that excessive force it much basically\nTake

result you find very few judgments first of all you know in in civil and suing police departments jurors have to again how hold the standard\nAnd prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer had to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation have done so it is the Supreme Court that has set this rule for\nAll law enforcement agencies in the country and they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court sets of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way we refer to the keys is Graham versus Connor it's a case from Nineteen eighty nine and so have you actually commented with regards to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like today was the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force and the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military were they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon Spalding the Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department who worked undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNo I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened to cause some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you what what happened that caused such a stern did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were actually involved and the money that are kind of trade with and the Chicago area and\nTherefore I began\nAnd operation dumped operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI used that term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed the officers wanted them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nOr they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so maybe very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because I drive all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality in law enforcement\n... honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on as police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually\nFear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common straight officers going against other officers went actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBy says we're actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up or they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier and easier than
