talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happened to be you know when a studio WHM you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it\nBut D.C as locals know it uh there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage\nFor tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grass roots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was in the coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting this very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue\nWhat does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for tipped workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back within the city council voted to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nUm federally than minimum wage protects workers there's two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for\nA couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents technically if you don't make enough tips to bring that ah wage up to that but I'm the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face rampant sexual harassment or vulnerabilities because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nA Michael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters these is remarkable but what about the economics of it\nActually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it wait until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those where they're supportive and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employee using DC\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips made when am wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour in and they did that because they heard from tipped employee as you said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money to come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of ...\nFor Ninety points at a

form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment\n[noise] a shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and

lectures are material\nOr material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to our rage and so reject ideas that said that when we're angry about legitimate injustices that this\nIn some way make irrational or makes our claim illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive\nOr harmful it mean\nThat we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\n'em and more women need to give themselves permission to do that\nI've given myself permission to do that on it in this moment I Am on the front lines of thanks for women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for\nUs to change that very scary our trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about or we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room in the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks\nSerena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court Serena Williams intimate exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America ... is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger a weaponized against her\nUh yes I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in her back and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct are sponsors of the responses were the people\nThat really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um Amos exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment and the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as\nA athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live there\nWere some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova was response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said marching speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serena was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing\nJust because men region umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulated\nWhite I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong\nOr she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it at the moment of solidarity she tried police arena conduct I'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am living but Martina Navratilova reminded me that up until this moment\nMost white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters\nDo when I watch tennis with my friends were African American can expand we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women who are often knocking at the Williams sisters in having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated three to\n\n\nComing up with something at noon on

Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book rage because her\nNow I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton into twenty sixteen campaign and I don't want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoals at how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton\nHas a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand ... campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry [noise]\nThe tone of the campaign became [noise]\n\nNot your fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that in Hillary fashion\nSays I regret how nasty the campaign became a ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's whacking here in the studio with me now to strike you [laughter] know she was also a ... she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um it was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial the parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they can pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... right it's so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration\nAnd we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex at a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough said smile as if it was like some cat color on the street smile more um she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own\nMemories of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her and how menacing an aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but then she was thinking no no no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's going to make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us about\nHow much energy women expend\nModulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expression\nNow I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger goes because\nSupport for Ninety

another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Farrah from Cincinnati when I'm at my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it it really doesn't get much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as\nBeing angrier overreacting women yelling even in this day and age is not very acceptable\nMen don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just the personal issue I'm dealing with what they're going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however I Am so angry so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action\nHasn't helped it feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that but when they have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it\nAnd that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from when he listeners women who it feels like there's a scene there are transferring some of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just

immediate effect um\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing a that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a title even twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by uh the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have\nThe first black woman I'm governor of a state of a former slave state um the ... practically campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but we're particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have that channeling our anger", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "03"}
