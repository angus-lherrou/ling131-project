Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nA Bill Clinton's answer was lampooned at the time it's still remember now\nTwenty six years later what political moments do you remember from the Nineteen nineties we want to hear from you what did they tell us about our politics today you can comment on our Facebook page you can tweet us ... when a you can email us one day at W. A. M. U. dot org we heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started\nWell before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues\nSince the civil war and we still have never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America I remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today\nAnd nonpartisan up Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribal isn't in politics\nWhere we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during the impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager he helped impeach Bill Clinton and then went before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended Kavanaugh he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBut for any planes and the news comes from Orlando how are they now Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national rankings available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nWells hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nHere forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget backwards for you have a good temperament and\nDisposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quick to me and any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans had your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk vacation in the ... say to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean if it tells me that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the\nThe lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in ... well after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally it looked at the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country's been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election led to a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told and boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he if he converted what's he think yeah I mean look there's and there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his ... during popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons to Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he added the golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party would go down this road\nAnd then seeing Donald Trump win the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one\nI think tells Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans\nThat this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufactured in fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if when he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised\nAt how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and and Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising to you yeah ... what he's describing his ticket splitting yeah at the end political science they'd be the voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket\nHas been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal is All right let's get back in our way way

assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there's nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous

ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on a hill\nBut the hard truth is that not everyone is Sherry and the city's splendor and gory\nThere is just fair Mr President and the faces that you don't stay in the places that you don't visit\nAnd your shining city\nAnd I believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh gosh the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul [noise]\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to harm the Arsenio Hall show remember him for first anyhow [laughter] before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years achieve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second in third place in the presidential race at that point versus a Ross Perot [laughter] taking place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton if they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the\nI didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer early tried scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Eileen Dole health\nHealth network a pediatrician that

for president as an independent in just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteer submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em and and George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did send you a whole show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that and Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency\nTo go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not that's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama\nHad a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to a great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than\nThan maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has changed just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nAnd the rise of Gingrich in that moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from with Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time were the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he use CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or to Donald Trump do\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties was CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "04"}
