M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOn gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time a note noticed that that that that this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying words are not bullets in social media posts I have a body count to zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action and I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets\nAnyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence when it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens\nA lot of free speech communities online that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous or is it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalued speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing rice um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRabbi checkers I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like get out and get us off the only place with this kind of speech proliferate online is worth noting since our program one a as may end up to be First Amendment the first to limit lesson hate speech is protected\nBy the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks like you\nShirt well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true it said how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want\nThey also just wanted to say something about that ... that one of the to respond to one of the face the comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes until we\nYeah well I I I'm Sorry where am I going to do you wanna get a little deeper into that a lot of folks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil\nOf anti Semitism and every other forms of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and

from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping trumped telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and rude if you liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nRace in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions there needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful devices speech that his anti American\nJournalists need to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rants if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious leaders and also very much by mistake I think there's a strong feeling\nAmong a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views and a close and actually the state of Israel I mean I teach at a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable outs Yeah Bill that um\nYou know the express a\nStrong and here is that Israel or its best religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know we\nI mean there are students who are you know are not typically\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly that find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence and the left of that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do some kids who probably should need need to shut up you know I'm not a fish out of it but the you know you can't argue with ever\nJust kind of how you're gonna have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that and not\nAn idle everything will David I'm going to be it can be very hard\nDavid let me put that to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rabbi what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie or speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism in Alaska and very often it expresses itself as\nAs attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of the trials governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses a line and we have to be really clear it out where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies that rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nThere who carry out violent acts and say that they're motivated by hatred of Israel that the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store manager of a store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism they'll laughed what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred\nA ... racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nSeven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... in a number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply some more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states or expanding protections and who they're covering\n[noise] yeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduce legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending force arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York\nTimes the California and he mentioned Vermont in Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements\nAnd so how many hours messed a employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that passed in California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from you know here is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart end as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to put that on my social media ... it can change your reputation I really wish I could have protecting myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFor a certificate how common is this for freelancers I mean the situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive to provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law suits and whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year ... required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen that share and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that they've been creative\nI'm well today are thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from the long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nSupport for Ninety point seven news comes from S P o after a storm hits restoring power safely and

A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator had a best jak since I was like ... California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's ban a real leader in this case those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session\nAs well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time off and for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action so\nYou know we joined the national science lesson or joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week calling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon\nFor other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws and meaningful way many states Emily that you're targeting in particular\nWell I think one of the things that we have seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a pass new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement as a condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne holding your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nAnd introduce a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment or place in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder Susan and if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities wouldn't be are used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states and their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nPressure typical before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's a type that you mentioned that people find that to start over there and play meant that says keep our information confidential and that was another type of people find usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer\nAnd those are just settled the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think it had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line the case\nFor someone who stick with you for me I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or helpful or hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there may be some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nThe contracts that you sign up the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes it clear that does can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract that keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed\nFor Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando how to cover the whatever whenever and wherever Orlando Health it's dedicated to providing many pathways act care including nine hospitals and emergency rooms ten urgent care location and forty six outpatient centers more information is that to Orlando Health dot com\nAnd the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiffs lawyers say that they like these provisions because it's moved the path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing is kind of hard about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning us information aren't at the table future back then potential victims of harassment they don't have a say in whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nWas because of some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on well that's a great\nQuestion if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond setter ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed in one state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is the baseline that covers", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "29"}
