I mean I I think people are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is this carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting and even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical left me a lecture on ethics\nWe're going to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and\nWant to try to do the pressure I Try to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth and this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and then I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is obviously this issue right now\n... guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I've surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and and it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of Ninety point seven W.

I think I actually have three I think the second one was love your neighbors you love yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the our somebody's ... loves Trump or somebody who hates Trump\nHow are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President the gutters deeply about what do you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you love of God you can't\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up as there is need that your words might give grace to those who here\nAnd so it's not that not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media how are you allow your words to give grace to others as opposed to these humanizing them or you know so if you could\nBecome a passage ... author some people who we just need to have it feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I feel like it just it's too satisfying to take the\nMoral high ground men say what you know those people whoever those people are that are needed\nTo hear and I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talking I'm tired of bite my tongue aged fields to satisfy its uh finally letter it\nI think that's exactly right I think that's where we feel that we have to guard against I think it\nIt naturally now there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think but sharing what you think in a way that reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but I could be wrong about this and that treats the other as a human being is really important and most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and\nWhat if I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about the second ago about the nuances the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull a diverse and I can then you with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one verse out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters and Twitter and thankfully they doubled the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred and eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching\nAnd prophetic preaching has to do is saying the hard things you know in addressing justice in and righteousness always things [noise]\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching I ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people or influence them\nIt irritating people's easy but just not hard to say something that's going to hurt their feelings or irritate them or make them out\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you got to figure out how do I do that\nSo if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feel totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching on controversial issues are typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this see if this well here's wipe off of people in this I'd see it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by those but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew your preaching is I was going to hate your sermon 'cause I kind of had a feeling where you are and why they came in ready to hate but then the way you approached my side\nOpen my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat's gotta be hard for you though as a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm no just personally in your own and\nI I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk I Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation is knows the obligation on a pastor and who's trying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like\nBeing told I was ready to start arming Iraq believe that started to\nBefore I let you go pastor Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided in that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Orlando", "day": "30"}
