bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty\nDavid what do you think well cyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems\nUh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use a similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide one ounce it as happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back\nYou know who to attack yeah great married before we move on\nFrom there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to\nShut down a power grid or turn off a hydroelectric dam through the Internet but beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing

and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond or you you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or is Russia really got the whole world kind of running with us here I'd\nLike to see what we've seen in the last couple of days is coordination of um indictments and you know raising this concerns about um sighing and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that that that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many ah restrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general on cyber threats\nAnd as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us in the

out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nAlthough it's funny kind of a decentralization of the way
