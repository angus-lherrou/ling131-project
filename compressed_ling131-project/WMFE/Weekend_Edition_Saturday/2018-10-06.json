supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bussing forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] I'm wires that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she did\nFor Ninety planes at a news comes from Orlando Health Orlando Health Arnold Palmer hospital for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national ranking available on line ... Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nMy story but I won't tell it to the Senate and [laughter] you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations\n[noise] um and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're messing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically choose the crowd I wasn't aware of that because she was well so she had basically Jesus cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen to shoot\nPeople basically his cooperation were her therapists notes which seemed to say look she talked about this all they're not with Kevin ... name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraphs and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contact with the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen ...\nLet me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she said she found Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support Frank a judge\nNow the world from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out ... thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you'd end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which\nIs terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until\nProven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise] um it's not\nThe same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations jumble Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat's easily their head or of this one I don't think that to news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father for Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around\nFifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty barren that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president has said on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] ... is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the buildings so they would be taxed at a lower rate\n\nThis is NPR News the\nNew York times revealed this week that Donald Trump got almost all his fortune from his father including two
