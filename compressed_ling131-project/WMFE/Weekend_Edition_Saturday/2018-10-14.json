Arnold Palmer hospital dot com\nAnd more on their utility bills about one in Tampa data except the twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce in a line of entertainment it can actually be much more cost me and take our line right now it's time\nTo ... and an overhead wire\nBack to ... and flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more of his independent micro grids with solar power and batteries and places like water treatment plant hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we also need to be the sting restraint and ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population you keep the lights and even if they brought him down\nMcNamara was lead author up uh twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change that's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industry\nJeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's elections closed in Florida we know Florida has a big presidential prize it's also hosts a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season mark a poodle covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nBy driving so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago you see a lotta storms comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's cause\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of wave in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now if there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once can flush area into a desert just stripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction\nNo trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of a Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been to a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points\nAnd it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally rich scholars running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes so he's been kind of all over\nAll both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott as governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far that Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is the executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee mayor\nBut it was hit pretty hard it was hit yeah a\nTallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum buys punt round the Centers for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly\nIn in one case actually chainsaw in trees away\n[laughter] and I'm moving debris frilly so he's changed trades he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone is trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again to understand that like the entire pan handle it can be almost impossible pull right now because you can't get a hold of a half you know eating in a sense of the people\nThat's political as my computer joining us from
