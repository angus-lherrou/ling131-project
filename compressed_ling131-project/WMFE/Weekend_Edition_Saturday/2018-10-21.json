this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nI mean governments are certainly a crowded into a display their

M. S. dot org or cold one hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nAn American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think and they've been very calculated in terms of how they're fully released information really to extract as much I think liberated possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero and the story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others are so they're clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one ... and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important [noise] important important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange than even less meant they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF are a lot of very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nUh and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to host sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water although there remains have never been found their deaths were very sleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government\nAnd of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this was published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the event was a fabrication\nIn these official version they Mexican Government said that they are to me and they say that at least they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends these used official start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf the investigation is that all the official they're showing you sound like it's not it's a lie\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked these students and why they were attacked what I discovered\nWas that the army and the ... not Joss Whedon Nazis about why do I stop any that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these even more\nI had reports on the show the reports that proves that the army and police way\nChasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that so the\nFederal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students killed\nWhile that students arrive near the water the army the police they state police were waiting for them then students decide to move that to Boston where they were dressed birth dating insight to the CD\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nThey do do that you bosses and when their students were trying to escape ... be spy buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staples east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they all get Dave on the back way to process\nFrom these two buses disappeared all day ... students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses I'm to the people that were on those buses the students on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation closed um if the students were targeting inside bond says why did I did was just too\nI'm not so these two versus what exactly did to boast is that the army and they said that police it starts to money to rate\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two both as was the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why ... so what I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the bus secret compartment as harrowing to me as a harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students the ... vote the army and if it that belief\nThey knew it so these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these guys that are really tragic it I see that they didn't know\nYou're

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local track scheduled I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person\nDoesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run than say somebody running for US Senate seat or a U.S house seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation would reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's get Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie\nAnd the state house but if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that sitting as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national times just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have chased a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave\nThat's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much that you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre President Nixon had up ended the Justice Department having let go

at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas in a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival down over his long used\nFor\nSelf hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWell your name is Raphael you know you go by kid that's an Anglo sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tried Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized you said we reached him earlier this week and asked them to explain\nWe use our identity sometimes in a in a very good way to use I dressed in for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can over your side of the day that we can bring these in when they don't do much good\nAnd also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work them actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why people are different from each other\nSort of the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading best still matters in the wilderness or man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take them seriously and many particle complex I'm the most important thing isn't that managed to maybe that the most important thing for them it's not that should be able to get our kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions\nAnd it may be that the candidate who's best for that and those are the kinds of things that's the one on the ground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co opting\nI think for me I Would say I mean I should onto your question directly gingerly constantly [noise] I\nI think you can easily go wrong I mean one of the things that the president is currently is mobilizing identities in a burning devices and not me I'm a terrible road because once you've created a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to build a room\nAnd it's a temptation for politicians around the world will through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the most conservative and liberal\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the

more information including locations that early and do health dot com slash kids\nEverybody none of our desk and things for themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense from re vote them whoever wins or we sort of gather behind an order burgers ribs around the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a real motive concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nNow I think I think it is we're I mean look the factors in our country is a very were more defined as around the country and we're around polar bears\nSo that if we start using them devise we could probably come through reasonable concerns is on a whole bunch of things I regret abortion as a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us\nBecause the people who are mercenaries and both groups think every commercial you know coming together but losing losing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nOf the question is whether you can do that with what your goal Rodney ... and I think your term I think you can do for example more about the actual bonuses\nDemocracy for compromise I'm turning everything into an identity issue and make some very hard to compromise\nKwame
