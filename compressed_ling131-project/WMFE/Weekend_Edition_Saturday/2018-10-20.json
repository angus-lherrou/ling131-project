... is dead the account places blame on senior advisors none of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there is a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm is that earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is how one Saturday defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and

think\nOne of the questions to be asked is the quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington\nHi I'm off on taking all of our president and general manager of made the point that W him after it's been a full two years since we first tried

M. S. dot org or call one eight hundred Seventy five twenty twenty\nOn citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies I first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen\nWhich by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership or in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to a\nPoint of dying and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to except to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference in around elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and\nOne would hope that a\nPresident of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly\nAnd make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain does interest but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo I'd thirty seconds we have left a if not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we named\nTop two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit if it knew you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that they were ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news joined just in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at a sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented\nYeah you're right in the article that to the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects the change in no way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty fifty\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans maybe feel veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the Aden branch of al Islam\nAnd all those lives that right is a very important political party in Yemen to his longest party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes a hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA I'm Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us report now you you should just in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether you as individuals can service officers can and listening foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nYou've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I I mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are numbers on lots of\nA lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short\nRight you know and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or us ally that really is against the law that is going to ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend here are are there the only ones who've done this are there other countries who try it [noise] um are there other Americans\n\nThis is NPR News [noise]\n\n[noise] Senator Elizabeth Warren got in trouble for saying she

S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nLong strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... is right\nAbout that for decades us presidents from both parties who felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly analyst and residents of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi times\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this or transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or it here but it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about the show ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military and those are the biggest orders of the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom has pledged forty five billion dollars and helped bankroll tech companies like ... and looser motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel process and author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they'd been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Grossman says both the U.S and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed\nFormer President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but\nBronson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly whenever\nThe station has put all of their eggs in the south African and they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner than the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin selmont as the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged to show jeeze death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now\n...\nYears as where this is so\nSad but Bronson says Saudi Arabia was already backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhich amount to show he represented for many of us flies disbelief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he couldn't be patient he he expected to the patient when he didn't expect with their reversal that he was seeing with monitoring from on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work with lawmakers even as the president's stresses he wants to preserve those multi billion dollar arm sales Scott Horsley NPR News Washington\nThe state of Nebraska is becoming a new ad campaign to encourage tourism or at least not disappoint those who do come to visit one ad shows a happy half dozen people voting downstream in an empty livestock tank that's apparently I never asked cruise ship with the headline lucky for you there's nothing to do here\nThis is NPR News\n\nOr you don't tell me is celebrating their twentieth anniversary you can help support Ninety four and seven WM heavy during our silent drive and get some cool wait wait don't tell me twentieth anniversary thank you gifts at W.

I mean there last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series in Nineteen eighty two\nAnd of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know that this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season in Boston in Boston that's right and if they are they wait exactly yes and a Christian taller debuted as assistant coach for the Washington Wizards\nShe's also she'll playing in the NBA for domestic Mickey Hammon of course has already in assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think it's overdue when they make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA he's been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris Burke on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not\nThat big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter] no and in in that sport it's a big deal and in professional sports in the the male dominated game\nAnd also let's not forget that the ESPN actually put\nThe you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen\nIt's um it's it's going to be good\nWomen's tennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's gonna be a rule change it Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final ... what do you think of the rule change should go to the er about what what are they going to do it the highbrow break yeah\nAfter twelve after twelve twelve and they're going to go to a tie break the way to the way that they do after the U.S open after after the fact that tie breaking I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they can get to a big deal\nSupport for Ninety point have the news comes from Orlando Health\nOr Leno health network a pediatricians are committed to children tell by the health care partners dedicated to their wellbeing from birth to adulthood including this all important teenage years or Leno health has over twenty pediatric locations to serve central Florida family more information including locations Arlene do health dot com slash kids\nAnd our and that it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe [laughter] uh Howard thank you you're in San Francisco good they're commemorate in fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nFor the baby up and HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers live or to the infant at risk transferring HIV or\nWhat the child grows sugar and most likely die child received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV\nThe surgery is your first and could significantly changed the pool of organ donors in South Africa we're about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world\nDr Harriet death riches and medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and she was part of a team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing and the baby's doing very very well we are very yeah after\nThe ... happened now and to see the child that live in driving under the circumstances with this world famous case is obviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWill help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't\n[noise] [noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for a living donor for three times the average and the child was getting really thick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what if the parents tell you\n[noise] so the parents saying to us\nWhy ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider s so there was this need that to wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the diner that she could be a diner and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote Senate Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much much of eight to buy a request from the very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the life of their child\n[noise] doctor Etheridge do think this uh this case the more people know about it will love contribute something to lifting the stigma or they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hurt so you know HIV sticking there is an extremely complicated thing and it's\nIt's a multifaceted says to us and South Africa although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to shine through what we've done had is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in a normal life", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "20"}
