university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later I started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but

don't we make so\nTo the outside world your mother a progression of voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson,

make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around ... chant\nShe started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was

you one of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just dramatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAnd individually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of beer between which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd it was sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing nobody pushed my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life oh man\nI'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me I'm sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date until another date\nProbably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there is a shame when we show people into people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's talked to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the watchful myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling most as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be\nA writer or read or a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way\nIs like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lemon has book heavy

cola Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups are showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state this camp is also a Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman with member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flags for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases to basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a poll or a an election worker input the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this is the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about uh not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they said that this violates\nThe voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy undercount he's actually following the state law and his office says you know this exact match for the call it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams to Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the recession it\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so that's all about who's going to have to show up Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC thanks so much thank you\n\nDavid Sheff realized his teenage son Nick was living on the street to dictate to
