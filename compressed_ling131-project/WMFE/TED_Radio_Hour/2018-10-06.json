I think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nBones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of coronary heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to pain or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg so into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nYou might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that\nThey would never have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like this like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that these prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting a gene editing into kind of too\nBut for any planes at a news comes from Orlando how are they end up health Arnold Palmer hospitals for children had been caring for the children and teenagers at Central Florida for more than twenty five years more information including national ranking available on line ...

advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and said that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for some of that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only effect that individual\nBut that individuals children ... and their children and their children and their children\nAnd so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even seeing that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use him embryos to install

have\nA a an inkling of who we are\nThis is Steven Pinker Miami a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nSo what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection that he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just to add to understand what accounts for the differences between us\nWe kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with [laughter] okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings\nHave debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from so slight Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and I meant that a lot
