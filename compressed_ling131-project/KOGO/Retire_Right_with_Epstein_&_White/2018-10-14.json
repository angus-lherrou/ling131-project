book I think that a lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things\nOver the years I think I could look back um to college when you have a beer bottle of beer that found a twist off but you know having opener um but somebody always had a bit later on and I got taught\nA kind of the party trick or being able to to wedge a bottle of beer open with a lighter um and then you know\nToo late some others along the way and then you know like it was silly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make\nThis a book [laughter] the uh the big lighter that's if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against the tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um but illustration diagrams\nAnd everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a fulcrum um so it's all highly scientific as you can go\nRight [laughter] end up for those in desperation mode even folding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nI think yeah that's a great one

with a piece of string that you do an actual tone and awaiting it on fire [noise] um so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases\nOf creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer and you can turn it into a a glass of drinking glass to then put beer in um I'd recommend you know standing\nHeavily or just to protect your mouth I'm can create tiki torches or that you can put outside to\nWard off skew which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this uh mosquitoes

Security questions estate planning investments and more but this confidence of this retirement plan your plan is\nThe precipice of what you know what we do and what we want you to have and there's no cost there's no obligation you just simply need to call\nThe number is eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight once again eight eight eight five six four Seventy seven eight and you know just not to forget jet I Know you did this whole kind of point was brought up by the question of when you can retire right and that and it's such a popular question that is actually what I wrote a book about\nSo I wrote a book called the step by step guide and how to retire right um you can find it on Amazon but since you're listening to this radio show will also invite you to our website Epstein and white dot com you can actually download an emerging of that book for free\nSix easy steps and how to actually know your quote unquote magic number to know exactly how to go about building a retirement plan with that being said we certainly still invite you to come on in because you don't just have to read a book for this we will do the work for you\nYeah and let me just repeat the website folks and case that he missed it real simple you know Epstein and Andy white like the color dot com and there's a lot of passion that went into that book and a lot of a lot of skill and so you could just go to our website\nAnd download that book at no cost and I think you'll find it a quick read about one that'll really help you understand the key steps and how you build up a proper retirement and you could take that knowledge that you gain from that book\nCome on in here and see Dave Brat and the team here once again remind you all do Sherry's we all are held to the highest standard and what makes us even more rare fiduciary is a much smaller percentage of the advisory committee out there\nBut we're an independent judiciary which makes us that really small percentage of we have access to everything we have no big institution telling us what you should have and so we love that about our firm and our clients love that about us\nBecause they know the advice they get from empty and white as fully transparent with their best interests at all times focused on retirement so if you know people that are uh you know a little gray hair maybe a little less hair\nThat look kind of look like me to the gym we focus on and uh so that's that's you who I'm describing and you're within ten years like Bradley pointed out or you're right there on at the gate or you've already walked through the gate and pay checks of stock you might want to get this worked at\nThe whole scene here that we've been talking about is that [noise] that the most popular question we always get which is when can I retire ... should I retire and once again if you missed the first part of the show your retirement date the right date for you from a financial standpoint is the day you know under conservative assumptions you can generate the income you need for the rest of your life\nIt's that simple now how much you need to do that is different for everybody based off your situation and there's a lot of things that maximize a plan like proper Social Security advised taxation advice investment advice and we're going to go into those details a little bit more on the show but\nHow when you can retire as very simply when you can generate inconvenient for the rest of your life\nBut I also want to mention there are other dates that you want to think about in this there's other dates 'em that play an important factor into that\nYou know things like being age fifty nine and a half ... important as far as when you pull money out of things like your IRAs\nThat yes it's still taxable but once he reached fifty nine and a half you avoid the iris ten percent penalty but also by the way if you're fifty five are older you can actually do this with ... case so depending on when you're retiring there's some\nAdvice on what to do between four one K. is in IRAs and what you should do there a lot of people if you do have the pension remember that it might be much better at let's say sixty five sixty\nSo that's a real big consideration if you're looking to retire little earlier\nOn a house the by the uh hit that pension might be because that can add up to sometimes literally like a hundred thousand dollars or more over the course of your retirement all that income all those years we'll be careful their\nSocial Security of course in when you should take it as a big kind of different dates in time there we don't have time to spend the whole hour hearing today show of all the different rules and options of Social Security\nBut you can be missing out on switching techniques and spousal techniques if you try to do something before certain dates in time we also secure whether you're married or divorced retiring before sixty five these days leaves and medical questions so that's another dates that you'd want to be kind of keeping in mind is medical and what that might cost\nFamily dynamics play a part into this to you know we've had clients who maybe unfortunately have a parent who get sick or a family member who's sick\nAnd you know they they will retire maybe a few years earlier than they planned because it's important to look at life and to look at\nSpending time whether it's a spouse or a parent or kids sometimes we have clients whose kids maybe move states and they're having grandkids in other states\nAnd the thought of only seeing their grandkids once or twice a year is will crush them and and so they may move up a retirement date in order to adhere to a family dynamic there\nAnd one piece of advice to as not to put yourself in a position where the market controls the timing of your retirement a lot of people naturally wanted to retire around the year two thousand and eight but you know last maybe half of their accounts because they left their money invested way too aggressively so they had to delay retirement\nAnd that's another that's another really important consideration of a plan is to make sure that you don't leave yourself in a position where the market controls your date it's not a place you want to be in\nBradley everything you're saying is is dead on my friend and if the retirement income plan is what you're apps enough then I invite you to leave your checkbook at home\nCome in and meet with Brad and I and the rest of the team here and have seen a white and we'll building one for you and it's that
