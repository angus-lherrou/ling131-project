I'm going to be pretty direct with it no most people should not make a lot of mood and therefore when cattle right because most people don't know quite frankly what they're doing with their foreign gay decisions and that's not a flights on their most people would readily admit that\nRight when you think of a proper what should you do with things like your four one K. these are long term investments by nature right so if you're in your thirties and forties and maybe even early fifties and you know you've got at least ... years there's more to go when you should do is about once a year\nAnd really at most for a lot of people\n... and if it's not you please work with someone who can do this for you you know we have tons of clients who have four one K. is that we can't personally managed cause other companies but we have to look to help them\nYeah so once you get an idea of just your general kind of Asian timeframe and you know if you're in your thirties or fifties right you can be a little more aggressive in your thirties little less so is your fifties and older but\nJust create a general overall risk profile that makes sense have someone to help you look at the options in her four one K. and put together a diversified portfolio that can stand the test of time\nThat will over time be positions that you don't have to worry about trying to tweak and trying to time the market and try to do something back and forth 'cause statistically that doesn't work exactly once you get some help but just an overall diversified portfolio\nAnd you have that that person who knows what they're doing look at this around once a year for you\nThat's what most people should be doing now if you have looked at this in Twenty years right there is a very good chance you should be making some tweaks not necessarily because what the market's done the last couple of weeks but because your life a lot different than it was Twenty years ago and I had no one's looked at it so yeah there are probably some changes made fed\nAnd Braley you know how 'bout those four one K. is with people you know people that left a job with the previous company they left that four one K. there and you know that's\nAlso ... a big no no is is really you know consolidating way if you've left the company news left money behind and many of you listening have done something like that\nAre in so really getting getting these assets\nCombined maybe you can't rule that over into your ... your existing four one K. but getting that money rolled over into an IRA from a previous employer so you can actively get a advice either you're you're managing it or you're looking for an advisor and\nLots of choices out their folks of of the kinds of advisors there are so you know\nWe've we've found that you know from a lot of our clients experiences they've mentioned that when they call it kind of the one eight hundred number at their four one K. company whether it's a fatality or vanguard or principle\nThey legally are not supposed to give too much advice those all over the phone they're really just supposed to help kind of general questions that you'd ask about\nThe four one K. but they're not there to tell you hey based off your situation get out of this funding get into this one or do this instead of that right so you know here's one of the many things that comes with coming in and seen us here to obscene and white and coming in and getting erupting white retirement income master plan\nIf you've got current for one case for oh three B.

thanks rap manner show\nLet's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked this sell off\nWell it's a handful of things first of all and it's it's really taking place over three or four days so you know we're over a thousand pointed down on the Dow in a handful days here and this is scaring people and the question becomes a thinks it's going on and I'll give you an example\nThe first thing is that right struggling and you even heard the president talking about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is ranching rage actually been raising rates really doubt\nBut most recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can land they called the Federal Reserve fund to tour a quarter happening temper and when those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the cost of borrowing money goes up right so if you're going to borrow money\nFor a whole if you're going to refinance or if you're going to buy a car and you know financed that car\nOr you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where are your are owing money the cost to borrow that money is now going and that spoke spokes market right because if you're\nWell maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last show they'll buy less cars are those shop less what it costs more to borrow money\nThe markets kitsch boots that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed and rate going up now we have to put that in a little bit in the context because\nLet's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historically lower rates which had put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we're right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective\nUm and they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up the treasury the rates have gone up on that right now so right now the three your tenure treasuries over three point one five too is I speak\nThat means that you're going by ten year treasury are going to get a rate of three point one five percent\nAnd that's the highest rate we've seen on and your treasury unlike seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happening and then there's the fact that attack market has been way like it's right let me see no cell often tech stocks\nParticularly tech stocks though\nI'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interests\nThere's been some data breaches with companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach and so there's been some soften these tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market higher\nCompany you know we call him fang companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google News main tech companies\nHave been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably about time for us to see tech stocks pull back and I think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um\nAll this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally the global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been\nAbsolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world\nUm and so we you know us pulling back a little bit\nCompared to what's happening abroad um it's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging markets have been down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a breather to an almost\nA recognized that things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nTo several components leading to this precipitous drop on Wall street David I Want to go back to those rising rates I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment and you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money markets and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and if in most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rights again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is for retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is in the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what I what I Know and and we've been talking\nAbout this and maybe you know I've done other interviews on this\nUm I Know that we're we've ... we've just had the greatest full market of our lifetime\nI I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course\nToday more wealth than you've ever had\nAnd at the same standpoint the last two months I've been telling people don't get greedy [noise] right like don't now is not the time to get greedy now's not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money\nBecause if you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you're retired\nYour ... your comfort level was seeing your money drops significantly is going to be lower\nSo it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement order or you're already retired that you talked with a financial advisor that you work with a
