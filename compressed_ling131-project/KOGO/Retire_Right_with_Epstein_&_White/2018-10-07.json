decisions you were making the role of your money it's all going to change once you leave your job then you start heading back down the mountain and\nI mentioned it Brad real briefly some of the risks that I wasn't really prepared for and my recent experience doing this coming back down the mountain some of the risks and we think about our our money in retirement are kind of obvious stock market risky to health care long term care\nBut there are others that can kind of sneak up on things like inflation or even taxes\nMaybe you don't see those liabilities coming at ya\nHow do you help somebody

you take all the financial assets that somebody has\nSocial Security's pensions four O. one K. is iris\nIs and then you really get an idea of well how much income do you need right what is your budget each month what kind of goals do you have for vacations or to help\nKids out or legacy goals afterwards and you start dissecting and then when you build this plan the second time we meet with you then

you can just be leaving basically free money your own money\nAnd they have all those years believing that on the table and missing it 'cause you don't know these strategies and that's great and that's what's all security experts knows the strategies but you could still choose ... incorrectly if you don't take your investments in your taxes and other things in consideration so we host Social Security events every month like clockwork here two different nights\nAre typically Wednesdays and Thursdays but all you needed to do is go to Epstein in white dot com so once again Epstein and white

Social Security benefit that she had a three three hundred and twenty some odd dollars a month all the way to eleven hundred\nWhich she was living with him was life changing and so there's so many

the big what ed sad you head into retirement there are a lot of things you need to think about before you just jump in their entire made where you won't have that steady paycheck anymore\nIs that we're we're talking today Brad area where sharing a little bit earlier about some of the things that get overlooked I think one of those what asked for a lot of people is certainly Social Security what if I take this wrong or what if my benefits aren't what they thought they were going to be\nYou have a story to share with us about how you and Dave were able to help somebody a figure something out with their Social Security and I wonder if you just start off this segment sharing that with us\nYeah absolutely so um we have this woman come to one of our Social Security events which I mention the last segment we host Social Security events every month you just simply go to our website obscene in white dot com and you'll see our vents page\nWhen these next events are and you can register for them so she had come to the man 'cause that was kind of one of her main you know financial questions in her world is what to do about Social Security\nShe'd been retired for a couple of years\nAnd um had been very successful just a very successful um three of our employment for for many many years\nAnd had built up a she had a couple of pensions that she was fortunate enough to earn and between the pensions and she had saved up again very very good saver ... IRA four one K. cows and non Ira accounts and our trust as well and what she's been doing for the last couple of years since she's been retired as the\nBetween the pensions and a lot of evidence an interest from stocks and bonds in her non Iraq how she's been able to generate enough dividends and interest or to stack on top of the pension that that's pretty much been meeting her needs and that's what she's been living off for the last couple of years and she's in her mid sixties currently\nAnd so you know and she's got a very healthy Social Security a very very good so scared about as good as it gets kind of this has been the underlying question of you know I don't necessarily need it right now because the pensions and dividends and interest\nI could take it right now but I get a big growth rate you know my Social Security will grow at eight percent per year from sixty six to Seventy and for her that's a big growth rate and\nWell it will I just was it worth it for me the way I just don't know where it's that's what leads her to come to the event and I know for a lot of you listening that's pretty much what happens for most of us you know what how should I take my Social Security and when should I take it and in a very common and I'm sure that's what you're thinking of is your own situation is as we talk about her so when you look at an entire plan\nFirst blush you might sit there and go wow you know her Social Security is going to grow so much as she waits so remind us you know we let's wait all the way till Seventy let's maximize this thing and yoga is much more ... than we did it\nAnd when you do an analysis of Social Security in a vacuum you know if she were live 'til nine years old or more and she's in good health there's no reason to think she won't she'd get hundred thousand dollars or more of something like a hundred thousand dollars of more of extra still pretty over life that she waited till Seventy\nAnd white dot com or call right now give you a number and you can get right on the manifest and that number's eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight once again eight eighty five six four Seventy seven eight\nMore retirement

show today if you hear something you'd like to get some answers on let me tell you how you can reach the team that scene in my retirement income solutions\nIt's by calling this number eight eight eight five six four Seventy eight Seventy eight once again that is eight five six four Seventy eight Seventy eight we're talking today about some of the big what is as you head into retirement it's important to identify what they are\nAnd to figure out how to be ready for them and Brad we've you know I shared my story earlier about the dissent coming down from a recent\nMountain climbing trap the dissent with a lot harder than I thought it was going to be and I ran into some risks I wasn't really fully preparing for and it was scary seeing just how far I could fall\nAnd we talk about how far we can fall financially the grass is some sort of drop in the market so let's talk about what are some of the white ... the markets China time the markets and what can we do too had some of this off\nYeah this is always one of the scariest things for 'em investment advisors like David I is is just the amount of times that we here at any given week or month a year you know average people that aren't as professionals\nSeeing a headliner hearing something not truly understanding the full picture and using that as some gauge of what they're going to do with their investments meaning get into the markets or get out\nRight AKA market timing and I'm here to tell you it doesn't work um market timing doesn't work it doesn't work for some of the best professionals in the entire world and it's certainly not going to work you know for the average person and just as you know\nYou know if it I mean think about\nThe trillions and trillions of dollars of technology and algorithms and the smartest people in the world to try to do this all day long and you've never heard of so there's nobody out there that you've heard of that just consistently times and beats the markets over the long term right you've heard about\nRight ... and we hear stories sometimes as someone kind of making a move and let's just call it kind of lucky and let's just call it what it is like well I did this and uh yeah I got out right before that happened and it's like well if I played a hundred and ten your part three against Dustin Johnson and I had one beautiful shot and he happened to not and I\nYou know beat him on one individual really easy whole like that may theoretically happened it's still hard to believe don't around about right and it's likely but it could technically highly I'm going to happen right I can get lucky on that one individual get lucky five play eight I've ... I've seen you get ... especially on Dot Earth actually look over skill any day might have been\nWhat am I fully Eighteen holes against them there's ... zero then it goes down to an actual zero chance\nAbsolutely not right you can't beat the stuff over the long term in your average person re that's a great analogy Bradley that's so true\nAnd there's just a really basic stuff sometimes that I think people\nDon't understand and again there are still using this as information to try to time the markets as an example just kind of\nWell the markets higher and what goes up must come down you know we hear that all the time like well the market's been an all time highs the markets high so clearly it's got to come down and I'm going to wait for the market to come down I've been hearing people say I'm gonna wait for the rocket fuel for years now yeah and what you've done has missed out on tremendous years yeah\nMm the price of the market doesn't tell you the value of the market whether it's cheaper expensive first and foremost right because the price of the market might go up but remember the markets based off company earnings right this isn't like a mythical stock market these are just businesses these are companies companies and companies generate earnings\nAnd if earnings grow a ton of earnings keep growing and growing and growing\nThen the ... market itself could actually go up but be cheaper\nNo I'm not saying that any particular moment that that automatically means the market's going up or down because once again the theme is we don't know but right off the bat a lot of people have never been educated that just because the markets hired doesn't mean it's more expensive so I Want you to think about that\nA lot of other rhetoric that that's been happening a lot for a little while now is are we in the late stages of our cycle as the as the cycle over as the economic cycle over\nAnd nobody ever knows that entirely right there's a lot of what's called leading indicators and a lot of things that economic ... you know economist in a market professionals use and you and you know these things are important that professionals use then\nIt helps make predictions but nothing's perfect but one thing that our own portfolio manager taught us day that I really like that and you know where I'm going with this as he was looking at ... you know let's say we are kind of at a peak right let's say we're kind of in the peak cycler late version of a cycle\nYou know in his word and our and our portfolio manager David ... hours whereas just because you're late and an economic cycle doesn't mean it's over brierley and he took a look back at 'em all these periods in history where earnings growth had Pete and then how long it took for an actual recession\nAnd there were about a dozen times from Nineteen fifty three three two thousand and four um that he looked at about a dozen and if you looked at the average amount of time it took\nWhere the economic cycle in earnings peaked until the recession that was the average was forty nine months and some huge returns were made during that forty nine month the average return\nWas almost sixty percent fifty eight point nine percent over that span over that forty nine month average fan right in other words if you look backwards at all these dozen times where we can look back and see the things that peaked\nIt still took an average of forty nine months and if you were pulled out of the market just because quote unquote earning to get a missed out on the fifty eight point nine percent return over those fall in months\nSo just because their names of peaked and we pointed that out does that mean automatically now we've got forty nine great months ahead no 'cause every different\nRight I just told you the average over that decade there is one time from September of Nineteen eighty one is one earnings Pete and we didn't have a recession Islam Nineteen Ninety in July\nThat's a hundred and three months that it took\nAnd the market would up two hundred and eight percent right now conversely June of two thousand\nWas another period of time are earning to Pete and it took only nine months until march of two thousand and one right when everything and the market went down fourteen twenty percent that time and then continue downloaded for a couple more years so these are some of the smartest stats you'll ever find right and there's so much that goes into tracking all these things and looking at the stats and ...\nAnd even then one time and took a hundred and three months and two hundred and eight percent returns another time it took only nine months first session and the market lost money I mean I just don't know and that's what it how it certainly helps to have your own short but since we've been\nTalking about going up and down the mountain so where we use\nIt's in the markets at any given time or economic cycle right now there are a lot of positive things about the economy a lot of arguments to be made that for a couple of years we could still see a lot of great growth and you don't want to let anyone headline or the market quote unquote being hired just automatically make you think you need to get out of ... you also don't want to sit there and just be complacent\nRight and uh we have seen a lot of complacency because the market's been so good for nine or ten years now that people just have seen their accounts rise and\nPeople forget that at some point whether that's nine months from now or a hundred month from now at some point it does come down the point being is you need a plan\nYou need your retirement income plan that not only builds you this custom plan\nWhich we do for you and will do for you at no cost or no obligation that shows you your income for your life shows you that you can't read out of money gives you that peace of mind handles inflation free teaches you how to maximize your Social Security\nYour pensions tax efficiencies but how about an actual investment plan now where you take your goals and your risk tolerance is in your comfort level in a consideration\nAnd went to start designing different investments for you that are meant to help protect you when the market goes down and still try to make some money beat inflation along the way and other accounts other areas of your investment plan where it is okay to be on the market and we've got a long term plan a place where we don't have to worry about market timing and that will also work too\nSo the ... Epstein of white retirement income master plan that's what would we have done for hundreds and hundreds of people over that's what we would love to do for you there is no cost there is no obligation is going to be a sit down first where we get to know you get to know what your situation is currently what questions yeah what goals you're trying to accomplish truly just tried to get to know what's important to you and then we're going to see what we can do to help", "show_name": "Retire Right with Epstein & White", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "07"}
