coms thanks for joining us today on retire right with that scene in white I'm generally jak alongside Dave Epstein and Brad white and bread I appreciate that story talking about your wife and the work she's put into preparing to become an instructor you know my my daughter's a runner and when she first\nStarted cross country she would show up at a race and would just keep up with the flow try to do with the other kids were doing and she'd do okay but she wasn't winning medals because there was some strategy that was missing so we bought her a watch so she can keep track of her pace and she can be more strategic about how fast you needed to be going and when she should\nPick up the pace a little bit that's when she started to get more competitive and she started to earn some metals it improved hurricane Dave I think there are some parallels there to having a strategy for your retirement income and and having a spending plan and retirement right\nOh boy bingo Gen that's what it is in retirement folks income income income is not this big orange number of floating over your head in the form of a lump sum in what you're trying to get to a gang it's really just what how much money do you need on a monthly basis to live your life Bradley\nAny modify it's on the planes do suggest that's really interesting that you said the right if it's when you you're giving your your daughter kind of a score card right that you know as a runner this this watches a score card so that she could have these checks and balances these metric she's trying to hit\nAnd she's not worried about turning a even a mile and a five minute mile she's worried about getting maybe ten seconds better two seconds better each race right actually write out accountability\nWe see that a lot in financial planning where people will come in for the first time let's say they haven't retired yet\nAnd they want to retire five years from now or ten years from now and when we run an analysis and it says okay this is how much income you're looking for today this is how much you'll need a retirement this will allow you to do all the goals that you've talked about and live the retirement of your dreams here's how much you have now if you can say this much per year between now and then you will be perfectly on track\nAnd something amazing happens when we do that is when we first of all people now they do it right instead of like well I remember checking something percentage and my four one K. awhile ago we're\nWe've got this money that's kind of piled up in a checking account I don't really know where it came from or what to do with it now that's kinda how most of us walk around and we haven't done a plan and all of a sudden in my example if it's hey save this much and saving and this place and here's what we're going to save it into\nAnd here's what it's going to turn into which is what's going to fund your plan the amazing that happens is when we see these people again you know six months later a year later there there are so proud of this accountability the score card right it's this\nGuy's just wanting to know why I did it right All right have you told me I needed to say this much right promote this year so this is what I put in you can see that so far away and put her dressing count right like\nI just want to get that review was still on track right on it\nIt's more of an excitement and people you're you it it just feels so much there's such a peace of mind\nOf knowing why you're doing what you're doing and what it's going to mean so I really love that example Gen of ... I don't know if you can share maybe if that's how your your daughter felt a little bit too once you put that watch on her wrist of if she was kind of coming home with more of a smile of hey I I accomplish this time or I beat this time of that yeah it was all for her to that\nAbsolutely what it was and you know the other thing when there's a race going on her coach is going to be in different places throughout that race just giving her a little bit more encourage meant making sure she knows she's on the right track and giving her a little piece of advice and that's it that's so similar to what you and Dave are able to do also 'cause you're right there throughout the whole game\nJust given a little bit more advice given a little bit more tweaks right\nYet I gave the example of of someone who maybe had retired yet and that kind of scorecard is what they need to do to get their day your example that you started on was was maybe more of a common example for a lot of our clients who are already retired which is the scorecard of hey here's how much you can spend each and every year right and actually what happens on the reverse of what I just mentioned is people are\nTerrified sometimes to pull money out of their accounting retirement\nAnd it causes them to not even enjoy I mean look you spend your entire life trying to work and build all of this up so that it could carry you through retirement and not being able to enjoy what you've said because you're worried about the future and they don't have a plan running out of money is the number one fear Bradley and that's what you're speaking to my friend\nYeah and you know this time you know I I you know certain times of year I Would say\nYou know let's say closer to like the end of a given year the middle end of a given year we might reviewed have a review of someone who said look you supposed to pull out this much over the course of the year and you've only pulled out this much so far\nAs I Know and let's talk through this why a little bit and if they are nervous of scared that planned like you said we're that coach or now it a little different part of the race\nOr still holding that hand each and every quarter and every year to retirement to let people know why it's okay to pull this money on and spend it why they're invested the way they are and what the taxes are going to be not to worry about it or you know all the above\nPerfectly said probably have folks retirement isn't the finish line it's the starting line is to start as a race\nAnd as Jim was talking about her daughter and her long distance racing that's that's what retirement is this a long distance race is is the start and we want to help you get out of the gate and and run that race your very best race okay and run with confidence that you know you're going to have an enjoyable ride and you're going to have an enjoyable retirement\nAnd here's a phone number to help you get that started his eight eight eight five six

more time planning for vacation then they spend planning for retirement because planning for a vacation is a little easier it's a shorter period of time and it's more fun Brad retirement planning for most of us anyway is not very much fun as\nWell let me ask you this and when you think of planning for a vacation and why is that fun\nWell because I'm thinking about all the fun things I'm going to do\nAnd when you think of retirement planning why does that sound not fun\nBecause I'm so busy worried about the accounts in the investments and am I doing this right\nBingo so this little word association game I think is really happening for ... up there right is that it's a dreary meeting about budgeting and taxes and mutual funds and right now I don't know I get when you were to happen\nI

you're didn't sort of off the road right right right I guess right when we talk about this so that's a mistake that is not what you should think of when you think of the word retirement planning\nIn fact you know this reminds me so I was sitting with a a current client of ours I think it was last week and he's been applying for a few years since his late fifties\nHe likes but he does he's happy you know he's somewhat excited at the concept of retirement planning being a few years away like most people are right it's something to be excited about it should be certainly um but you know he

solutions\nEpstein and white dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more and Dave I've seen some retirement planning story that mentioned the health and welfare connection do you think there's much to that\nI Do that and I I'll just use use myself as as an example to that\nYou know I'm I'm now in my sixties many of you listening to me can identify with being in your sixties and or or approaching\nAnd got a lot of life experiences you know a lot of things that\nAre dying and I made some good decisions along the way and and certainly you know we're not perfect day you know we we could have made some better decisions too and probably one of the best decisions I think I could look back to uh just here over this last year Jen is just just doing a better job at paying attention to Dave Epstein\nIn his own you know and and living a healthier lifestyle and not being so consumed by my work and so\nBeing a better manager of my time and taking that that time\nAnd doing something healthy and for me at this stage in my life what's been what feels that the most fun and rewarding is swimming and and so uh you know I've I've gotten into the pool we've gotta fortunately not far from the building here we\nAre hearing scripts ranch we have a a really nice a local club it's the swimming racket club scripts ranch and and uh we we were able to join as a family and a\nTwo minutes from the office I can be changing my ... out of my suit into my trunks and and in the pool I go and now you know I I Will tell you you're a year later I could swim fifty laps and when I say lapsed\nThere and back and it's a twenty five meter pool and I and I do that in about an hour's time nonstop\nAnd I you know when I first I Would get I Would get ten Fifteen lapse in and I'd have to stop but over time over time I got stronger and stronger\nThan the pounds started to to to drift away and so now you know year yeah I still I you know I I still can lose a few more pounds but I'm I'm Down about twelve pounds I feel much stronger I feel like I my strength and in in my mind feels you know that much clear you know I think that's the\nThe the healthy aspect of when we we do good things to for ourselves physically\nYou know just so many things seemed to fall into place and so you know I could completely identify you know my health to my wealth and so you know when we we take the time to to take good you know to take care of ourselves especially when we get into our\nTo this stage of our lives you know we we just know that there's we only got so much of this time left in in ... you know I I I could use this one story that\nYou know our the pastor of the church that we go to you know head as he brought out his wife's measuring his her sewing tape and it was a hundred and thirty five inches long and so you know well we we if we just look at each inch in in a way of years jet you know well we know we're not going to live a hundred and thirty five years so he\nCut off took out a pair of scissors and cut off thirty five years\nAnd and now he's got a hundred inches left well you know if it's possible we can live to be a a centenarian we could live to be an age one hundred but really normal normal life expectancy you know if you're if you're a man is maybe now in your early mid mid eighties and and if you're a woman maybe longer so he cut off or\nAnother you know in women you know not unlikely women get into their nineties now so that has a lot to do with retirement planning I'll get to in a moment\nSo he cut a another chunk off this this measuring tape and now\nNow we got you know maybe Ninety of of the hundred and thirty five inches left and so where are you know well if you're sixty years old\nWell let's cut off that sixty and so now I'm holding up this thirty inch piece of this wet originally sounded out or started out as a hundred and thirty five inches now this this thirty inches you know what are you going to do with that\nNow will forever at church you know is that you know what\nAll about you know you know how you get it how you gonna do use those best that that Thirty years that you might have left how can you use that best in in serving serving you know God and and everybody around you in retirement you know as you you have this thirty inches left you know how have you prepared\nYourself to be the best steward of all the IV safety and health wealth it's all about being good stewards yeah you know a good steward to your health so when you are and retirement and his rally at an earlier segment had mentioned you know it's not that\nIt's not the finish line folks when ... retirement begins\nIts the starting line and you don't and when you like to have that retirement\nBe healthy during that and and sometimes you know life throws a curve ball and and maybe we've done that our best to control that and and just\nGosh things happen with no explanation you know life happens and sometimes health is\nOut of our control but a wealth is in your control folks wealth is in ... in your control and and Bradley alluded to that and and we do that every week we talk about you know planning don't don't be one of those that procrastinate because maybe you've made some maybe not the best decisions in the past jet\nAnd and that's causing you for whatever reason to feel embarrassed about where you where you are and you're planning and I got to tell you folks that have seen a white this is the no embarrassment zone Dave and ... and the team here\nHas seen it all and we don't want you to feel that way we want you
