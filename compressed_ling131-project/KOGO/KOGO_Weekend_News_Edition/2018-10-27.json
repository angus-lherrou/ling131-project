anything that we we haven't seen so don't let that hold you back cause you to procrastinate once again the phone number eight eighty five six four seven eight seven eight\nWe're talking today with Dave ... and Brad white that scene in white retirement income solutions I'm generally jak alongside Epstein in white dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more\nGuys for those who are concerned about volatility they're concerned about how they are\n... what what types of investments that they have gained how hands on should we be with things like our four one K. and our IRA should we be in there trying to make changes when we start to see volatility or how do you recommend people handle but how hands on should they be\nWell that's a great question and that is you know for many many four one K. participants you know you know where they getting the right advice I as to be in what positions inside their four one K. are\nOften they're Gen they're looking at historical performances you know the one year the three years or five you're in the ten year and and they're basing their selections as to which ones have done the best right and and so gosh there's so many ways to mess up\nRight and how you will elect\nYou know those choices within your four one K. it really has to have a a a real relationship of those elections has to where you are in in in your retirement a red zone argue inside the red zone or you inside this and fully years or less or even closer\nOr you farther away and you know there's so much to consider their Bradley this this is really a great question that gymnast\nHere's how I Would answer Jen I'm I'm going to be pretty direct with it you know most people should not make a lot of moods and therefore when cattle right ... because most people don't know quite frankly what they're doing with their foreign kid decisions and that's not a flights on that most people would readily admit that\nRight when you think of a proper what should you do with things like your four one K. these are long term investments by nature right so if you're in your thirties and forties and maybe even early fifties and you know you've got\nAt least ... years or more to go when you should do is about once a year and really at most for a lot of people\n... and if it's not you please work with someone you can do this for you you know we have tons of clients who have for one case that we can't personally manage because other companies but we have to look to help them so once you get an idea of just your general kind of Asian timeframe and you know if you're in your thirties or fifties right you could be a little more aggressive in your thirties little less so is your fifties an older but\nJust create a general overall risk profile that makes sense have someone to help you look at the options in your four one K. and put together a diversified portfolio that can stand the test of time\nThat will over time be positions that you don't have to worry about trying to tweak and trying to time the market and try to do something back and forth 'cause statistically that doesn't work exactly once you get some help but just an overall diversified portfolio\nAnd you have that that person who knows what they're doing look at this around once a year for you that's what most people should be doing now if you haven't looked at this in Twenty years right there is a very good chance you should be making some tweaks not necessarily because what the market's done the last couple of weeks but because\nYour life a lot different than it was Twenty years ago and right and no one's looked at it so yeah there are probably some changes made fed and\nBradley you know how 'bout those four one K. is with people you know people that left ... a a job with the previous company they left that four one K. there and you know that's\nThat's also folks a big no no is is really you know consolidating way if you've left a company that you've left money behind in many of you listening have done something like that\nOr and so really getting getting these assets\nCombined maybe you can't rule that over into your ... your existing four one K. but getting that money rolled over into an IRA from a previous employer so you can actively get a advice either you're you're managing it or you're looking for an advisor and\nLots of choices out their folks of the kinds of advisors there are so you know\nWe've we've found that you know from a lot of our clients experiences they've mentioned that when they call kind of the one eight hundred number at their four one K. company whether it's a fidelity or vanguard her principal\nThey legally are not supposed to give too much advice those ... all over the phone they're really just supposed to help kind of general questions that you'd ask about\nThe four one K. but they're not there to tell you hey based off your situation get out of this funding to get into this one or do this instead of that right so here's one of the many things that comes with coming in and seen a shared obscene and white and coming in and getting erupting white retirement income master plan\nIf you've got current for one case for oh three bees ts peas if you're currently working somewhere you can bring those in and we'll review them all talk to you about your overall situation at no cost you know we can help you take a look at what's in there and what we think is best for you and we'll do it in plain English\nAnd actually solve this for you right it's it's from what we've heard a much better experience than trying to get that done on a one eight hundred number no cost now if you're someone that has IRAs other accounts I'm old for one case we might be able to show you really how powerful doing a roll over consolidating\nAs well as opening up more investment options that don't exist inside those plans and that could be meaningful for you and we can teach you about those too\nSo you know this is really getting all the part of our process I'm going to give you a number here in a second and when you pick up the phone and call this number we're going to have a very lovely person who's going to answer your call they're going to take down just some basic information from you and then uh Dave abstain my partner here and president of ups in a way it's going to give you a call on Monday we're going to find some time\nUh that works for you and for us to get you into come see one of our specialist here and one of our advisors\nAre going to sit down with you and just really ask you what questions you have and about your situation\nWe're going to get a good idea of what what questions do you have in how we can help then we're going to build a custom comprehensive retirement plan for you if that's what we're looking for all analyze investments in four one K. is you have give you advice there\nAny tax advice we can find Social Security\nThe list goes on and there is zero cost the euro obligation for all of that I don't think we could have made us any easier and there's been so many people that have taken advantage of this not everybody necessarily becomes a long term client but we're proud to say that everybody has said it's been worth their time to come in and there's at least a couple of things we've been able to do to help\nThat's what we hangar hats on here and that's really our mission and that's what we love to do\nSo again that's all you need to do is call and that number is eight eight eight\nFive six four seven eight seven eight once again it eight eight five six four

since February\nA big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street\nAnd David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah\nDavid been out there and teaching America about money for more than two decades he's nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finish rich and smart women finish rich and today he's co founder of a even wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze\nDavid wealth than we are thrilled to have you with us today\nMagazine it's great to be with you even though you know it's a little ugly in the markets it's still great to be with you thanks rap manner show\nLet's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\nWell it's a handful of things first of all and it's it's really taken place over three or four days so you know we're over a thousand pointed down on the Dow in a handful days here and this is scaring people and and so the question becomes all their ... going on and I'll give you a sample during\nThe first thing is that rates are going up and you even heard the president talking about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear\nRates are going up and that is raising rage actually been raising rates really two thousand teen\nBut most recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can land they called the Federal Reserve fund rate to tour a quarter happened temper and when those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the cost of our money goes up right so if you're going to borrow money\nFor a whole if you're going to refinance your home if you're going to buy a car and you're going to finance that car\nOr you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where are your are owing money\nThe cost to borrow that money is now going up and that spoke spokes market right because if you're maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last show they'll buy less cars are those shop less what it costs more to borrow money\nThe markets and spoke to the consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed and rate going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like\nYou know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historically the rates that put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective\nUm and they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which has rates have gone up\nThe can your treasury the rates have gone up on that right now so right now the three or the tenure treasuries over three point one five to as I speak\nThat means that you're going by ten year treasury are going to get a rate of three point one five to ... percent and that's the highest rate we've seen on your treasury unlike seven years so that's\nAlso a very interesting thing that's happening and then there's the fact that attack market hasn't weighed like right let me see that we sell often tech stocks\nParticularly tech stocks though\nI'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches with companies involved like Amazon potentially data breach and Facebook at a recent data breach so to soften the tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market hire\nCompanies you know we call him saying companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google these main tech companies\nHave been actually on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit I'm not that surprising and it was probably about time for us to see X. box pull back and I think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um\nAll this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact global the global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy it's just been on fire we have been absolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world\nUm and so we you know us pulling back a little bit\nCompared to what's happening abroad um is really in a lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a breather to an almost a recognized that things are slowing down globally\nPartially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nTo several components leading to this precipitous drop on Wall street David I Want to go back to those rising rates I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nHe's [noise] you know\nYou're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way we'll pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment and you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit card or to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement than the good news about rich going higher\nIs that the rate on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and it and most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think are actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is for retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market drop I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of the market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what what I Know and we've been talking about this and maybe\nYou know I've done other interviews on this um I Know that we're we've we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime\nI I Know that if you've been in the markets even after the recession hadn't even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today more wealth than you've ever had\nAnd at the same standpoint the last two months I've been telling people don't get greedy [noise] I don't know it's not time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired\nIt's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pullback you can't afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you're retired [noise]\nYour your comfort level with seeing your money drops significantly is going to be lower\nSo it's really important I I just can't stress enough that when you're approaching retirement order or you're already retired that you talk with a financial adviser that you work with a financial wise or if that if you have a financial was right now that you pick up the phone and\nIt was breaking news station news radio six hundred ago\nNews radio six hundred co go live local breaking\n\nYoda what should I Do with the land cruiser I don't\nDo this right right now you can donate your vehicle to the national federation of line by calling eight six six to eight to Seventy three twenty seven eight six six to eight to Seventy three twenty seven or if you know a blind person who needs help please email and sb ... and that's the word a tax deduction\nWill receive and it doesn't take the force to be charitable [noise]\nWalking back to the Rick elements show I've told you that are public television special is coming out in November mind over money it's also a seminar

country you get the full seminar schedule at ... dot com Fifteen dollars a person twenty five a couple a and of course it's free on public TV if the programs going to err on your local market and it's really important because we are human creatures\nWere emotional right not intellectual in our behavior as much as we'd love to believe are smart intelligent intellectual we act emotionally and that is what causes us to make that investment decisions which is why we buy and sell low even though we know we're supposed to be doing the opposite\nIn this seminar mind over money it's a ton of fun lots of audience interaction games quizzes you'll be amazed the mistakes you make even though you're determined not to make them and you'll learn the science behind your emotions\nAnd most importantly the

even register over the phone\nIf you like I've got great\nNews if your kid is headed to college for the first time in decades according to the College Board the cost of college this year went\nDown [noise] this is the first time in over twenty five years that the average cost of tuition declined at both public and private colleges are you ready for how much prices fell\nOne hundred dollars crazy we didn't want to get to have well okay let's not get terribly excited but look I mean college costs have been rising seven percent per year on average for the past twenty five years according to the College Board and now\nPrices were flat they didn't rise seven percent which means of college was going to cost you twenty five grand it's twenty five grand one hundred as opposed to seven percent increase of thousands of dollars so this is really very exciting news and demonstrating\nSlow but sure\nThat college is becoming more affordable I Believe are going to see this trend continue we already have colleges that are freezing tuition we have private schools that are offering to charge with public schools pay we have out of state schools charging with in states students pay\nWe had states that are providing free tuition half a dozen of them so far around the country we have companies that are providing free tuition as an Employee Benefit Disney Chrysler gee uh see I uh we have Walmart and\nStarbucks all offering free tuition for employees it's really very exciting it doesn't mean you don't need to be saving for College of course you do the good news is the amount of money the parents have saved for college in college five twenty nine plans has had an all time high of more than three hundred twenty eight billion dollars [noise]\nA lot of money to the problem is for college savings\nPlans network the average account is only twenty four thousand dollars yeah that's not going to pay for college for your kid and oh by the way less than half of parents who have a child headed to college less than half a parents\nAre saving and a five twenty nine plan so none of the parents are saving for college not enough for setting in the right place and not enough for sending enough money [noise] so yeah college costs it looks like they're stabilizing but that's not enough to do the deal so um I Hope you're paying attention to that and I want to share with you the best\nWay to go to college that anyone anywhere has ever figure it out\nAnd it's been designed a poster child for this was a woman named Martha ... she was profiled in the media not long ago\nShe goes to Harvard and she doesn't pay anything\nFor tuition at Harvard she doesn't pay anything\nFor room and board you know why because she goes to Harvard\nBut she's not a student\nShe works in the
