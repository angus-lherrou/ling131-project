advice live you can go to our best tab on the Web site we host educational events all year long and you can see the different topics and the different ones coming up and how to register\nThat website again is Epstein and white dot coms thanks for joining us today on retire right with obscene and whites and generally jak alongside Dave Epstein and Brad white and bread I appreciate that story talking about your wife\nAnd the work she's put into preparing to become an instructor you know my my daughter's a runner and when she first started cross country she would show up at a race and would just keep up with the flow try to do with the other kids were doing and should do okay but she wasn't winning medals because there were some strategy that was nothing so we bought her a watch so she can keep track of her\nPace and she can be more strategic about how fast you needed to be going and when she should\nPick up the pace a little bit that's when she started to get more competitive and she started to earn some metals it improved hurricane Dave I think there are some parallels there to having a strategy for your retirement income and and having a spending plan in retirement right\nOh boy bingo Gen that's what it is in retirement folks income income income is not this big orange number of floating over your head in the form of a lump sum in what you're trying to get to a gang it's really just what how much money do you need on a monthly basis to live your life\nBradley anyone if I had something to do so Gen that's really interesting they said that right it's it's when you you're giving your your daughter kind of a score card right that you know as a runner this this watches a score card so that she could have these checks and balances these metric she's trying to hit\nAnd she's not worried about turning eight minute mile into a five minute mile she's worried about getting maybe ten seconds better two seconds better each race right actually write about accountability\nWe see that a lot in financial planning where people will come in for the first time let's say they haven't retired yet\nAnd they want to retire five years from now or ten years from now and when we run an analysis and it says okay this is how much income you're looking for today this is how much you'll need a retirement this will allow you to do all the goals that you've talked about and live the retirement of your dreams here's how much you have now if you can say this much per year between now and then you will be perfectly on track\nAnd something amazing happens when we do that is when we first of all people now they do it right instead of like well I remember checking something percentage and my four one K. awhile ago where we've\nGot this money that's kind of piled up in a checking account I don't really know where it came from or what to do with it now that's kind of how most of us walk around and we haven't done a plan and all of a sudden in my example if it tastes saved this much and saving and this place and here's what we're going to save it into\nAnd here's what it's going to turn into which is what's going to fund your plan the amazing that happens is when we see these people again you know six months later a year later there there are so proud of this accountability the scorecard right it's this\nGuy's just wanting to know what I did it right All right you told me I needed to say this much right promote this year so this is what I put in you can see that so far we put her dressing count right like\nI just want to get that review was still on track right on it\nIt's more of an excitement and people if you're you it it just feels so much there's such a peace of mind\nOf knowing why you're doing what you're doing and what it's going to mean so I really love that example ... I don't know if you can sure maybe if that's how your your daughter felt a little bit too once you put that watch on her wrist of if she was kind of coming home with more of a smile of hey I I accomplish this time or I beat this time of that yeah sold for her to\nThat absolutely what it was and you know the other thing when there's a race going on her coach is going to be in different places throughout that race just giving her a little bit more encouragement making sure she knows she's on the right track and given her a little piece of advice and that's that's so similar to what you and Dave are able to do also 'cause you're right there throughout the whole game\nJust given a little bit more advice given a little bit more tweaks right\nYet I gave the example of of someone who maybe had retired yet and that kind of scorecard is what they need to do to get their day your example that you started on was was maybe more of a common example for a lot of our clients who are already retired which is a scorecard of hey here's how much you can spend each and every year right and actually what happens on the reverse of what I just mentioned is people are\nTerrified sometimes to pull money out of their accounts and retirement and it causes them to not even enjoy you spend your entire life trying to work and build all of this up so that it could carry you through retirement and not being able to enjoy what you've said because you're worried about the future and they don't have a plan\nRunning out of money is the number one fear Bradley and that's what you're speaking to my friend\nYeah and you know this time you know I I you know certain times of year I Would say you know let's say closer to like the end of a given year in the middle end of a given year we might leave you have a review of someone said look you were supposed to pull out this much over the course of the year and you've only pulled out this much so far\nAs I Know and let's talk through this why a little bit and if they are nervous or scared that planned like you said we're that coach or now it a little different part of the race\nOr still holding that hand each and every quarter and every year to retirement to let people know why it's okay to pull this money out and spend it why they're invested the way they are and what the taxes are going to be not to worry about it or you know all the above\nPerfectly said proudly hey folks retirement is at the finish line it's the starting line is to start as a race\nAnd as Jen was talking about her daughter and her long distance racing that's that's what retirement is this a long distance race this is the start and we want to help you get out of the gate and and run that raise your very best race okay and run it with confidence that you know you're going to have an enjoyable run you're going to have an enjoyable retirement\nAnd here's a phone number to help you get that started is eight eight eight five six four Seventy seven eight

as\nWell let me ask you this and when you think of planning for a vacation and why is that fun\nWell because I'm thinking about all the fun things I'm going to do\nAnd when you think of retirement planning why does that sound not fun\nBecause I'm so busy worried about the accounts in investments and am I doing this right\nBingo so this little word association game I think is really happening

a little bit more and Dave I've seen some retirement planning story that mentioned the health and welfare connection do you think there's much to that\nI Do and I I'll just use use myself as as an example to that\nYou know I'm I'm now in my sixties many of you listening to me can identify with being in your sixties and or or approaching and got a lot of life experiences you know a lot of things that\nAre dying and I made some good decisions along the way and and certainly you know we're not perfect you know we we could have made some better decisions too and probably one of the best decisions I I think I could look back to ah just here over the last year Jen is just just doing a better job at paying attention to Dave Epstein\nIn his own you know and and living a healthier lifestyle and not being so consumed by my work and so\nBeing a better manager of my time in taking that that time\nAnd doing something healthy and for me at this stage in my life what's been what fills the the most fun and rewarding is swimming and and so uh you know I've I've gotten into the pool we've gotta fortunately not far from the building here we\nAre hearing scripts ranch we have a a really nice a local club it's the swimming racket club with scripts ranch and and uh we we were able to join as a family and a\nTwo minutes from the office I can be changing my ... out of my suit into my drunks and and in the pool I go and now you know I I Will tell you you're a year later I could swim fifty laps and when I say lapsed\nThere and back and it's a twenty five ... pool and I and I do that in about an hour's time nonstop\nAnd I you know when I first start up I Would get I Would get ten Fifteen lapse in and I'd have to stop but over time over time I got stronger and stronger\nThan the pounds started to to to drift away and so now you know year yeah I still I you know I I still can lose a few more pounds but I'm I'm Down about twelve pounds I feel much stronger I feel like I'm my strength and in my mind feels you know that much clear you know I think that's the\nThe the healthy aspect of when we we do good things to for ourselves physically\nYou know just so many things seemed to fall into place and so you know I could completely identify you know my health to my wealth and so you know when we we take the time to to take good you know to take care of ourselves especially when we get into our\nTo this stage of our lives you know we we just know that there's we only got so much of this time left in in ... you know I I could use this one story that\nYou know our the pastor of the church that we go to you know how does he brought out his wife's measuring has her sewing tape and it was a hundred and thirty five inches long and so you know well we we if we just look at each inch in in a way of years jet you know well we know we're not going to live a hundred and thirty five years so\nHe cut off took out a pair of scissors and cut off thirty five years\nAnd and now he's got a hundred inches laughed well you know if it's possible we can live to be a a centenarian we can live to be an age when a hundred but really normal normal life expectancy you know if you're if you're a man is maybe now in your early mid mid\nEighties and and and if you're a woman maybe longer so he cut off or another you know in women you know not unlikely women get into their nineties now so that has a lot to do with retirement planning I'll get to a moment\nSo he cut a another chunk off this this measuring tape and now\nNow we got you know maybe Ninety of of the hundred and thirty five inches left and so where are you know well if you're sixty years old\nWell let's cut off that sixty and so now I'm holding up this thirty inch piece of this wet originally sounded out or started out as a hundred and thirty five inches now this this thirty inches you know what are you going to do with that\nNow forever at church you know is that you know it was all about you know you know how you get it how you gonna do use those best that that Thirty years that you might have left how can you use that best in in serving serving you know God and and everybody around you in retirement\nYou know as you you have this thirty inches left you know how have you prepared\nYourself to be the best steward of all that you've saved and health wealth it's all about being good stewards yeah you know\nGood steward to your health so when you are and retirement and his rally at an earlier segment had mentioned you know it's not the\nIt's not the finish line folks when ... retirement begins it the starting line and you don't want it when you like to have that retirement\nBe healthy during that and and sometimes you know life throws a curve ball and and maybe we've done that our best to control that and and just gosh things happen with no explanation you know life happens and sometimes health is\nOut of our control but a wealth is in your control folks wealth is in ... in your control and and Bradley alluded to that and and we do that every week we talk about you know planning\nDon't don't be one of those that procrastinate because maybe you've made some maybe not the best decisions in the past ...\nAnd and that's causing you for whatever reason to feel embarrassed about where were you where you are in your planning and I got to tell you folks have seen a white this is the no embarrassment zone Dave Brat and the team here\nHave seen it all and we don't want you to feel that way we want you to we want to connect you with where you are today financially

having first the plant built then once you have the planned built much like the blueprint to a home then you know how to and where to invest your money and the most efficient way to minimize risk\nBecause when paycheck stop we have to minimize risk folks but we still need to make the returns\nTo have that best retirement to keep pace with inflation and ensure we don't run out of money and

by getting this work done that's what we plan on doing for you once again the phone number eight eight eight five six four seven eight seven eight go to Epstein in white dot com you'll find Bradley's\nGreat book there the step by step guide on how to retire right it's a free and you can also see our invents page education there's a whole life they're so Gen I can open the door any wider than I just it\nAbsolutely not I'll give you that phone number one more time if you missed it eight eight eight five six four Seventy eight Seventy eight or as Dave said a lot of great resources are also available on the website it's Epstein and white dot com or talking right now with Dave Brat about this health\nAnd welfare connection because your health isn't going to give you a whole lot of good without your wealth and your wealth isn't going to do a whole lot of good without your house they are certainly interconnected\nAnd check out her credit record because your son marrying her will inherit her credit record and that could hurt ability to buy a house as a newly married couple\nI'm Rick Edelman this is the truth about money triple a plan wreck here's an amazing statistic from the United nations forty percent four zero forty percent nearly half of all births in the United states now occur outside of wedlock\nForty percent of all the babies born in America are born to moms who are not married to the dads by the way that number forty percent in Nineteen Seventy it was ten percent\nThis is a massive change in American society and I want to ask you about the implications on estate planning\nOne of the legal rights and responsibilities what are you doing about properly naming airs because when you are married you have certain automatic rights under tax law and other federal statutes but when there is no marriage certificate and many of those rights\nDon't exist so you need to make sure if you were giving birth to a child to lose other parent you are not married\nYou need to make sure you're talking within the state attorney for the protection of yourself\nYour partner and most importantly the child\nOr taking telephone calls here on the Rick Adelman show heading out to Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nHi Rick I'm a a question or a is actually a\nMarket neutral funds um my wife and I are retired we're in her\nSixties uh you know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous but uh uh uh just concerned about preserving by uh\nUh what I've accumulated and I started researching these so called bark at neutral fun for a you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say and I guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah yeah I appreciate the question about the whole name is ... ... of a sales pitch it clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone\nWho is afraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounced themselves as market troll ... one of the earth is that supposed to mean and the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate\nA neutrality meaning that if the market goes down they're not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's ... that's a sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future so rather than trying to choose a sales pitch that his so called market neutral what we would simply out for instead\nIs diversification in other words don't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there to give you some opportunity to keep pace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money and bonds and yeah I have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nOr does make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money and lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs and foreign securities and government security is an oil and gas and real estate in exponential technologies\nAnd on and on and on so that is what we have found to be the best approach or effectively phrase it another way it's not the best approach\nIt's the least worst approach um because what we have really found it's kinda like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is the best way to invest so we choose the least worst which\nIs not making big bats so if you simply place a little bit of your money in a large array of investment opportunities you can help insulate yourself from losing a lot of money at any one time in any one asset class because you don't have all their money in any one class so\nThat makes sense for it they said yeah totally make that and uh you know thank you for talking the out of it uh because it didn't make sense to be\nAny time you come upon other similar kinds of questions just give us a call happy to help thanks so much\nYou're very welcome that Bob from Dana Point California here on the record all than show you can do it he didn't call us a triple a plan wreck you doing some analysis on Mitchell funds are you looking at investment opportunities we can be a really good sounding board to help you make sure you don't make a big mistake so let us take a look at your investments\nAnd in fact even better if you help us look at your investments\nBefore you buy them we are now offering to provide you a free retirement review just go to Edelman financial dot com slash review I you know if you're trying to figure out the key answer to the one question that is dominant in the retirement planning issue is real simple\nDo I have enough money to retire will I in fact be able to retire and comfort just go to as I said Edelman financial dot com slash review or call us a triple

broken in twenty twenty and they will be finished by twenty twenty three with the environmental impact report released ... this year\nAnd we'll send you go does need to upgrade and expand the airport has been pushed back on the traffic concerns as more people head the terminal one over the next several years the primary concern people lack of public transportation options including the trolley which is not currently go to the airport if all bullies the chair of the airport authority\nOne other thing that we have dining and our environmental impact report in punish one hundred and fifty five million dollars to pull that off from Harvard drive onto an on air port road way so that there would be a new entrance\nAnd get that traffic off of Harvard try I think that there are concerns about bringing ... to the airport I couldn't agree more we should have ways other than by car\nTo get to the airport and the airport is more than happy to participate and funding no solution once the solution for identified the problem is that if we are young and because of the ratio of who is using\nSome kind of solution that at Nineteen fifty two percent the responsibility of the airport [noise]\nSome of the agency is going to have to come up with the other forty eight percent and done\nAgency is really need to get a project on the books because we can't do that they need to get a project on the book and then we will happily go to the FAA and say you know this is how we calculated our percentage can we do that and we're hoping that that will happen soon\nAble bowling the chair of the airport authority one possible solution to be an out of the box idea supervisor Ron Roberts is proposing a series of gun violence across downtown he calls the San Diego skyway\nThis is something that's really of interest to me because we've been working on how can we do a better job of getting people to the airport and recently I helped to put together the funding so we would do a study of something that's new a sky way that would take passengers literally from Santa Fe depot coming off the trains and trolleys\nDirectly to the airport or go the other way go from the airport all the way down to the hotels along harbor drive into the convention center and just move a lot of people without impacting the road system at all\nNo folks who are hearing this for the first time what would that be likely to become a tram system what what would you think it looks like\nWhat we're proposing is something that looks like the cars that you would see on a ski left enclosed cabin\nThat would hold say eight to ten people comfortable sitting for vision all around completely you know class from the two or three feet off the floor of the top so something really unique that is being used and other places in the world seems\nTo be absolutely the solution for San Diego in certain areas and I think the airport is definitely one of those\nWhat would something like this a cost what would it look like how would we see it comes in you know I think obviously the costs me the number one factor but how we should come to fruition\nFirst of all you know we're estimating it'd be a little over two hundred million to two and the cost really is larger you depend on how many stations you have the stations where you get on and off to board these really the most expensive part of the whole system the rest of it\nIt's just a cable and some columns that basically they cable hangs from and you have these cars that there are spaced about maybe twelve to Fifteen seconds apart so you've got the capability of picking up and delivering passengers sort on demand it really for situations that were described ...\nThere is not a less costly system there's not a more efficient system and there's no system that would be as much fun as this should be\nIt'd be up in the area that nice views out over the harbor and it'd be quite a way to either arrive or depart from San Diego but I think there's other areas of San Diego where this will make sense also\nYou talked about it perhaps going down maybe along the harbor drive there in the convention center in those areas right\nExactly right yeah that's the study that we just released shows are going from the airport by way of the train depot to the convention center and all of the hotels and seaport village allowing harbor drive\nYou mentioned the the costs compared to some of the other options many people are working for the trolley to extend the airport in some capacity what do you think about the trolley going they're just on his own and then compared to this project as well cost wise\nI can tell you that the trolley going to what we call them id coastline that goes from old town up to the University of San Diego and\nThat over to the U. T. C. that's costing us over two hundred million per mile\nPer mile to do it in any way shape or form to try to connect the existing trolley line with the terminals over and Harvard arrive it's gotta be well over that in terms of cost it's going to be far more expensive\nAnd I think giving you a far less level of service person I've worked on the trolley for years for decades literally and had the\nTerminals been built along the Pacific highway we could have made that were pretty easily in fact we probably could have trolleys going right into the terminals that opportunity is gone now at the airport has made a decision there terminals are going to be alone and Harvard drive so\nIt's a question how do we get there and I don't think it's likely that we can bring a trolley to that location and certainly we couldn't bring a trolley or any time in the near future", "year": "2018", "show_name": "KOGO Weekend News Edition", "city": "San Diego", "day": "20"}
