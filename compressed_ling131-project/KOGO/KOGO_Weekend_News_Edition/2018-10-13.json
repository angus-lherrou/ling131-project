right next to that already coming in pension and Social Security\nWhen you start to add these pots together or stack these sources of income on top of one another before you know it a large part or maybe all of your fixed expenses are met\nAnd that really allows a retiree to relax Mm\nOkay make sense and so we want to teach people how to do this right\nAnd there's a lot of people out there
