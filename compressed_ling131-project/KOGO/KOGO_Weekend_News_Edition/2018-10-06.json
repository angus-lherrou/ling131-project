into retirement to the financial decisions you were making the role of your money it's all going to change once you leave your job then you start heading back down the mountain and\nI mentioned it Brad real briefly some of the risk that I wasn't really prepared for and my recent experience getting this coming back down the mountain\nSome of the risks normally think about our our money in retirement are kind of obvious stock market risky to health care long term care but there are others that can kind of sneak up on things like inflation or even taxes\nMaybe you don't see those liabilities coming at ya\nHow do you help somebody understand just wide hall there in four as they're heading into retirement\nThey've just kind of mentioned what our process as here so the first time we meet someone who it's it's not we can't answer those things it the first time we meet someone has a ... to get a complete feel for everything that that person or couples doing now and what their goals are what they're trying to accomplish so you take all the financial assets that somebody has\nSocial Security's pension for one case I raised and then you really get an idea of how much income do you need right what is your budget each month what kind of goals do you have for vacations or to help\nKids out or legacy goals afterwards and you start dissecting and then when you build this plan the second time we meet with you then we have all those answers you know they'll give you an example of um somebody that I sat down with the first time a few weeks back here and we're meeting together soon to go over this so I'm kind of excited to be able to do that\nBut this woman had been a a pretty successful working of her whole life so yes she had a very good Social Security she's in her mid sixties\nRight now she's been retired for a couple of years she also was fortunate enough to have a pension\nAmong she'd saved a good amount of assets so I'm really good portfolios both in IRAs and non iris what she did is she came to one of our Social Security events and we hosts that if you don't notice if you are a regular listener and I happen to be not only a certified financial planner but I'm a national Social Security advisor\nOr as a from as a whole Social Security something we take very seriously we host these events every month because\nBelieve it or not there are so sturdy experts that still give you advice that'll security is really complicated there's all these rules and options that you need to know about and sometimes people don't realize the spousal benefits are switching techniques and you can just be leaving basically free money your own money\nAnd they have all those years believing that on the table and missing it 'cause you don't know these strategies and that's great and that's what's all security experts know was the strategies but you could still choose ... incorrectly if you don't take your investments in your taxes and other things into consideration so we host Social Security events every month like clockwork here two different nights\nAre typically Wednesdays and Thursdays but all you needed to do is go to Epstein in white dot com so once again

Social Security benefits that she had a three three hundred and twenty some odd dollars a month all the way to eleven hundred\nWhich she was living with him was life change and so there's so many life

and interest or to stack on top of the pension that that's pretty much been meeting her needs and that's what she's been living off for the last couple of years and she's in her mid sixties

they feel comfortable because once they open the shop there will be you know are we living of the ceiling and it will be a difficult time for them but we'll also be groundbreaking for others and maybe even for themselves it can be cathartic experience so if they feel comfortable about it and they're willing to come forward\nI Would suggest that they do\nUm and also for men or are you asking about men who\nHave perpetrated wasn't that difficult one because I'm unless they are contrite about it and then what they want to talk about it they could probably don't want to talk about it and they stay

Diego punch s live Evers latest article detail the fight to the future the airport\nLimburg fields in the process of expanding terminal one and three billion dollar project but there's still no connection to the trolley or public transportation and all the other government agencies want the airport to pay for at least some of the infrastructure upgrades\nSan Diego or Port Authority earlier this year relief it's this big voluminous document called its environmental impact report for its plan to renovate terminal one that idea of making terminal one bigger and better more gates more people flying in and out make it nicer like terminal to already is\nThat idea is supported and shared by basically everybody in town there's no one who doesn't like that what they have revealed that they do not like is exactly the way that the airport is going about it so\nThe way this process works the airport puts out this big environmental report and then all these other public agencies have like a month and a half to respond formally and writing so I went through all the different ah responses these these big letters that they they put out\nAnd you know every major public agency in town that had by the standards of environmental impact report response letters pretty scathing things to say and so their basic complaint is that if you're going to make the airport bigger and better and make more people fly into and out of it\nThat it's going to have even you know even more traffic going to the airport than there today\nAnd you should have some serious projects to help deal with all that namely one of the things that I think this is the most sought after and most attractive idea to the San Diego I talked to which is finally getting the trolley to go to the airport\nAnd so I think there's a lot of these other agencies who really think that this is a good opportunity to once and for all bring the ... to the airport you you do it as part of this terminal want expansion\nRather reports from the city the county or the poor to we asked a question in July when the survival impact report was released we asked ... how you get the trolley there and they said well really it's up to San Diego or some other agencies to build that and we set aside the land but\nThey were talking in July about even having the high speed rail connect to admits decades all\nYeah so the airport solution to this is there there is a project that's been kind of contemplated for a while\nUm rules right off the tongue really easy name you can tell a marketing with came up with it it's called the inter mode all transit center that idea has has been around for a while it's part of sandbags long term plan [noise]\nIt's it's basically at the north edge of the station you'd have buses and trains potentially high speed rail going to it and that the the airport says you once you build that\nWe will build an automated people move or like most airports have\nThat goes to and from that to the the terminals and that's how it will will finally have a real transit connection to the airport now the problem with that is there's no money for it than that doesn't have any funding it's in ... plans but it's been ... plans or something that\nIsn't paid for so their promise is a promise to build something that connects the airport to a thing that may never be built so that's one problem the airport has said\nLook the sandbags job or that's MPs this job or what have you basically all of these other agencies really eight major aids and she agencies Caltrans support sandbag MPs the county ... city of San Diego and they all say it's not entirely your job\nAirport but it is partially your job you need to play a\nBig role in making sure there's enough money\nTo pay for this sort of thing and the sticking point the sticking point here is that\nAs far as the airport is concerned um their revenue is largely comes from airport travelers and since it comes from airport travelers it's regulated by the FAA so they're saying none of these ideas that you have that that we could do to to make it easier to get to and from the airport\nUm are things that we can do until the FAA tells us we can do\nIf we can do them and so they're saying until that comes with you know we just we just don't know if that's possible the other agencies have basically said well\nWhy don't you go get that essay approval and then get back to us so that you know ... there's no reason to build this project now and then potentially down the line find out that the FAA says no\nThis is a Fox News alert the
