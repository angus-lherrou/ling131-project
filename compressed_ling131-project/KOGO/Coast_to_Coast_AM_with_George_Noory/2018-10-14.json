library this week a first was about the gig economy I don't know if you heard about the gig economy that's where you get a side hustle and then\nPerhaps some quick and easy ways to make a buck and we're looking at sites like water loan bellhop indoor dash and others we speak to add a video editors actually thriving in the gig economy\nThen our next command on demand that we put out this week is about the deceptive technologies that are being used to fool your senses and why businesses and celebrities like Sharon ... pep boys are banding Facebook\nAnd what you need to know about Facebook's controversial new posting guidelines for businesses and also for fake news and then of course we had the golden age or radio or some of the most popular programs from the thirties forties and fifties

website over at pot net dot com once again that's ... net dot com and back to the phones we go with Tom and Peoria, Illinois hello there\nThomas [noise] hello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource function or something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I end up using a nap or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go\nThere and easier way to do that by having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday so I thought it would be cool to make a little look at the end of the summer that shit\nHere's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday surf act\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long and about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard you know what I thought it was like there are publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site a there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten grapes photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available or icy\nIf you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest\nAbout what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and 'cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word bank called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular apps that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it there's Henri that work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kinda fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book but that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures bang we communicated back and forth on fiber big ... in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the Web site called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animations\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task put in front of you Tom\nCalling us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note\nThrough the website and I know this sounds crazy and and a lot of people don't believe me

a ... and thank you for staying I Know you've got an early interview a nonstop interviews I guess [laughter] um this again relates to the Simpson trial it's an important question was there anything\nIn ... track record or background that should have set off warning bells to kill our city before selecting them to do the prosecution\nWell I had never heard of either one of them before but that that really doesn't mean anything 'cause we have a thousand prosecutors ... days off here in LA and there's one central office about Eighteen outline offices or I have since learned that uh Clark was perceived to be among the\nTop prosecutors docked da's office ... no one that I Know that said that Chris darn what's perceived to be a top prosecutor why he was brought on the run on the case I don't know\nHe did handle the AC calling calling the situation in front of the grand jury when the d._a. was contemplating the indictment against collie but we got a little background there 'cause that was an ancillary\nUp part of this case whether colleagues would be indicted for being an accessory after the fact murder sure and then there was also the argument that whether he was a token black\nBut uh I can tell you a little bit about his background 'cause I've checked into it at least the seven years prior to the trial\nUh he told the jury I'm Talking about Darden I've been profit getting bad cop\nSeven years well I happen to know that the da ... bad cops here in LA it's extremely rare and the Rodney King situation was no exception I can just about guarantee you are that\nIf there hadn't been a tape there by that George holiday the eighty one second tape Mm private citizen no one would have ever heard the name uh Rodney King a fact Rodney king's brother when I went up to the foot he'll division of the LAPD the day after the the beating and this was before the LAPD knew about the tape and he um\nHe wanted to file a complaint against these officers from the desk SARS and said look your brothers and a lot of trouble there wasn't gonna be any filing again for officers in any event when guards and said I've been prosecuting bad costs for seven years I started thinking whoa wait a wise is this in the middle of the night with the goblins out I mean how can I haven't heard about this so I called down the office and\nSpoke to two fellow deputy da's down there who worked alongside garden and the special investigations division of the da's office which is responsible for prosecuting these misconduct cases here's what they told me\nThat in the seven years leading up to this trial Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety four Darden tried one case in one case only it was a misdemeanor case wasn't even a felony case and he lost it it's a thirty ninth and don't and street case thirty ninth adult and there was a duplex there\nThat was believed to be a crack house and the police went in there and trashed it looking for crack and they were prosecuted for vandalism and dark and handle it and lost that case and if you look at his book you mentioned a lot of cases in S. I. D.\nUh but the only case that he mentions taken the trial if you've read very close to me is the thirty nine and don't treat gay so he didn't really have a sufficient background\nBut it's so then what are you saying because of color\nWhile I don't know I don't really don't know why I was brought it not not before those seven years I don't know what his background is he says that he had prosecuted quite a few homicide cases and uh uh he may be telling the truth I don't know about that and he may have been successful but I can tell you that\nWhen he told the jury I been prosecuting bad cops for seven years he was not telling the truth was investigating bad cops for seven years but not prosecuting them\nBut as long as public image was lousy or as I watched the trial I fully expect to garden at any moment to go jumping across the room and slug somebody\n[laughter] and and that is what it looked like he he did have a chip punish false hope so [laughter]\nThat that that's pretty colorful away articulated there aren't\nLet me give you one one just unbelievable example of of of incompetence of between the two prosecutors surveys and it just it just illustrates a ... and again the book is three hundred and fifty six pages of this of this type of thing you're aware of the ... of the van editor ah bringing the vial of blood back to Iraq and if you're aware of that whole that whole issue oh yeah\nOkay um let me just briefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect blood from a suspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a monthly or sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime and murder\nAnd I'm a so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here now the the the the defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately ... and he could have done that however\nNormally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminalist pursuant to the search warrant\nHere that hadn't been done yet on a phone was still at Rockingham first he has been a Bundy collecting evidence and evidence is booked sequence Chile or\nBy number so at the book that while\nIt would have been item number one but what the reason he didn't do that if he had no way of knowing what number of phone was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting Bundy and walking him it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nWhat it would have made the argument that you'd carried it around and head opportunity a impossible yeah right\nUh but yes but it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dream that people like Shaq and Cochran or out they're accusing him of framing someone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the forests not one citizen complaint against them in twenty eight years he's about to retire in a few months with his wife read it to his farm in Indiana\nAnd he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling\nYou free you plant evidence and a capital case in California and testify falls but you can get the death penalty yourself on her one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument and in in any event\nFong had already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a batter brings the bio blood back the fog and any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the to the criminalist in their mind\nThat's the equivalent of booking not I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here why bought it back to Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but it but here's the point that I Want to get into\nThe defense argument of police frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vile blood back in what they claim does that then I met her in his evil co conspirators took blood out of that violin planted that ... had Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial\nPost trial post trial\nSeveral the juror said that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the tire case okay now there were several arguments that the prosecution could've made to knock down this core defense argument about Ben and bringing them all but back to Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring a vial of blood back the Rockingham obviously he put it in his suit pocket he wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to every one that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense to point number two number two\nThat are already knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at Rockingham and Bundy\nTheir cameras blanketing the premises picking up for the evening news all the movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously planting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other argument now what if I told you what if I told you listen to this because it's unbelievable there's no other additive than\nIn the eight hours of summation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark nor Darden said one single word to try to knock down this court defense argument about ban that are bringing the vial of blood back to Rockingham they never once even touched on that issue\nI check the transcript three times I had my wife check is unbelievable I said there's got to be some attempt to knock this now 'cause it goes to the heart of the defense case\nAren't when you get to the point when you don't have an open up your mouth and author one single solitary word on an absolutely critical issue the question is how does it get any worse we're not talking incompetence here we're talking beyond incompetent if you didn't show up for work hard I wouldn't say that you were incompetent\nIncompetence of showing up for work and doing a bad job\nRight well we didn't even argue on it but they want to be showing up for what about\nThe angle that a a ride Bennett are carried it out in the ... but a lot of people's on well ferman socked away a little bit of it remember the sock business and the took it over and planted it that's what a what\nI saw the glove they the glove they All right you know there were four teen uniformed officers that arrived at the Bundy murder scene before five minutes before ferment ferment arrived rapid two o'clock that's right and these these murders happened around a oath\nWhether there's a disparate there there is a division I Believe you know but but\nSomewhere somewhere between ten Fifteen and ten thirty five PM in the evening of June the twelve correct the first officer arrives right after midnight okay they're Eighteen uniformed officers that arrived there before for him and all of them saw only one glove so there was no second glove there\nFor for him and to pick up and deposit at Rockingham even if you wanted to even if you want it to frame Simpson by planning to go up there was no second glove there unless Eighteen officers would have been willing to take the stand and commit perjury for ferman now mind you Eighteen officers say they all\nThey all made the statement at ... in in front of a a a internal affairs but what about Clark only called two out of the team to the witness stand instead of calling you have a sixteen she had the other sixty and there she knew their names\nShe didn't bother calling all Eighteen the more you call it that stand the greater the likelihood that all Eighteen are going to commit perjury in a capital case justice\nOf someone most of whom they didn't even know from why didn't you do the incompetence gross author complete I just I can give you an example here on the ... wildlife issues or nothing could have been more important than that she didn't even open up our mouth once\nYeah there's one of the reasons one wonders punishment a and when we talk about punishment we're talking about justice I mean people say justice is fine but retribution as bad you know that's prehistoric whatever it is but how can you have justice without retribution\nJustice is just that you have met a euphemistic way obtain retribution and punishment there's another reason why I put the heightened bar and part of the main reason is deterrent to set an example that's right we we put people behind bars we punish them to tell the prospect of criminals that if you violate the law you're going to be plenty\nOf Dodger events

Institute in Virginia and William cells as a suicide Hitler therapist and he guide you\nThrough these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience they'd love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good good\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such a system set out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer and then this would be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was methods to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and\nIt's it's quite a life change your family who had actually the your tire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality has shifted\nOh yeah it is now you had your out of body experience which sounds Indian state wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise or that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was this atmosphere\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but\nThe first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall and when I\nDid you think we reached the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I'd I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking\nI was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here and ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from another words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the innocence up at ... at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYeah yes and but you can experience at first and and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't have stopped here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any sense\n[laughter] absolutely not and once you have to mention\nThat once you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah all human there has to be it wouldn't just be one that did not want him anything\nNo of course not ... it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can that I can express\nIt is and apps and he is so\nWhen you you have these experiences and you know they're real because especially they feel real you know he was playing the because usually not a language to really clearly defined what another dimension is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that\nAre symbols and it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really tell us what to do is look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism is it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia I'm\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally when I each person is in checked unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um\nWhat is that controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation booth\nTo let shift a shift them to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA a\nTragic incident national tragic incident where Massachusetts toll free number one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAt myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time um that was a that was one of their events where there was a lot of people that were just\nTotally disoriented let's put it that way a badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is called ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's which functions and different names and different cultures\nAnd up to the Institute we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can\nDo that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience it in all of that I Want to find out a little bit more about\nWhat other cultures a justice and what it calls and other cultures are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what are the culture just

is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm and react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science has on top of that so many people have common\nPhenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and there are no I'm all over or their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift\nThat's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience\nIt's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people aren't going to be travels the game to ... the brain or do you make any type of um recording um their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research a matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ...\nStates have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate\nObese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how the remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's wouldn't mind near twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to you\nEach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it\nMy main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you

Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute sedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the ... e training and then the ... Beijing yeah\nAnd he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with the the ease Cleveland was wondering if you could explain this to our audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um but I've been\nStudying this and practicing for forty a ... just to go on my website ... dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring fountains as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet\nBut there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset of Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through ... if you're seeing through your clothes diluted at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you're having it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things that\nUh for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that I see them on it because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think it's his muscles in or you're saying that now the ... say\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have\nFound and what many other um experience or have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nAnd what does it look like the image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream the can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are as natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc\nTemporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nDidn't ... biological ... machine ... and then we're ... we're moving beyond the body\nSo it didn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay ...\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awaken into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and are we still learning what was going on and I'm Still learning by the way you know one\nOf master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German\nAll right I mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification\nAnd I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a Austin will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on ...\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this as one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up specialty uh religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common name he put it and I'm going out to\nThe average age of first out of body experience have you seen ... years old and people recruit recount cancer and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I figured as an interest just affects us something to do with it\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we\nNow it's ridiculous and\nYou realize it's you know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue\nInvolved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being ... no ... none of that would occur mhm because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the\nOnes that want to be connected to [laughter] well we go beyond the ego yeah we we don't I mean we're going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls so

I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was at I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing\nAnd so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted and so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love the story this was way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family moved to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansion sight unseen I Swear\nThat because we wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts by I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really run down\n... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you\nWell after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going right oh yeah\nI actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude sorry about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest as fate so I don't think anybody's ever seen\nAnything like wow I hired twenty people\nUm to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you drinking so loud blew everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait\nTill the ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n... ... beer punishment for ally Saudi Arabia is a ...\nFound responsible for the death of Saudi journalist ...\nThere's a lot at stake and [noise]\nMade me especially so because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment\nFor president to appear on CBS is sixty minutes Sunday known for impersonating President Trump actor Alec Baldwin headlining a political fundraiser in New Hampshire\nBaldwin in an interview to summer drew attention when he said if the rain and twenty twenty you ... we went with the funniest most exciting most crazy campaign\nBoxers jarring help this dysfunctional\nSeven nine six four or five holy gentle giants dog food\nBatman I Burt Ward Robin from Batman would you like your dogs live as long as twenty seven healthy active years my wife and I created gentle giants dog food\nAt our special feeding and care program to help all dogs and puppies live longer healthier lives dogs eating gentle giants are living as long as twenty seven healthy active years twice their normal lifespan now with Wal Mart or ask your local retailer learn more German Cox\nCheese very\nLong\nCoast to coast they you know your your gift to our\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I just want to give you a quick reminder that\nI also have a great show on the guy on network along with George Norris who's got beyond belief myself called inspirations on guy and you can check it out at information's ...

Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about the ... we were just talking about men are few springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just call to you\nI'm\nI think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage his springs sports spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe out their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nSo this story about this hunted opera house no longer being hunted because the goal was set free by it the truth and guess what I went up there on our birthday me in the first day which is October seventh\nI went up there to the theater and that those is gone it worked\nSo be manager confirmed that\nThey know that all of this worked out beautifully [laughter]\nThan eating now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was\nAmazing during the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said\nHer job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team because the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nAnd this was reaching out that's currently trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes but you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast today\n[laughter] you have made it is it's\nMeant to be one you have no way really connecting history with these you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goes but like other little girl that bounces all isn't she do I'm like no leave in ... but listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere is no devious funds spirited\nNo no absolutely not if they are they're just kicking you that you've ... starts here\nThey are in prison here by their own their own their own minds they're they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as than us and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely get picked believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time\nTo actually look for those if you want to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you were living in now haunted him did you must have been non ... and the gas goes follow you right yes\nThey do on line two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk on her name's bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and I went there once a month and doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah because I happen to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the ... of the life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so\nYeah they're like oh Archie especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm like no really I'm Serious I was just wondering

infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see light up\nLight up with the red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains this very sacred land it's very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine and you're right there in the center\nOf the country yeah the center of the world the\nPikes peak they believe was the naval of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this

coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and we're talking about Colorado legends in lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends lower but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the more usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area\nIn that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know about the beach\n[noise] well um pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. a ... or have a I think that's what the native youth used to call it\nBut they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhine whine and we've been called up that's connected to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get um father sky Mother Earth\n... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it\nStands out like a sore thumb there and the natives knew that it that of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more equal than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers took flight over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw UFO when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards about the time it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because even today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brush it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm\nTheoretically punter exactly up and down sideways ring you know like a helicopter mhm a fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine\nYou would not there is a lot of people yeah\nBut a lot of people thought this I mean just outrageously crazy and you found his story in Kansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent very much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's there was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web\nCould possibly know when farmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we've had the telegraph of them\nDo you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there to conduit or a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as a director this paranormal convention and the one of my friends is named Dan ... and he lives in the mountain falls Colorado\nAnd um which is right underneath pikes peak and um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the high any on his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter] and um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal\nAnd he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick clips and the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know oh I mean why not\nBut have you seen in the writings\nHe believes that my friend he only if it's um you know it's like stick figure I find that fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believe that his property is a portal\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider\nThe possibility that may be big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe have coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seeing something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell tell me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel\n[noise] [noise]\nBeyond radio six

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reach the arm out\nOh no I was not on the go I I didn't realize it was that you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is it now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being\nGuide anyone there are actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense of ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't his top tier I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms\nYeah not all human and has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was clean because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertainment is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say\nTo go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really tell us what to do is look like when you have people

consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're mad their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate\nObese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly\nOut of remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for

E.\nMails radio six hundred go go [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nBack that goes because I Am my guest is William ... and he's talking\nAbout out of body travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at them in roe Institute surveyed over sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at the Monroe Institute in Virginia and he's come up with a common reports\nAnd now I'm an associated with the Cleveland Plain dealer audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um\nBut I've been studying this in practice in it for forty or just to go on my Web site that's true info dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted or touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your closed ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't mean you ... your body but it'd be injured in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nAnd then that's the dance on because then half I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experiences I've seen and explored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is\nMhm we take for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep\nAnd you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\n... image\nOr looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you want an animal sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream began or they\nMay be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that if you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into and he'll be and that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how did you hear me now to me\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master\nWe're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification\nAnd I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier and World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get to download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in ... were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOr what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated parents might not have anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh ... it had\nBeen programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this ... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you after you experience that menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\nOh back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age first out of body experience have you seen ... years old people recruit recount painting and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nGet out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we\nEat out it's ridiculous and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the\nCore issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly your work one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict or be no wars or be no no none of that would occur\n... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nWe go beyond the ego\nYeah we we are we going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take

cause sure and has to go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jeannie when does your question huh\nHow's it going great [noise] what is your question my friend\nCurious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and uh\n... is a question question you\nMay not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... ... a little bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself but not\nStart cutting your pants off of you and the whole nine yards and uh but I was going to say though is uh oh I was scared to death are are are truly was in\n... right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and I I was worried about anything anymore\nMm that sounds he so tense peaceful and is is\nWhat it was exactly hateful\nHave you been able to recreate than experience or not and heart attack that feeling that experience a peace\n[noise]\nNo I Wish I could ... it would actually be great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could he\nYeah absolutely and one of the things that people do report\nWhen they have and out of body experience um\nIs that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace and ... that just flows through them mhm uh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people reported\nLike their entry into a sea of of love and um and acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even the there is no words to even describe some of these things\n'cause they're beyond or I'm a verb itch but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do have\nA explore these experiences so they can uh let's just say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n...\nNow and thank you very much ... in the shade it I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience some ... you can't it's not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ... if you're a\nFear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a whole\nOf or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have you made likely have a negative experience your own fear will create it when we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers\nOf non physical reality we're participants\nEach song is a creative projection and we are influencing the energies around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative energy if if there is not like there's negative entered its you are going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that as well\nWell you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but that's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was just a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I was\nShocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that I'm\nBryan owns a motorcycle and he was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was the name was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension which\nLooks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we can't each other [laughter] yeah\nI Do know is that an added well out of body travel most likely mhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there was a object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there was non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective\nGroup of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right to gravity we're used to error you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing the air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of the are\nExistence yes so that will be\nDial tone to fifty on your mobile phone to the key word free bottle or didn't dial pound to five zero it'd be the key word free bottle unwritten\nGo go go go dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am so Mike yesterday her website is called managed to legend dot com and I love the beginning of it it does [laughter] welcome to the blue moon hunted history tours Ruben probably scaring the public since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie Lisa\nI'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan I'm going to scare the ... out of it while it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really say piano or is it is that there's a sharing anyway come to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's really unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we are normal\nWell this this oh I've been seeing go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not\nMy goal was to try and the unite the paranormal ... community and to also\nDo some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado mhm\nAnd so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and leave we call it ... feast because every year\nWe tried to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history\nSo even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on in the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened and I particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually published my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through you're going to thyroid cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child what do you mean seeing it you've you've I see it and I actually feel it I'm just plain like humans to my examples that well I can\n[laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny that I can actually sense things [noise] um I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was that and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing\nAnd so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in ... Springs Colorado and he was taunted and so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nHe'd you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is the way through I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansion\nSight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so he was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that\nHow he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and if you ... you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts style I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\n... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we passed the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house\n... what have you well after you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] yeah so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest as fate so I don't think anybody's ever seen\nAnything like wow I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you fool out literally everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named\nI knew I wanted to know what he does his friend Sonia my step mom's go center [laughter] and uh yeah\nIt it it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally\n[laughter] oh ...\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling and now you still live in ... springs right tell us a little of the history of that area\nWell that's I Believe this is one and this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah\nOh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in Little Rock he's ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of me he said he was fascinated with manages springs especially because we had some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of the manatee springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we had in my house is shaking my head and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious let the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up\nAnd um you can feel it um and the other thing that curious about it is that because these magnetic anomalies\nUm Nicholas ... actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as the bird um we're just\nGoing over managing spring was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense that they're ready to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it will be he was saying he was leading that maybe\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused because they were actually\nBehaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and in like ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs
