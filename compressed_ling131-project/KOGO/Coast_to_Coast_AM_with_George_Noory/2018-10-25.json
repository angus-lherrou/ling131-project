war\nThrough the ... when they go back and look at things that have happened in the recent past they they immediately think that you know we are in the civil war\nEspecially when they're young something like ... symmetrical warfare an ideological warfare\nPeople tend to think it has to be always an armed conflict that's why the guys who was the definition of war and I says well it's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand\nAre are armed at times and the time they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars sometimes there are warring factions with in certain groups whether it be right or left\nHow many ... groups have we heard the KKK the Nazis the communist\nOr I could go down the list of black lives matter me too I mean just go down the list of all the factions are at war with each other right now none of them pulling guns on people but yet we have somebody who ideologically disagrees with Hillary Clinton the Obamas\nAnd the

out of the left but no one has even brought up the shootings of the congressman\nThere not bringing up the other of a rice was bailed out in the rice was about to President Trump this is certainly one sided and it's there just to basically harden the resolve of the persecution complex to the left it's obviously it obviously this is what is happening\nOr a yes or am I still on yeah go ahead okay I'd also like say that um I Believe it was Mark Twain said a patriot as one who is scorned at first\nBut when others join him it cost them nothing and I believe firmly that that might be Donald Trump\nIt

pregnant with a guy who can vote on all\nYeah exactly right we've got a conspiracy then at that point whether or not it is a you know a a a something that is coordinated or something that is organic but I can tell you I Want to get to the bottom of it I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing ... he created environments somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our thirties and intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been\nYou know at one another stroke but we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is Beth\nWe can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would give my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears\nAs you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their some keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster\nThan if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false\nFlag it'd be somebody on the left\nThat did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their job then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue and let's stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ...\nWe will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as described the killing of ... to show me as a heinous crime in his first comments and some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death\nSpeaking edited investors conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been sold them and said that those responsible for

can be used to easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost efficiency let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I like to make a technical comment on the fence today um I I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this being tracked down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as being very very high\nUm for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices that means all kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the UN at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities they\nProbably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera\nThat the post office is ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to uh be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it are the eye of the is going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole application for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the ah high rent urban areas they

bounce spirit so it can be someone sounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not like a demon it's probably just that maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nOn to use a possible ... that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit but uh just lingers for ever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of him because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked um there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nDown when do you mean by ... would you shouldn't smoke\n'em [laughter] so it was already on edition girls\nThat I Know I'm Sorry and clarify a magician and it can actually send you an earth mounds spirit and what they do is they will go and I'm looking for spirits at the cemetery\nWho have not crossed over and they will make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send a spirit to you and if that happens actually quite frequently\nThe under the control of Lucia per se\n[noise] the dark lord\nAh absolutely I definitely believe in the dark lower it exists\nAs when you should somebody sends them ...\n[laughter]\nDoing a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have

might be tonight\nTom uh I picked people that\nThe audience will know in that you will know\nBecause the whole idea of the show is to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they tried to tricky aren't really creative fire remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not gas him at all he had you and I think in

there\nAnd how you doing oh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\nKnow not in my fifth fall but eight days of 'em up\nOh I don't know I got older things get tough for\nIts Stanton reading a mortgage Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed the\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to limit the male hunger\nAnd yes you are an ID we need to we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and these uh January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months without going anywhere ah against my nature\n[laughter] well I tell you we love just stand that I'm going to tell everybody\nWho might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw a little clip being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder out I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming we're all getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney hill case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or they could be sending a signal\nWell the latest word against it looks like they're about one point six climates per star opera galaxy star and\nOur galaxy the Milky Way ahead of them have a hundred billion stars all that means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all on that\nDarn plays and you know that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and\nWe're at the top of the heap well roll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth ... nuclear fusion for example ... you\nCan get ... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a special bus or in the world was created and four thousand ... see that's right it can be killing beings around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be\nJust a little the little\nUh our natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things [laughter] the ultimate piano hurtful thing [noise] um we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and\nThere should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place that whether this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying but the mirror throws a climate that they put in incarcerated people you know\nBut yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people and it's it's it's rather than you are one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New

still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of how we bring span of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one points are trying

life out there and we see it mhm you know they would make contact and\nThe White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people on the east coast has jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd wait but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are\nAnd there's still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us learned that\nIf it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number oh oh no [laughter]\nNo ... and so\nWhat we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind and it's about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that at all the\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on and on ways to kill people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a

the only a retired police officer in white all New York back in Nineteen Seventy six\nHad a near face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic by federal creature\nThat he was thirty feet away from it and I'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his wife and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual in white all New York very soon as names off the buying one\nAnd so it's going to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy\nYou know you for already endorsing the book yes uh\nIt it's something that is a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nAbsolutely build this ... this officer of course has no reason why it has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have heart\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this man it was my good friend Mike super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer ... one\nAnd went actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and then I've had dialogue with officer guzzling since and\nHe's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers are over a two nights band that actually solve this creature so was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police and so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present\nAnd then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe the big bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the U.S does ah I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet what's your take\n[noise] well I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and we're dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think\nBiblical eight now or if you're reading things like uh of course you know if you're reading a knock which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book V. knock it talks about\nThe ... the thoughts of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called the now from those Neff limb had unnatural sex acts with the beast of the field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot soft watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these ... ah\nYou know made it with ... and I find anything can be\nTo now think about this and a lot of these cases there seems to only be\nOne foot print there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy ... of of these types of friends and I've thought about that and I thought okay\nIf if it's not a hoax then perhaps\nThis creature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eye witnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think of the old Patterson give them all and so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] I don't know it\n... I'll say this though if that was a fake it was a darn good one\nA darn good one and it would have to be someone you would think that would be gargantuan to fit in to that type of a outfit to be able to make that come off as real and another thing George if you think about this\nAs you watch the creature walk away you see the arms swinging and the arms look very long they certainly look longer

I think he was in the front\nAt so the so a governor calmly and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it would have been a row of sitting there and and the\nDriver I or the other Secret Service agent who was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nIn that car would have been six strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you ... to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up disapproved of film and I'm watching them come over and what you describe it impacts his wife right and I'm hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film right now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a ...

as you know I'm opposed to it I don't want to use it or curing feels very secure with it I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nYour dad has to do with\nThe use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also\nWhat a lot of people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about and how you view yourself with in the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drive to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nFor the place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover than the whole the whole atmosphere around the school changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow these evil spirits and introduced to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and Sullivan will believe and that they're earning power that they are just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strengths within and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine being and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that kind of ... and beyond\nThat kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the war that I Do with this tool is no different than somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your intention set\nYou use it only as a tool you have there is no hidden spirits in view or power inside of these chunk of wood or cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of its within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\nHave you ever had a bad ...\nNo I haven't had bad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing that and he wants to the board and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty screw through the board they were crossing\nOr the board but let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse for the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored you might aboard\nAn eye on and go good and going and that's\nIt and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs about where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful of everything that's going to draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment within me that I could really\nA strengthen myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it's been just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving in the plant chip Geron is at the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving\nWill answer that from a few different directions one as many people believe that the idiom motor effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles are the powers a gesture is making the plant shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism our memories them that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds\nThat's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut the moving spell out messages\nTo Beijing worked with an inch absolutely\nAmazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked him before I talked about um before on your show and work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say\nWhen you come to the plant chat and you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combined together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower the heirs to reach our frequencies that we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows messages to flow the plants have to move and for for all the communications

Karen\nTo put somebody down if they don't like the ... board that I appreciate\nWell I I you know that that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean he's one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness\nAnd this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness ocean I'm not for that I'm for having a discussion about it I'm for people having different opinions\nThis tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use the tool this kind of floor are different one so I think it's great that we come together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group the talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a among stuff with all of us believe it doesn't work some of some of the leaves at work because of the motor and a few of my believe it works because we're actually connect with an energy outside of herself\nBut we can all exist together have a love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so we weren't at war group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning each other\nOn the board start and and how how long ago\nWell

or the group that ... packaging exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go and his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or you know if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy\nYou will old wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep those\nPeaks their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced and law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd individuals in institutions in in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight\nShut out wait let the intelligence officials do their job then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the weight empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and doing things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody up front\nUm they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right

perpetrators of a very short period of time as being very very high I'm ... I mean these are all unexploded devices that means\nAll kind of trace evidence is available for them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI\nThe U.S at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities they\nProbably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera\nAt the post office or ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you want it to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individuals I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it or the eye of the day is going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new vent system in the ah high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr am I from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in South Carolina has scoop the largest jackpot in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how that he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with a which that's right next on coast to coast day um [noise]\nI Am Kevin ... would be again and we all knew Kevin from ... capital we're here to talk about bitcoin Kevin I was surprised when you called me and said you were also getting into crypto currency is what's going on\nWith George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about bit pointed traded for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\n\n\nLong snooze I'm Carmen Roberts searching for a possible aids explosive package postal workers say that one was sent to the former vice president\nJoe Biden because it bears some similarities to those are dressed the other democratic officials the baggage was originally going to bite into old address in Delaware but was return to sender so far there's been no indication of anything actually being found hat and bite into\nBoxes Todd pyro President Trump denouncing the package threats that are rally last night and Wisconsin will\nYa I call this is Tom\nThey already Japanese journalist freed from captivity in Syria says he lived in hell for more than three years and finally he's headed home very happy about that al ... kidnapped June pay yesterday in\nTwenty Fifteen sons sneeze [noise]\nI'm voting in the mid term elections because my because my ancestors died snake for my children one in ... for me I unlike the weak and remain free helping community I'm putting\nIn the mid term elections because every vote makes it didn't matter vote I vote the eye and then they turn\nTo register to vote go to I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to vote Tuesday November ...\nMedia and the city cultured coalition\nSean Hannity here and I know for honesty and integrity and they have for thirty two years so how about this they'd been recognized by Angie's lists super service award multiple times and they were rated a plus with the San Diego better Business Bureau\nI never am afraid to speak my mind which is why I Would only hire RL roofing in solar take it from me Sean Hannity trust R.

Dan Hi sir we kicked around the idea of\nDoing the show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with him we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom Dan highs or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight Tom\nUh I picked people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the shows to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to tricky aren't really creative I remember\nWhen the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not guess him at all\nHe had you and I think in honey and\nIt was good to in he when he was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one a in this nine will go by really quick and one more quick question for you\nGoes to goes next Wednesday Halloween Night or you're putting together a number of uh email ghost stories from people and will have the actual people on the year with me that night\nUh in of course we'll take calls from our listeners to what their ghost stories so we're ready to go there\nReady to go to ship enough to be a fun show we're going to honor\nOkay Thanks Tom okay so let's open up the first secret door\nActually I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd how you doing oh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\nWell not in my fifth fall but eight days of 'em up\nOh I don't know I got older\nThings get tough for\nIts Stanton reading a mortgage Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed the\nHeightened guy you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell or it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm\nA before I'm going to Olympic demand hunger\nAnd yes you are and we need we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and the ... of January November and December\nI Can't believe it two months without going anywhere ah against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you how are we\nLove just stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named stamped and Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nOr an uncle in university and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder\nOut I went ... interviewed Stanton Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stamp was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest\nEnd of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming where there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the fields have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word began it looks like they're about one point six climates for star not bring galaxy star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion stars\nAll that main one hundred and sixty billion so they're all over the\nPlace and you know that changed as our picture we used to think we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know get in here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth\n... nuclear fusion for example\nOr you can get ... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop mushroom club of the world was created and four thousand ... see that's right it can be killing beings around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be\nJust a little little\nUh our natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things [laughter]\nThe ultimate piano hurtful thing [noise] um we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place\nOh well this is a result of spontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out of the same but the mirror throws a limit that they put\nIn incarcerated people you know like yeah like a personal glad boy guy's been brought on earth [laughter]\nSo you never know the way they've been treating people and it's it's it's you're standing you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you\nChanged your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of hungry for expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that what we think there's one point six planets for stars so I guess like a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably coming here uh I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if there were a life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact pending land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast as Tim full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOil or or still slapped [laughter] and\nAnd so a ... most of us all learned that\nIf it's a more complex place than we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that and uh hey\nWe're not number oh oh no [laughter] no ... and so\nWhat we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on a blind and it's about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that at all the\nPeople don't get the goodies of our from their work [noise] uh we take for leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature or what it appears to be close to what it is [laughter] I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to men in the universe and you know I've gone to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... personal almost kind of stuff in\nWhy don't we hear too much about a abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted but there it was warm maybe we ... I haven't talked to any live leaders\nOr maybe they ... yeah maybe they got all and me a raccoon enough\nIs enough and met might not be surprising ... people\nI I have a great deal of faith in humanity of humanity wag gets pushed a little bit and we used to restrain as I said it two thousand nuclear weapons around and nobody's using them\nAnd I'm pleased about it because it enables us to use her energy to move more constructive directions 'cause I think\nMy grandson will grow up but at age where there is interaction\nGuy I sure hope you're you're right about that than we are going to take a quick break we'll be back with you in just a moment we'll take phone calls stance on ... been with us his website is going to be linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot\nCom we put the information up after I guess who they are or if I don't guess likes we'll put it up right after that but we'll be back\nWith your phone calls with a chance to talk to the father of modern day you fall as she was dancing for\nOne of the perks of being a co students ... or is that you can participate in our twenties monthly lived chance sessions or read the transcripts leader\nYour jewelry chance with insiders and the second Tuesday of the month this visual gift featured leaders among\nThe coast insider Lincoln coast to coast am dot com to get started\nWalks News I'm Krista ...
