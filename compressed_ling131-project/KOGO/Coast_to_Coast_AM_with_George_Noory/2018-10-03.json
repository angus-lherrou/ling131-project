warming climate change we don't want for you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\nThis is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you\nA written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a Frazier's over and over is think outside the box so the title was thick outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really tripped and the green boxer sustainable development there\nThey're forced to do many things that don't really do anything for the environment\nAre the ice caps melting or not\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years\nAnd so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole in Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations and I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice and fallen off the shelves melting away and everything else yeah\nI mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet boat but usually what they don't mention is that there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about ... want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional a nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind a you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar and people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution I'll\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nOr no they are all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats and other room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty are six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide\nOur water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is making a comeback as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy to use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so ... or as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours is screaming match is yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times to one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nHim a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion I'm so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\n... there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are of the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they caused the ice ages\nThen we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nIn our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nSteven

set up to the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nUh developing nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount and are you\nIs that is completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the with the United states cutting its commitment or they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWhich after a scandal amongst some of the scientists who wore a ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate it was called the University of East Anglia back in two thousand nine oh they don't know if somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker\nAnd these emails showed some very bad a behavior uh there were a a guy that ah [noise]\nAh we're saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk hating or data or there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process\nI'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that the scientists of East Anglia and by the way this was a this was the primary mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nUh they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or or procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nUrge either I hurt my child guy with everybody\nDoing the you're just scared the heck out of my guests\nIraq as to hey buddy\nA many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy ... Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork the blow in Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen [noise]\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve is Yellowstone and that full Cain although I understand there's a big went under their their call during\nThe day after tomorrow was based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slowed down the Gulf Stream which is part of a the a\nA global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists know realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make your head\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout landfills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was about a twenty four ... boots\nLame you know they were were burning off the methane\nGas well we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd what do you know Christianity they'll\nCome back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only way they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why hasn't been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve von Loor\nBump into spoken to him several times are hurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that\nAccuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends Steve\nNot to make the same mistake that he's a climate change hopes there's a are using a ... I Believe me I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars ... I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we wouldn't have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject man and a a ... a\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the process is told us is this your second shift in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or were somehow going to a massive really improved airlines they're doing All right it was out as his boss will rich a lot of them are\n[laughter] oh what a great\nMix dim the lights for this next one was\nA professional entire needed to start their new light you can help by donating daily using national clothing and accessories for women of all sizes now through October Fifteen locations throughout San Diego is an operation dress code dot com to find a location near you operation dress code\nI call them\nTalks these radio I'm Carmen Robert Senator Mitch McConnell has not set a date yet for a confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh\nWhat I can tell you wish it was certainly is living up your report this week and ... the\nFBI is expected to finish a background check into sexual misconduct accusations against having all this week democratic leader Chuck Schumer says\nThere ought to be adequate time for people to review the report before they're called on to vote\nFox is Jared helper and reporting on volcano erupts this morning in Indonesia and the same island suffering from an earthquake and tsunami disaster that left more than Thirteen hundred people dead and the survivors struggling\nMany of these people have lost loved ones but tens of thousands are also now have left and they say nay chunks of aid coming anytime they scan\nIs reporter shit on Robin Fox news we report you decide\nAll about your ... your passion your hours your reputation all huge their partnership even bigger [noise]\nWith the technology advisor you'll get the tax advice and one on one partnership to help your business ground because with a reliable PCs and our core processor you can focus on what matters most to getting business down\nA seventh heaven by down to speak with an advisor today at age seven seven I doubt\nYou don't remember days you remember moments but when the old tapes in photos that hold your cherish memories degrade or worse you lose them they're gone forever Hi I'm Nick Marco and I'm Adam based water we started legacy bars to help you preserve those irreplaceable moments\nLoad your legacy box with your old tapes film pictures in audio and send them in you'll get them back on DVD or convenient them Dr visit legacy box dot com slash USA and for a limited time you'll get forty percent off your order legacy box dot com slash usa\n[noise] five times the most iconic brand in the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now by time investor dot com dome is your chance to be part of his Purina making busy at high time investor dot com lifetimes investor dot com\nI sold the corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investigating shares kind of stuff and I told the court develop significant risks the investment as suitable only person who can afford to lose their entire invest further more investors must understand as such investment\nCould be liquid for an indefinite period of time public market currently exists for the security and if a public park a developed following the offering it may not continue to get a copy of the offering circular which contains information about high ten told the court the offering and other related topics including the risks of investment pleases high times investor dot com that's high times investor dot com I immediately\nCivilians are investors and holding court but are not associated with his offer ... media and its affiliates in that responsible\nFor the information contained his message the information including I tend to better dot com or the information filed with the securities and Exchange Commission\nHere's a new word come misery ... misery is the misery you feel when you sell your home but pay too much income mission\nHere's another new word purple bricks purple bricks rescues you from ...

able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that

California\nRoost in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time to weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and they no doubt this a lot of\nSand but harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why\nYou're not seeing the real ... weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but there's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThis guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite maps but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm friends hurricanes tropical storms low pressure is on coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd is being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nThey're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they install hurricanes they can blast thunder heads they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather\n... when the only hear about it in the new let's Steve's reaction to the roost like you\nBruce says something might have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some cloud seeding attempt spoke to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more call or maybe two if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he go ahead\n[laughter] well as you go higher than man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the weather pattern is being Gail engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George just recently at gentleman on a show talking about the ... put out a video called Franken's guide\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people have race so much heck let's use the word headache about the fact that they're doing this\nSo they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the campaign trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have the they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricanes to the age of heart and now\nOf that then you got to geo engineering of the show on the crops which is destroying honeybees are almost becoming a and I think that's pretty much gonna destroy everything yeah I agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was the only man ever come up with man is not smart enough\nTo honest I got a power okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing that I'm proud of it it got us out of the climate accord sham men they want they were doing is gripping the industrial nations away\nAnd get into the pockets of the little league\nAnd mean try to do with their sky completely not a dime and do it either Russia but the United states of America was going to white guy now I don't blame a Trump one bit I agree with that I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve and ed thank you for your comment Steve thank you good luck

didn't do anything to him but it caught him on a wears\nOff and on this particular day he was standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing ... uh pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees surrounding it a little in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd went to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention\nWhen he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and one position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it low was done and again we'll moments later he sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was known maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about Maine oh this is a very interesting a story a\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the rest of New England combined\nAnd you're\nNinety percent of it is uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state [noise]\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine or the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven\nWell as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tools\nThe wife is saying the husband was a shovel wisdom rate was this so finally the husband get the idea that they're going to gather together all the tools they have doing inventory\nAnd then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the ... the wife pulled the bistro table on the patio and they were using them for putting plans and no sooner had they left them out there a

comebacks William she and what's his William the abominable snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time to call and they form this unlikely friendship\nAnd turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them where they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking\nImmigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with [noise]\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in ah the abominable snowman it's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rush for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will only seen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and a Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable bull a snowman I have no idea uh\nI have a Sanders since book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come to life and uh you know that thing is like reading uh an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier\nOf this stuff means anything\nTo the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all with the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coached [noise]\nYou know a a we'll\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get in Oklahoma cases nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big encounters where's the Tania\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident\nBut one night I'll share with you a ... was named the orb and it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania\nTo do a weekend of survival training or on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being paid so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating\nAround in the dark a\nDuring the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area right night for the ICC but when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear\nHe had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch yellow or that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed it in the distance of light moving around in the woods now of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know battery operated lantern\nBut then they realize that this things started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd that got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believed there were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on\nBig [noise] big buddy\nHolly originally called the song Cindy Lou after his knees but change the song

warming climate change we don't want for you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a Frazier's over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they're forced to do many things that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the pilot too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nAre the ice caps melting or Nazis\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and in Greenland but the amazing thing is the uh the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow [noise] and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and have fallen off the shelves are melting away and everything else yeah\nI mean well you know they know west\nAntarctic ice sheet boat but usually what they don't mention is that there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system [noise]\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar and people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure or some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nWhich talked for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nI'll actually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes\nOr no they are all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not worried ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy uses a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and started cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion I'm so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\n... there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of age cycles which are of the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages\nThen we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nIn our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and let people participate with you\nSign up new ... ... email

this uh the uh uh most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today they mentioned that all the nations have signed up to the Paris accords even even though President Trump has said he's going to withdraw ... a lot of\nIt is kind of a universal thing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you are a half to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual\nClimate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount\nAnd a year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was the head of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with the United states cutting its commitment ah they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWas that there are scandal amongst some of the scientists who wore a ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate was called the University of East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOh they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either end in sight or or a hacker and these emails showed some very bad a behavior uh there were a uh guys that are\nOr were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk hating or data or there were people trying to interview a to influence the peer review process\nI'm\nJust I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that the scientists are these things and by the way this was a this was the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nUh they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or a procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nUrge either right or is there might choke guy how everybody do you\nJust scared the heck out of my guests\nIraq to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast\nArt bell and his buddy ... Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or what are and what is predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand\nOh with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve is Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their\nYoung to call during the day after tomorrow is\nBased on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water or the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sink Senate it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath it goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian or the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a\nCause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so\nAre there ... there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this actual thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make your head\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John yeah\nBut in order to uh\nTo quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking about\nWind bills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was about a twenty four ... boots\nLame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas were asking now why don't you put a generator on that and\nWe'll do ... you know Christianity\nThey'll come back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only way they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be born in a methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some places matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills a but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having stepmom you're\nStuck into spoken to him several times are\nHurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends Steve\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hope serves\nA are using a ...
