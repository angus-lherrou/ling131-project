it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone a it was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding [noise]\nIt is causing a private

O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carpet in cash says we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed orange that much [noise]\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the uh the soil because it's been sponge to and it would outcast and they would think in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those places there is a north of\nMel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the ... but\nIf we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic\nEngineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient and in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country\nBut the Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you to the ... are you assess and they bring us back a rumble set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of\nTheir cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing\nI'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question [noise]\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and uh because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country\n[noise] and uh the the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin

back to coast to coast Robert ... with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there are vying to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\nWhat I say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise] uh I mean in terms of manned space flight you know they've been earth orbit they I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they didn't want to small space station which we could not have them\nAnd do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon ... um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is fish okay once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and then these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access\nNational space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government at simply steals oh industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so once Russia to remain a I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nOf choice or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason is still coming\nIn a certain I mean the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think um the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know if I live in a like a\nJames Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to\nYou know launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons\nOr the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well it's it states that one\nWeapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists\nWell uh did the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force and um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ...\nA different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just\nThe uh the rich that get to go to Mars well\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and\nUm and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm\nIncreasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiff full okay to go [noise]\nAnd um you know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know [laughter] and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds a bake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel [noise]\nYou get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThat you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knocking on Musk office a perch by saying well I'm

there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong this you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nEyes and hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had ... a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo as Germans technology that help the Soviets to\nWrite well they they captured some of the two so but\nUh as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers\nSoviets captured a lot of the two rockets but they they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies hum I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those incredible time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical ah we really live and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nYes but I I like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are\nTo be found in newspapers and not in museums just a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the movie last man for not last man first than\nFirst hand while there may be the last of them now would\nHear hear well I think it's a pretty good movie by the way I just saw it um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in that movie\nYou know they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it oh okay okay ... this movie\nSome people found it a bit slow because there was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex shift teen and the Gemini in Chino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really give you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed\nAnd just the and this particular nature of of of this thing and this this this and that daring of America at that time and um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know\nSay well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem ... said David go ahead sir\nI didn't mean to you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing\nUm okay so um it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already might and life what do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly stimulating an atmosphere stimulating of life's just learning environment um I mean drilling holes that were released trapped gases are eating the atmosphere with and we have or is there any series her plans for that\nWhat we discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere that out gas out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you're a suggesting the U.S marshals wants a warm and wet planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nGood point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah high a night of ... and I just have a question on your thought they'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you looking at this and be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can ah are you are you with the government should be some more involved in\nIt hating how a possession of real poverty as it was would be more if we ever got to the point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left sir\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of corporate and so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better well if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good idea to somebody be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those colonies will fail but the ones with good ideas\nImmigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my front always great talking to you Robert ...

author purists psychologist residing in the north eastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity and grossly donors\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work all the dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy gunshot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a goes in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so I actually I actually got a day job and then I study the psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight ... rerun at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports why\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book when he was an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um you know I uh\nI have a degree in psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically ... the environmental sensitivity and goats encounter\nUm and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the political part a thing and then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a goat studies\nAnd you know I'm sure listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that scientists sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explain and goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as elusive nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief or even experience and you know ... you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several first hand account of ghostly encounters um you know I spent years just getting first hand account of\nGoing to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah an awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research to clinical interviews I witnessed the cows and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of five and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters with a book well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out\nThere you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degree you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and I'm In tangle man and non locality\nOut or electricity affects us and I'm a ... and what it does outside the body so there is a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a hurry to research article it kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there are just a matter of finding it\nWould it be concluded today Brandon about what the grossly experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of that goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to counter it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I say genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them really what did they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them or a ...\nView on goes so that I'm In size basically um fill up with the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot it goes way counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um ... the or I'm sort of 'em\nAre coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book over um what I call a uh Calif addict distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ah is a real it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important than is the person as opposed to the vet for something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty thing I Know that's kind of\nA weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to goes land counters but I also think that the event is sort of a\nTo everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghosts link counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right\nI'm a death\nOr life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters a so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that\nAnd one of those things is a you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity\nAnd when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of my aunt and she says\nYou know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt\nPassed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a Taliban ethic distress signal thing to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm\nPretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the\nGood the bad with a positive with that that's when the debt and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic ... demonic\nTeam is more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um\nYou know like a scientific perspective so usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious help to it\nUm that's where I usually when I meet them at all it's just they're they're very religious as well um I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience um and some people perceive it it's good or bad I might receive one experience being really positive\nYou might have the same experience can be terrified and the way the negative and then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of thing so I I really enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I

personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and um [noise] oh one morning a\nNew my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching\nThey get outside so I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me went outside and the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and and somehow um you know drowned in there by\nYou know dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I asked them to myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside\nBut something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there some sort of like distress signal sent to me with the cat and distressing they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences occur Brandon because the person who died comes back never had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nOf the the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through another whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist the memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things [noise] I I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after that\nThat I'm a pretty high number eighty percent it's huge yeah yeah yeah ... and\nPerhaps the bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual and wrapped up versions could be sort of a way\nTo process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceive\nCouldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief or maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards the revolution and ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more eve\nOr accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation and I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm going to come out of it goes to counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to this is not all negative and demons and things like that\nBrand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters the mothers what's so special about though\n[noise] [noise] [noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biological is different about them you know when they put them there\nThere's some tests out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like I Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing that this phenomenon exist and it doesn't exist\nBut there's some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing enough F MRI's jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain it actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low level\nSo there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for but then we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you know you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that it\nDoesn't hurt at all say what those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back we'll

these sometimes these stories are just emotional issue will they Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part if in in my in the real and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing\nAnd they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be

that hire illegals including the president Donald Trump hires illegal to really help with the maintenance of his property and in the construction trade so the idea that this\nHas now become like a great political football form is the flows\nOf immigrants are not going to stop and they reflect the failed states over there there's not going to be any reduction in foreign aid coming from Trump that great\nA stump speech but it's not going to happen Congress is the one that allocate the money and they're not going to cut the money to these governments because George what they know is that if you create more\nMatch poverty over there you're going to get even greater\nMore immigrants coming to the United states but the fact is that we need these people essentially to do the unskilled labor that nobody is willing to do because the industry is actually in this country right now\nThat they there's no way that they can fill those conditions were just the normal US population\nSo are you just saying let the seven thousand illegals just walk right into the United states\nCourse not but what I'm saying is that they when they pay the ...\nYou know to bring him across through tunnels or

reform\nPackage up by any kind of bipartisan package that's going to stop the flow of illegal immigration it's purely a function of failed states in Central America and the fact that we have an

[laughter] an unusual guy a DUI came\n... ah yeah although we can be a difficult at times I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is um\n[noise]\nOkay look um\nThe thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he is very driven it's very hard working a A N T is\nA driven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages [laughter] he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nThen you have to believe that if we find life on Mars and yet we also find a fossil that that life is native I'm now on the other hand if we find life on Mars and we don't find any evidence that it was there in the past then yes there's a good chance that you brought it\nBut you know um that's like going to a foreign country and finding new buildings they are just a couple of other people wandering around and said hey did you just get off this plane\nUm and if they say no we've been here forever and you say well where's your houses on they said well uh I don't know I'm ... than you might suspect that they're they're pulling one on you and they also go\nTo Iraq at the same time you did [noise] but you see what I'm saying so so that scientific argument against going to Mars is absurd and ... and and this idea that we'll know more about Mars by not going is just crazy because I mean what planet we know the most about\nWhatever happened to the plan's your plans to tour for Mars and to try to develop an atmosphere\n[noise] well uh terra forming Mars is something that is is going to have to be done in the future it it it's not something that a frankly our generation is going to do it\nAnd it could take what are you are a hundred years to complete\n[noise] no it will take longer than that although I'm basically here's how it goes first we're in our time we can send human explores tomorrow we can set up the first base on Mars and I'm hoping to be alive when the first child was born on Mars K. that's what I'd like to see the first\nHuh what a birth certificate that would be\nYeah there you go right okay so the first child born on Mars that is when we're really they're okay but\nAfter that we're going to have to grow on you know settlements towns cities on Mars create industry is on Mars once that it's done which might be a hundred years from now [noise] um once you have a strong industrial civilization on Mars\nThey can actually address the question of trying to change the climate of marsh and change the environment\nBecause first thing you got to do with Mars is you want to warm it up\nAnd we know how to warn planted some ... proven that right now on earth and if we wanted to do it on purpose we could do it a lot more effectively and uh the way to do it is to produce greenhouse gases\nUm that is that ... the sun's heat a they're a seal too of course is a greenhouse gas but we know how to make gases that are much more powerful greenhouse gases and C. O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed to Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the up the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and ... with thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of\nMel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\nBut yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick sealed to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic\nEngineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient and in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country\nBut the Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back\nA while we'll set of tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of their cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong about you [noise] well\nAh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question [noise]\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is\nMy guest the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy um but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise]\nAnd uh the the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they sign up no\nGo zone or read email newsletter today it goes to goes to um done um\n\n\nAll those ... year old and I don't have to register online and only\nThis audio is for your review for ...

I'm a strong in space which by the way is a a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nBut it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world and other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I\nI don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the ... states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a ... the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people\nBy having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean it's a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatize then gee it'll just the uh the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm\nIncreasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the workings tips walk to go [noise]\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know do [noise] uh and now everybody doesn't\nWhat about propulsion where we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds uh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not feel\nIf you hit the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows or\nThe you know the next new kid on the block them a a a ... you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell I'm\n... I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even\nOur attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you sorry Thumper\nLawyers to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show [laughter] like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the light of it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering will inflate yet there if we find someone intelligent life do we really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead Ron okay All right well here's the thing um\n[noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a going off the deep end came because [noise]\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people\nRight and you can even make an argument\nThat what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we get destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more\nAnd I would not undo the settlement of America\nBut on Mars there are new Indians there are no buys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there but nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nOr nobody be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get there that fast\n[noise] yeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the ... is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nUh being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now [noise]\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space helpless to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars [noise] uh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship ... to Mars\nWhat type of person always looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it be hot and space if you're close to the sun\nUm\nIf you're a far away from the sun it's called ... and if you're in earth orbit and kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can get the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with
