you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that serious unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell never a novel he did write your collections of short stories and George George sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nUm some but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he was he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things um I Am cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be ... reintroduced to uh you know a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod Serling one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical\nCredit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of these is shows whether it was that gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of\nYou know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so\nHe um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction\nFantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know\nTo throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know we live as youth and go back to a easier\nLess stressful life was that and we'll all be in the uh it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well that's\nThat's yeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again

do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restaurant was riding obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how\nHow uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but um but I think in general here would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV\nOn the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show and the normal you know regular everyday person then\nYou know a trot his family members out there and they would go through his scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just despise the the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would have but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWill an old time television tuned to a really did not understand the racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in in I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get that\nKind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you think of him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition that uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about not major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know ... you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more [noise] more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available though in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIs amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of this sets which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know so much talk of her and the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish sores ordering\nFrom Nick if he knew how many cameras used during the actual shoots okay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level of in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time but of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you a brilliant you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so\nThat ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set and the so and he did he got the most out of out of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know there's one room and that's it\nAnd he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like ... of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back under control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to be Robert\nRedford yay yay has learned Redford actually got it\nFirst job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on TV [noise] uh and that was a great great show when he was very good in that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show and Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the\nYou know spin person you know a sense a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly and uh she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode or certainly wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically are both on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally released years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas deal\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to half hour I'll rarely yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nUh and so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set a it was yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course horrible\nHorrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nLike a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very a scape is more than maybe someone stay back in the sixties I'm just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nYou know he's very here where you know as I say you lived there right on Lake ... a an ... an astronaut not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate and if the ... and ... and the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well\nUh when his career started that I think a little bit uh he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there and uh ... uh he buried not far from a a word conduit than a\nLittle cemetery called uh enter lake and write on a lake in much the love that area and it's white or when they first got married\nThey had their honeymoon there ah\nOn ah the lake or a ... a her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they lived there and they always went back there on a summer you are\nRight and relax and uh but uh a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion for uh people handle an area\nLike a shoe store whatever my feet up my store I mean it's kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everybody already rich really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of your eye he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for\nFree for people or people at the college or or local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and [laughter]\nYeah he would actually do and and you know going through his correspond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and it's\nReally amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad word about route certainly off\nYou really can't
