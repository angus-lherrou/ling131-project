take your phone calls next ours we talk about this high technology artificial intelligence vibrant Reese with us his book the force age if I were in the long mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers\nOf artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred\nThen two hundred two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure they're introducing an element of like it may turn on his ah\nThat that may be more that that may do a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou can have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink you've got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look I bet\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems may be much ... much more brittle much one better they made breaking big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the grows in the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\n... ... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working a\nHey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that were very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion the laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nBetter a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up his face up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business you can make probably any department in your business\nTen ... ten percent better ten percent more profitable or it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said ah there's a camera and it can make sure it's\nSomebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence\nThat fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending good money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I'll let the other guys all habit but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun tour it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot 'em\nAnd it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and show or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's going to have well for\nFor three very easy reasons you can argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you\nWill be saving lives of soldiers ...\nOr ... whatever country you are and and and third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunate elite alone were the political cost going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\n\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if ... has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour or so we'll we'll finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars you see the day that uh you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll do\nOr call one eight five five nine for nine radio that's one eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\nUnwritten go go go go dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back by Ron Reese with us survivor and do you think technology will ever replace pulse still people who deliver the mail to our houses\n[noise] you know um I I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called B\nHumanizing mhm because if if you just use a person for stand in\nPoor machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human I'll be interested in we only need you to be a machine that there'll be invented\nA is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of the job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish\nAnd so you have to say how have we had full employment\nKnew ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to\nDo it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use is to increase my own productivity so what ever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city if you are I mean like\nIt it's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's going to sweat thing ... billion people are gonna use it what do you think it was going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages on the newspapers\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job\nThat's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter when a lot I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink you know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThere you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have Roebuck stick can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult\nYeah so well\nThe correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of moving there aren't going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a and ate and ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet I'm\nIn that today and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative whether a computer\nAnd it may be that that you have to experience the world\nIn order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but somebody your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so\nThere are so many we we are so spectacularly amazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know of one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of bars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we are able to do and and we've used it to overcome scarcity because\nA law of human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig it knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was a language that this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans\nYou can together you know man of was a match for his anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented the nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you can kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giants civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet because we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles\nHumans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that's already Fishell intelligent and it is to be\nFrightening if you if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women enter the workforce every year\nYou know where where in such early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs are gonna be laws it's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because ah that's very real working remote\nYou know I I kind of\nHope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like

me on the shows and say interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there if you think that the way technologies progress thing that we may get to that your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as working alongside with technology\nI loved that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because of GDP did kill off a poll just like he thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor because I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly ... the time we save at home\nBut not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've\nIf if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always pocket the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm I I think that question I asked earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we'll have missed\nHe was doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine\nA fix by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a\n... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... hair care than ... than now Ken ... and ... ... ... ... ...\nAnd ... that any woman named ... and ... it gets half an hour with and I\nAm talking about automatic

bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is rebuilding machines to kill\nA so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nMake more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and they will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions that part I agree with you\nThe fourth age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are so old I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble a decision by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's\nGoing to out jumped to very\nSimple things one uh individual worldwide average income per capita\nFor the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ seventeenth fifty nothing happened what if you look starting Seventeen fifty is shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we date to scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but\nUm you know\nThis country the United states already Throws Away in a food to feed all hungry people don't world no question that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be traumatic

the craziest title called their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers say about the fact that I mean here you are you're a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\nGet out and it's it's it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out you know rooted and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization thing you know very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the way you make this up here that you're that nerd we went [laughter] and and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on a journey\nUm I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our mind\nUm but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people\nDon't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences because so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happening not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into the ... like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing when you open up\nOh my gosh they talk to your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go because I you know when this\nStarted happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium ship just you know some of those things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans leave and go so we're almost the majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority and that's grown like that and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds\nSomeone in North America is Googling the word ghost that are saying yes every two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nHas nothing to hide and have nothing to hide\n...

devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs with ghost\n\nDo you have been doing shows me things what kind of cameras\nAnd iPhone I used in what a great\nAd by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a

is called the ghost photographer I loved the subtitle of course is interesting Julie where you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\nOn all of them I certainly\nHave a philosophy about that man I don't know if it's true but I kind of have a philosophy and where do you think well what I think that happens and and Heidi Heidi really covers this so beautifully um\nBecause she did she have a lot of people um to me you know email and talk to her about their experiences\nAnd there was an experience where um there was a it was a man who was ... actually spoke to that man\nBecause Half Men like doesn't really have facial features he where it's like a door and sometimes a coat but what people get the feeling they have is just out of fear right because they'll see this kinda shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and\n\nOne man asked you know who are you and he said they called me scratch\nAnd scratches another name for the devil back in the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet that scratched out of the book of life and so clearly he's done a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory it's all it's a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit the spirit goes off and parties and the actual face I'm sure many people have talked to you about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and it's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are aligned on is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory which are pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't\nReally want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm a at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do ... to duplicate that experience yeah yeah I can handle it now you would really yeah I could which you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um\nOh let me just tell him\nI just tell your audience what happened what I'll do it if you want me to George uses like All right I'll tell him All right we have a couple of minutes yeah\nUse with chocolate left the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nYou know when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes so I yeah so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of just the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called then one night and said I saw that man again\nAnd and he spoke to me and what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what he said how her\nBy name as wrong as I notice that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of ... step dad who was not very nice cheese and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my extent that but I think it was that man who knows\nI Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\n\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's

I think when you do something like that it's a little more scientific and just having a cat or something that you think the big footprint but when you start looking at it in the scientific method it

Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence is it that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was what we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a new chemical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nThat there may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with the\nUh Oprah's transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThink you've got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack\nLook at that yeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one that had been made breaking big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth\nOf this kind of technology\n... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels the technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer [noise] ah they thought that for a very interesting reason which was\nNew you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people got excited about a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody that winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the good it it can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business than ten percent ... percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advanced ... and they are ah we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers\nBy the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\n\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is kind of artificial intelligence if it weren't a program that is something weighs more than fifty pounds explode but it's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came up with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess it's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot 'em\nAnd it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make kill decisions\nThe always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're gonna for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's good to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you\nCould argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers\n... or ... whatever country you are and and a third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately what were the\nPolitical cost going to war which\nUh is is not not necessarily a good thing well\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely\nI'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars do you see the day that you know all the entire post\nOffice system will be done because they'll deliver and with artificial male

Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made to these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter in delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many\nThings it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots they can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nWell correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes out of batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain basement Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we are so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book to fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we\nLearned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is it you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nOr the giants civilizations emerge ... so America and just go over the world and so I Do think that\nUm\nThat artificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bond will be er a by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're ...\nYou're right that is already Fishell intelligent you it is I had to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty color maybe forty Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nOh takes a seat on the bench at the Supreme Court today saying at a ceremonial swearing in at the White House\nThe Senate confirmation process was contentious an emotional\nThat processes over my focus now is to be the best justice I can be\nI take this office with gratitude no bitterness justice\nKevin I was one hundred and fourteenth person to serve on the Supreme Court hurricane Michael's getting stronger over the Gulf of Mexico heading for the Florida Panhandle\nPredictions are eight to twelve feet of storm surge above ground well that's a lot of water that's coming in off the ocean or and that's certainly life threatening and a big zone across the Florida Panhandle and the Big Bend area isn't that storm surge warning area\nThat's John Kennedy was he the national Hurricane Center landfall as expected tomorrow afternoon or evening\nThis is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nIt's called the wild card minded one eight five zero one two one zero in on\nThe first time caller Lyme disease forty five zero one for civil to talk to prefer to the Rockies eight hundred eight to five wives zero three was to the Rockies to recall eight hundred six money if you want\nTo reach out to be a Scully you named George nine seven three one tree Georgia message anytime I Need money to nine eight seven six five to one goes to ...\nGeorge Nouri next\nHour we're going to talk with a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe the ghost\nPhotographer looking forward to that in a moment we'll come back with by Ron ... the author of the fourth agent take your final calls on artificial intelligence\nTalking about great things you can now watching free episode of beyond belief by going to coast to coast damn dot com it's right there at the bottom of the home page you'll see that link beyond belief dot com\nLooking for ways to save some years you're something\nAging could make a wish for younger days but since we can't go back in time\nWe turned to products to give us a more youthful look now there is instantly ageless with immediate results on bags into your eyes pours roast beef fine line and wrinkle know needle no pay just a simple cream applied lately it's great for men and women and can easily be applied before makeup doctors agree\nInstantly ageless works like this clip from the doctors\nBut I Want you want to imagine ... ... it was certainly remove your under I bags were going to put it to the test with our good friend Dr ... by ...\nProduct or even if the if it works it's called instantly H last and the idea that it was very quickly if you get paid a ... now and then you pay for you might feel a little bit I had just looked at what's in the ...\nAnd one is called ... which is kind of a darling and colleagues say right now at the past ... it actually relax off the top and if I say to relax I found work like that and I can literally an ad in the rain and that's still a cat for like\nA clay minerals and making the skin\nTight area actually increasing tension on the skin to hand it had\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website HP gone dot com H.
