or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell in this book about something called a wing man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah I actually um that was at a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so now the area very well and it's a large area\nLike places around the world that seem to be so hot spots are normal phenomena kind of just saying you have to be coming out his window areas where it seems every image brother ... times\nAnd they take me we're okay but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody saying\nWhat looked like a humanoid sort of literally flying shoring would be a better way to use\nThe words at heights\nSpeed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... it in that respect than there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police older I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nAnd and share it and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say I mean if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have on says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility\nUm [noise] you know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the ...\nWhich I don't believe it said by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you call that's called bats watch and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper ... there were a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in ... Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nUm he sold the strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of\nHumanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of ... as well [noise] excuse me and how the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair and go combined with they the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black stories you and I've talked about that before a that might be a ... year then the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign demanding black and one of the women in black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the\nConcept in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skin is why why why I'm I'm people talk about how they seem to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nBefore they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe they ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd you know\nI'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nPretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... nations you know you've got a really weird ones you next play a couple of events which are easier perhaps to explain\nThere is a power line with the men in black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for the day but I think it's a very small cats agree\nVersus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think this happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually have employed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words\nThe may be paid for with the government to know that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them from using the ... the most chafe resumes too to threaten and quiet people who\nWho they may not want to have them talking about cases so the government may actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nThat sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next day\nWe're going to talk about

George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them how to FBI falls out putting on the one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm able to you by the FBI but yes they have these experiences with aliens but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had\nA governmental governments very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for\nExample George Hans hassles FBI file um he's extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm over ... was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent\nFor the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people\nNow in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one\nI'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he was the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn photo wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail writes\nThe you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these way dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew follow gee what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce cause pulled a a promise to security services are sort of like the the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised in the security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling and intriguing aspect is that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to be strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amusement well there were there were a interesting colorful\nHarmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then you realize that these guys telling these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally\nBut when you realize that the government is\nReally does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts panel where the the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that that sold in huge Vegas a gigantic numbers of books were sold 'em and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments um the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on her down skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced\nFlavorful but I don't

of course there are many different kinds of animals that are carved up in the same manner cattle and horses and deer and uh other ... other kinds of creatures but a kennel or the the ones we know best that have been publicized most\nI Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for a livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the\nFBI had some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and and combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you discuss in this book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he's clearly a real one\nUm they just seem to be tied to both capital mutilation and um [noise] the idea and abduction phenomena and one of the things that it's as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nWhoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that up right outside of government you know my actually it may sort of do research and work for the governments but\nAnd had the names tend to [noise] excuse me one was named backing Lewis name last\nAnyway she took a man she never could find out who the parents were or anything like that\nSo she took them in and raised in Missouri on and uh they uh when they got into their teams\nRight and that is that they didn't have any hair on their head on or anything but it wasn't a bond movie where\nThey had we don't really watch any of that she took them then they went to school and we were fourteen years old they are not going to school because they live in St Louis and tell you as a matter of fact they have built a ... there's no strong rate my late ... and um they um\nYou know like you say very intelligent boys both with twins well any event um when I'm when he was about sixteen Seventeen years old got a very bad a cut on his own detour phoning action then\nWhen they took him to a local hospital and they ah it felt like they will have to lead transfer you can cook it lost so much but when when they took his money tight they couldn't find any type matched me anyway and they check to place and then they checked his twin brother and he had the same let type\nSo that they had to use his blood transfusion lean re they went back to the phones and nothing happened\nAnd they went into the army they dressed in young the Nineteen forties to when when they came back from the army they went out in the swamp and they um when it kept listening it that there\nAnd they link town maybe once a month for supplies and so forth but then it then they had set up a ... I'm ... I'm would've\nGone I think you do lose this story before on the millionaire learned by getting burned down yeah then you get burned down there\nNo nothing but now that I'm not\nWhat happened to these guys because we're running out of time here with a row\nThey um they like you said the swamp and or some people want to have to stand because they hadn't seen in town and then they were missing they get they couldn't find anywhere and the only thing they could find was wrong it shatters the cabin with some ... some of them wrong\nAnd they called a professor at college William and Mary you came out like that and he couldn't figure them out of it that are they missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sharing that story I'm going to get next to take on that Thanks John appreciate your call Nick you're that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have heard a kind of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was known but um you know one of the grandmother you know back in the thirties or the ... long before you know the whole ... took off\nThat that were abduction like experience he's back then in other words it's not just something that began with a bacterium bony heel case\nIt's just it's just a case of trying to find the earlier ones and very often that does come through\nYou know when a family member decides to to contact someone like me you know and and share a story that goes back to you know the Chinese or the fifties lie about one so I'm you know I think we can push they the barriers backed significantly you know when he comes to when this whole phenomenon actually kicked off\nTrying to get one more call in the first time caller Josh in Toronto hey Josh you're on the red burn\nYou'd evening gentlemen how you doing right now you don't your mind\n... yeah basically had something on my mind it was a Nineteen fifty nine case of main Russian student hikers who went missing will not missing but it looked like they were attacked and according to many people and Russian uh yesterday I don't know if your guest has any conclusion to that story was ah\nThat I Am ... yeah I Love yeah\nYeah the death of a ... stories and interesting one you know it was um [noise] you know a bunch of ah of Russian people um you know work together with friends and um\nDied under very odd circumstances and I'm a guy beats remind him ... to this day I mean there's everything from like violent big vote type creatures attacked and killed them or you have sort of Russian military\nExperiments and despite all the rage several books written on the subject there's no one hundred percent consensus on what actually happened it reminds\nMe street with a lot of weight aspects to this story which I guess I'm fortunate we you know we'll never really know so I think it can remain a mystery unfortunately\nNick I don't know how when you sleep but you are you are as a prolific author as I Know when the world or any what I Want to talk about anything else you got coming up we got about a minute left\nBut you know the top secret abduction that's what I'm sort of\nYou know promoting and that's the reason I wanted to write it was because\nA lot of books on abductions but it's sort of actually address to provide on everything from abductions missing charm to black helicopters you know it it shouldn't new angle on the abduction issue if you like to\nThank you Nick it's always great Abby here or what a urge people to take a look at the new book and also the monster book it's a great one to have your library if you're interested in these kinds of subjects always good to be here thank you Nick\nExcellent and coming up something that uh that uh might put\nA different perspective on the kinds of subjects we

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you know it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experience unusual state of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences what whatever you want to call them so [noise] yeah\nIt is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor in and get a chance to just kind of all my interest and that's really what the book came along um it came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of science\nA religious experience and spirituality um but as you know there's some movement in New directions by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your experiences and and peak experiences and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of ... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregation so things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the absence are really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and try to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter or dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery in and wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time\nTo ignore me George it's too late [laughter]\nYeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight\nYes yeah I'm going to\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world\nAnd on science I spoke about this but some of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so\nYou know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be a you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers

Charles kitten is one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific views came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah he and his wife is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like out of it being raised religious and scientific ... feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer and braid the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition them [noise] is mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turn to the you know fantastic scientific concepts like heart mentioned it has a new a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up level or world to reality I Am an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes I heard he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nOther parts I'm In the timeline or other areas on the timeline so the dreaming self\nDreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom\nThat uh that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to\nThink about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nThe into the future he write these ideas up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes get talks about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually the people in dreams seem to get a glimpse of things that can happen a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job where they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one ... ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well so in that chapter sex um\nAnd then a little bit and the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slips some and and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise]\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on is as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find that a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nUm the ways that we experienced time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block prior we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future [noise]\nAnd and all of our defending future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually discussion Scott defending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's or he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it lays it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um fate and destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension the dreaming stuff he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd done believed that I'm using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know hinting and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that as you know maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI get on the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about to say on a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search warrant visible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away like listen to the break\nNo you can get show up dates with other ... fans would you do in the ...

you'll go go [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nA crisp white so tell me this in the example of flat land where there's a some higher dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to de world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us and pull us up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the and habits book a flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever um ads higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal leaves good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience\nLike a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book\nUm you know talking about what the meaning of\nThese events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences them and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like\nLike the all of us today I mean I think that we all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like Jay W done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't\nHe didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through he went to sort of like popular science book um\nAnd I think that you know that's one point I tried to making the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a\nRemote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm ... reaching for something else reaching beyond\nOur own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think a through dreams and you know in in the sixties and other times you know\nAmericans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believed it was like a doorway of consciousness into another round and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing a chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there they're all different\nAll different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that isn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other uh parents came on and\nOn ... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because you know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk\nThey don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ... I'm a failure just the flap wearing your sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat where sliding around on a flat world you you actually\nDon't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle and he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of the two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension our the of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly a he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at ... he can see for the first time not just line but he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right because he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see\nHe can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines he can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the trial you can see inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have used to say a ha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision so um\nYou know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides hum of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out you know you could see the inside\n[noise]\n[noise]\nGone in the euro

ask him\nYeah there I mean gun in his book on dreams\nDoesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other folks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know\nSay things like you know talk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream them but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down I'm as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice you'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian good sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process

completely off our rockers to see so many things for so long so many of them that seemingly don't exist can't exist or is there some kind of a common rendered deemed the ties all these things

puts them in the same categories that federal one hundred percent elusive\nOne hundred percent of the time now of course skeptics would say well that's because they don't exist um but I have to admit you know that about things that about one angle that kind of ties all of the so called monsters\nTogether is the fact that they are elusive and I'm\nIn some cases I think you know if your daily with things like like monsters that can be quite understandably feel daily way the\nYou know a forty mile long like can you know seven hundred I paid a tape um most of us don't have the money to hire a mini submarine you know to go looking for these things so that that's one of the problems we have is that um\nYou know the just the logistics of trying to find some of these things can be quite

some great stories in the book the monster a monster book um and and some of them like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard band as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically and that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so now the area very well and it's a it's a large area for a ...\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots but paranormal phenomena the kind of chase he's just saying you know that'd be coming out his window areas where it seemed to everything in each brother comes through you know at various times and\nThis was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the ... post and somebody saying they ... um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying ... would be a better term to use\nOh with the words are at high speed um you know kind of like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of point classrooms\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect there where there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the ... one of the name and spoke to the local police older I don't really know what the police can be done about it it's um [noise]\nWhen you speculate too and I don't think there's anything wrong with speculate you provide in the raid or understands that that's what it is you know\nI'm I think for that reason um you know ... that's the I think that's the responsible way to do is to sort of look at the day to\n... and ... and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say and if I got out and says I tell people if I don't have an says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say real or ... or or possibility\nUm [noise] you know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe moon which I Know [laughter] I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\n[noise] well yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that and then he's never seen again but um this particular case isn't interested\nAnd I'm In a ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four and Buckley, Washington\nAnd I'm actually quite close to my ... on the witness a minute I'm young man named Brian can failed I'm a solo these strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of area as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes but they sort of their hair angle\nCombined with a large wings um you know that they have everybody in the wings kind of people said oh it's ... you know don't sasquatch because he's got wings but he caught it looks a bit like\n... and I'm I'm for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big usually in that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black stories you and I've talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black up trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign demanding black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't shamed anything like you know they step out of the Pentagon the CIA or the FBI and I say I'm a you know nothing like the the concept even the movies back typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and a skinny white white white\nUm and people talk about how they seem to have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them before they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them by full and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper Bain using wager boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know they should have a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X. files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe ... but ... it's far beyond you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a ... as you know you got a really weird one explainable events so which ah Asia apps to explain\nThere is a parallel with the ... black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think that government agencies are responsible for me and my neighbor I think it's a very small catch agree\nBut she they the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually unemployed the elections of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words\nIt might be paid for with the government to know that many black all too real but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the ... the most chafe\nResume is two to ... and quiet people who\nMay not want to have them talking about ... the government may actually not know how many black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that's ... latest book\nOr whether or not you believe the alien abductions are real the files on nearly abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the or real life about documents that Nick squeezed out of the U.S in the u._k. government did the outlaws take us into the break with maybe the greatest\nGo story goes song

George fans hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on the one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm ... by the FBI that yes they ... they are and sees Williams but they told the FBI that they may have had\nA government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George fans hassles FBI file 'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... she was about ... and so on so you know we have a precedent for\nThe abduction phenomenon with the contact tape April\nNow in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one\nI'm with the ... case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say these strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights\nThey you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weighed dreams that night mass of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly striking is that I found a file in the British national archive and it revolved around him on my Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the moaning about to I Am an essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn and they should they should become known as they the vaguely interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they uh British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised in security services are sort of like they the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect is that he told the police so they should have direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction little in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to he was saying that yes he sold his UFO calmed down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to be strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together but has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of bemused meant well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys telling you is crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and winter Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and pants\nThe the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers of all I'm they published in the early fifties\nThat that sold in huge Vegas gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and I have a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments and the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on her ... um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced\nGood books on abductions and she was a show\nAnd Greg told me how you're back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here\nUm all of that I wrote to each other back and forth on sale with that is clearly be done you know easily without making it look what was
