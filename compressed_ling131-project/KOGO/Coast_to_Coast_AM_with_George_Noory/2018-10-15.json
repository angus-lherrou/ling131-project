thanks for listening and I didn't know is always a check to have on the president\nAnd the share his thoughts with you\nAnd uh I understand it's going to happen a more frequently you over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage it imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be\nThere will not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years\nAnd won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely\nAnd the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the state Senate under Chuck Schumer thing about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening Leslie stall on sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run\nAnd I can do twenty sixteen the only Democrat\nThat Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I we wouldn't have any of that stuff going on\nAnd so that's why three weeks in a day for now is so important especially if you live in uh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota\nIf you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races\nThat will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate\nJust think about two to six years having no federal judge has confirmed anywhere if the Democratic party takes US Senate they will shut down completely\nThey will not work with this president digging anything done including criminal justice reform reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe the Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington\nThat the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that what we're going through the past two years to fight coal and scream\nTo move this country forward will stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs saying the ss drunk and you know it and I know and so if you're in one of those contested congressional districts\nWhether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is\nGo out and vote Republican to keep\nThe house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\nWhat like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house and the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ...\nThanks for listening and I think not I think having the president on is always a great joy also Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond and so can I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American built Cunningham\nWill do my thanks to listen to the night and sleep I'm going to urge you if you're in one of these contests in house districts are one of these great Senate races please go out and vote because the future of this country is still counting ... the great American [noise] live with you and the president [noise] just some [noise]\n\n\n\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country

... minute safe Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream still or right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and in the dreams dial up a top most for\nTo learn a without a destroying the monuments or without hurting them I think that's the right way to go so yes I was I was amazed but what's it MySpace um the question of how can you how can you know without a eventually going in there\nThe pay for that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nIt's like on my news website over a ... that goes to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers\nHave a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah [noise] um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a ... view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or or who was it was very well known a jump on people who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves and I call it\nSort of a federal effect um and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get\nThinner but every once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHow around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpret it what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ah originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately said there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed\nWas a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researcher was proposed this is Robert\n... father John Paul will fall and the papers on I think it's on a Robert ... vaults or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to opinion piece in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people they think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten steps is at every twelve is there is some kind of ... you\nKnow that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you could just you know simple mine that I thought each step they were just a applied the or the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their parents with or something called they called this set at which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they ... a pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's little regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is the most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which to me I Want it to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I I think I said that uh they want to show 'em shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in a big dip her it was a star Iraq so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of\nThe of the big dip her and we why the pyramids ended up in that in the north south uh orientation do\nI

last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a chi ops pyramid dot com\nThe links are at coast to coast am and go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers ... with a cut away showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and acquaintance chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom of the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty four of these must have been\nFor you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractions tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty uh you know those courses that have a surface area that is around ... a number of fracture of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that\nThere must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that actually that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this kind of way\nYes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there is supposed to be nothing right\nBut then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that alliance with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words it's a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fractional twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth ended up not associated with ceilings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be um you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yeah of\nCourse we don't know exactly what we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a ... guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from ...\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion and the use of the lion and go back to lead tabby\nAnd everybody's talking about go back to be today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am

Kush ... which which is of course ... ... to ... years ago yeah ... ... ... as the you know we're talking about a quiet of three ... for ... years ago\nIt's been ... older than any other language you can put a little bowl opponent show ... which was of people who is this big law it's a cush people still you know which ... which are from the push\nWhich is do you think like\n... it's just been a little late it was a little people well the pilot or\n... ... ... you know heighten or somewhere in the oil\nI'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't write some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so\nSo he chipped colleges are saying that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo that term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I submit I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were when we're going back to a man as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings yeah\nRight right like ... and men is uh the first uh kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same\nA menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another uh uh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now\nI'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\n[noise] yeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different title\nUm and then the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse in the armor\nAnd hors ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after I came you know the designation a net to invent which is basically referring to operate in Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name ah you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up if I was like ... the is the first time I was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies or just go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on coast\n[noise] [noise] hello hello J. lo J.\nHow you guys doing I don't know how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener\nI'm I Am actually um Egypt turn on my mom's side [noise] and um growing up as a kid I Would always hear my grandmother\nSaid at least they tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the um\nThe great pyramid has secrets to there's tunnels here oh there you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their ah grandparents say\nThe one that always stuck with me that I really want it to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt um I really am glad that you're on the show a ...

uh the head of this being spurs and possible entrances\nYes so there is that there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a ... there was a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Robert ... a ... was telling me about this I think or you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under the ... and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd she has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nAnd he proposed this these on the basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying that could be the logical and chop you're dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know your review the paper a but he still thinks it's possible that there were logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably spaces up there and um I just want to have a quick uh cause the pyramid of course

actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website\nGo check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monument\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you notice is are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nThe traits meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing year one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely they suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it well\nLet me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramid in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always some things there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber or something and the at the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that they could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not a peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even the here but if I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Cheney and a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not up to her media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in ... a a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by ... Hi I'm saying rising oh\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... and especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph gun to bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face you know so they may not all be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it to me is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that\nAh who Don and buyer investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nIn the northeast corner right\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know a big place are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay people to experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know now it's just you know he just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or the project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and hope things that's the kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am I going to be church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going into Monday morning more with my new save Saturday after this short break stay with us\nBoom boom boom [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nAttention San Diego area how would you like the gym stern cash every month and consistent mailbox money well listen to this actor dean chain known as Superman on ABC's hit TV show Lewis and Clark and now we will stay invested with the national realistic network or giving away the riches in real estate get for free to anyone who calls now\nThey'll show you their formula for flipping houses in your spare time for potential profit\nIf you're interested in embarking on a new adventure and possibly change in your life then you need to call right now call one eight hundred to two five four zero zero seven now to get your free riches in real estate could\nCall a hundred to two five four zero zero seven now change will also get free tickets to a life threatening events plus national real estate networks gift pack\nWhich includes a free smart watched the networks guide to investing plus a special bonus for their brand new tax lean investing kid free just for a gender thing called the hundred to two five four zero zero seven that's eight hundred to two five four zero zero seven for free which isn't real estate kid to gay\nMessaging to raise ... ... am why I have to go live\n[noise]\nWhat to do about the missing Saudi journalist dining Carrick Fox News President Trump says wait and see what more is learned lawmakers say a multibillion dollar arms deal should be reconsidered\nText path to seven nine six four or five that's P.

I'm I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so um I you know one way to marry the the the theory of a lot civilizations starting something in ... uh and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically\nTo draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look on on the pyramid itself on the on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk\nThat's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and they were lying to you know the bell stars of uh Ryan a dating to zip peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom a Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines\nAnd so uh and the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you\nWalk into the pyramid or you walk into the what's called the king chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's also\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation

Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream stole or right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and in the dream still up a top most for\nMake every effort we can to learn a without a destroying the monuments or without hurting them I think that's the right way to go so yes I was I was amazed but what's it MySpace or the question of how can you how can you know without a eventually going in there\nThe pay for that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nIt's like on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current paper is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers\nHave a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known a jump a shop here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\n... rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth refunding ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not supposed to interpret it what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten\nUh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the\nPyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul will go out\nAnd the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains the theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the ticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is it every twelve is there's some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck me when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed to appear in its with uh something called they called they said that which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how the conceptual eyes a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's low regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen than earth decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension that\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in a fit to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in a big dip her it was a star Iraq so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and\nBecause of that because that constellation big paper was so important to Egypt shows that\nThe authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big the upper and why the pyramids ended up in that end up north south uh orientation to\nAgain to jump in right there this is coast to coast and we've got to take a break my knew this was ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get Daily Show updates your

[noise]\n[noise] [noise] six hundred go go [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] well\nGoing back to the coast to coast am I going to church or guessing I my new save Sunday and we're talking about his paper that was published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com\nThe links are at coast to coast am and go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you that strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there of the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way\nAnd the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up\nA voyage we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing bowl and you're right I'm I'm On this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a or specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that it seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around a number of facts of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces and war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth\nThere must be space is just the same up there and I think at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away\nYeah you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there is supposed to be nothing right\nBut then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these rose starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nSo for example correspond a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around ... twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that caused the Twenty one is right under the V.\nUh so it is in other words it's associate with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the feeling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round traps twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and there'll be have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid it\nIt's for real which we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that\nAlso is approximately the top of the ... the big boys\nI got it yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly we we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does new see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go back tabby\nThe erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley happy not an accident\nNo within references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours go back ... Kathy\nYou like that my news you like that the area okay I\n... I Love hearing is that all that you may have roared do you play so great for me to have the power\nUm at this point pirates I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and to reach us back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um if there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and uh which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a ... that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can show um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from ... a king scorpions\nAnd that is I think were the African roots sly\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt or probably from Bhutto\nAnd Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with the with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up perhaps\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa maybe you don't ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south and that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adapting uh the etymology a chemistry coming from candidate\nRight\nYes the issue I think she mentioned is getting so my we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were I think it was the lioness and her name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or Joe\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long\nOr guessing I my
