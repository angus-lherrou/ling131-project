the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you all\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nUh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow cause of concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nReally does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate and I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in and the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have a brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nThe break with Bhutto child on coast to

know interference of elections [laughter]\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why you know the president and the Pentagon\nAnd wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board\nAnd it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera um that that's\nDisturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you um about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might I mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously and I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of this do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary a situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know

Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because are typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course their their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime um they're all ... they [noise] they've

Canada affiliate in depth radio news talk ten ten ...\nColonel Robert McGinnis days with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the history of the end times finally arrived there had been\nA ... a disease I'm older patients with the Russians are particularly\nUm uh well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered or had heated battles with them or there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea with Chinese vessels\nHow do you see this or what is the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh uh the and an end times scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick Richard you know we had one here recently with the USS a Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos that flew over a you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these pilots uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and defense weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers but they practice from that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west I'm terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades and so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands without even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any in times scenario or is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got in to say is ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the big dog a mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president oh el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that\nAir to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and\nTo establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air to want\nTo cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years of very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a lot of forces\nEspecially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together you see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of allies the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning\nTo show up an even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to Washington and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nThat's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants\nAll suddenly ... it's just too rich so the the the turkey is

not do one you're going to turn to give people year we're still are very good he did so worked or wrong or\nYou know well I certainly had a question there\nRichard ... it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly and where they killed millions are under mouth and China where they kill millions a and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars\nUm the the types of values that they support\nAh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interests and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder is is evil or certainly in my perspective on I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look for the one today and it's certainly not what my country once\nAnd I do believe a United States is not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization\nAs you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded to the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world are and to me that people\nKnow you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd the western China Today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that in the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places\nUm and yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't um phrases Richard points out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had 'em for families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGotta jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this alliance and evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War thank you so

I don't happen to believe it that's just me and he was one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example\nA to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case they will you will you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and pleasing men but we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advises us in the end the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that person has to learn from [noise]\nThen they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave 'em I I I understand that when when the child is young there's no place they could run into\nA because it's if it's parents abuse and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what we're overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of accuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take and it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern\nSo we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people\nI bumped themselves and they become a heat will and their own life because of the person that they may have been if they've been abusing they may have to take them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guy an angel that to help us\nIt is up that we ... up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angel guy\nAlright Joe thank you for that a friend is on the wild card line she's in Clearwater, Florida ...\nYes thank you for taking my call Richard up three weeks ago I asked your help in winning a roof\nOh yes ...

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company\nWhere his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts group and his brand new book is called an alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War\nHas the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent\nNuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we call the nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern is all that\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand I think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nDoes and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate and I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen President Reagan had essentially vanquished or when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and\nThen later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I called in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin uh the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\n\nGiven a call here from Baltimore

that is run at the very highest level and basically for Strategic purposes and we're concerned that it will manipulate\nA the information at a strategic level that will harm our interests are not only you know interference of elections [laughter]\nUm but uh certainly and jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly now they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military it's economic\nIt's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world\nI knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they\nCan monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on\nYou know those types of things um uses the cloud etcetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pond in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of the constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder ... with the possibility\nOf ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends sharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\n[noise] I'll ask you about Saudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this\nAlliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously and I'm Wondering ... with what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump administrative should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary a situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching

want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be

Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and race and the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos set it flew over um you know the\nContested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from that these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands with that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any and time scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that\nAir to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a fix to be the collie and to establish a cow fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know\nThe release of the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago and of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA any consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look they're chalk and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nTo a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through\nInto northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to\nTake all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ... from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to\nAustin in like ... it's just too rich so the the the\nTurkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nIf Iran were to become more of a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know be\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or you know to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of very removed and I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with Assad ah there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and Iran is going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and and Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going\nBut we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia as well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to
