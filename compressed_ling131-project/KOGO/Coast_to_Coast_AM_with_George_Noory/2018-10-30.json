manner\nI mean that's that would create another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really is it that high on that ... that sort of slip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said listen you know what you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it but we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women\nAre going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent and was absolutely Exxon once and and uh so\nWe're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born ... being going right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different\nThan Gen Y ... that they're going to be just the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z\nA but it\n... what we're watching is is is a a a new crop of kids and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complained about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated as as soon as they had to feed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke\nIs they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that again\nI don't care listen it is what it is [laughter] what but listen here's here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby\nYou want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals or the other end of the population\nWhere we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying so\nOn and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just here about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me it makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible\nYeah it it troubles me it really does we not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name and listen I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president de ... takes on a porn star in public\nAnd they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah\nThat's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think or Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter sock than it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about\nAn individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ... I I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican that's based on a constitution not one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no the you know we we just take it all we've removed the rules we wouldn't have taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat\nWill what's going on with China China's enter freaky position China right now a\nNeighbor lax their their their child laws to write how many people many children family can help\nYeah they can have a really as many as they want now which is the absolute positive did last thing they should have done [noise]\nIt's it's I you know I I don't know why I really don't and and listen I Am not that smart I'm really not in ... in that view ... my wife or my kids they'll they'll tell you but the ... here you have is a situation where we're trying to\nHold on for a second we're already at the top of the hour we'll come back and talk

just I Can't think of it in any other way to say what they've done is they've they've committed ... the biggest demographic blunder and a history of the world was that one child only policies\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids is\nNow they're desperate but how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born is babysit their newborn as adults\nDo not buyers that's for sure no\nSo what what you have is is they're missing now and this is a real number on\nA five hundred\nMillion people that weren't born five hundred million\nAnd a half billion so so here's here's how it works ... any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big incomes that have been big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into the labor force and a half billion consumers\nUh and the the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise] so what's gonna happen well the bullet cooked himself because they're going to have\nEssentially a quarter of a billion elderly that they've gotta support that can't support themselves and now\nThat they they have a whole new crop of of kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble with their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's where I go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war I I don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan\nAnd that is a they don't have enough people\nTo to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much take some calls this hour come rolling in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have\nI called because I have a phone compact with you I'm just here me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a simple math so all of those politicians that have looked in the I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things Tio first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he would run and possibly when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had\nWas temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or tried to bring down next man but more importantly that man has had actually a little one still at home and that little one but a young white and blue and white and\nWe had a president and did something so by all can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did as if he did that\nWas over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you have found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting that have a meeting and then to pay a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy that song if the death when ward\nThey'll pull him if he doesn't have money we need a

comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a fair market value or even tried to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run his business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works we we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the Republicans can that that's that's my position on that\nWant to comment on ... do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree

dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that with their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done is dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nWhile you've got the company like air being beat up

launched\nBy generation y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and

Darren to\nKill some old lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks\nAnd I really don't have enough truck driver you know what that what we\nWould you like to have a truck behind you would know driver's city none of\nThat going to do it might not you know we I have many many as little mini Cooper right\nI Am a mini Cooper GDP which is a heart ride and I'm thinking to myself I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one tactical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you\nKnow I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway\nAnd they're you know the truck is parked there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store I mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is it simply infanticide Ninety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and ... that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population\nSo that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another means you're more break you know\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nI Am one of those always missiles low Kenny [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wacko is like like Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nAre and if in fact I said I said what do you see in in Korea is going to be a unification\nOf the north in the south the you know that the south is not having children\nThere for heard that\nOh you sound like about one to here's my concern though\nNot for my country but from some terrorist group then obtains new or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that any one child per couple\nYou cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their right it or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi\nMy question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west coasts like Florida is now the third most populous state\nRanking New York state and also the Knicks has become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts ahead we cover every single state if you go\nVirginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada Arizona and New Mexico uh the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million why or to buy real estate in Florida now and just sit on it\nYeah it said I was in the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to end up going to ask what if it meant when will begin to\nYou know shopping and I told her I said listen it hasn't started ...\n... what does it could be huge\nIt's going to be off the charts with the same thing is happening with healthcare elder Karen desk here for a Vegas is that a good market went off the charts huge can't believe it it it for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of job\nI go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas this is unbelievable\n...

sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an angelic experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just that these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lotta people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or that fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr where that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientists historian\nUh but uh it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rating who's the\nChief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there is only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six\nParanormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there's still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and don't you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are you\nRecently a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast result they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just it as kind of blew me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building that night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in in their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce old sol high in his latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried\nTo every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just ... my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally ... this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little nap and it's too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nButt relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to uncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off\nTo sleep or you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd uh it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence and it\nIt was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned did I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's ... there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry or vote\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\n... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in this warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these others thirty three experiences you had a or any of them demonic we'll be

to get to your calls as well as we talk about time list the paranormal world just so many different kinds of pure and almost stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a\nA lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or the title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a um [noise]\nIn our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away\nAnd he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh we were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nTo me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda\nI looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he no he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um it\nIt it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I think I Know now but uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to to appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're\nVery curious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college sure um\nWell it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but it is not good at at\nThe college and I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular\nI said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California uh younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical\nIncluding one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse seven weeks\nIn the course into the course um and ah it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different to you know types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun a that's a hunted\nAnd I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I I've had\nTwo full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey uh they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location and the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was\nOn a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases it was it was shocking to say the least but ah\nIt ah it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression of in my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nCycle can ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to you [noise]\nI was the uh um the

so yeah I I'm sure I'm sure they're they're done in a in a you know very careful manner very ecological manner\nI mean that's not what greed another problem all by itself how about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty\nI mean think about it really isn't that high on that ... that sort of slipped from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said listen you want you you want to have all the women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nTom what's happening with

uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different\nThan Gen Y they that they are going to be this the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z\nA but it ... what we're watching is is is a at a new crop of kids and I tell folks and if you look at it you know people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are up I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fined or just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that\nBut I don't care listen it is what it is [laughter] well let's listen here here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby\nYou want what you want you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals or the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying so\nOn and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name and listen I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think or Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used for tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ... ... I I Can't tell you the number of people at George that say to me I you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government diplomatic government or a Republican that's based on a constitution\nNot one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government that's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no\nUh you know we just take it all we've removed the rules with what we've taken away that the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what will what's going on with

committed ... the biggest demographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child only policies\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate for uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born is babies born as adults\nDo not buyers that's for sure no\nSo what what you have is is they're missing and this is a real number I'm a five hundred\nMillion people that weren't born five hundred million and a half billion so so here's here's how it works ... any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes that have been big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nUh and the the the the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise] so what's gonna happen well we'll have cooked himself because they're going to have\nA sexually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've gotta support that can't support themselves and now\nThat they they have a whole new crop of of the kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah ... whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're\nDoing and that's right and then go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people\nTo to feed their

started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too\nHigh okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called because I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war I'm not a ... so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the orange star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he would he would run and possibly when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had\nWas temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or try to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has had actually a little one still at home and that little one but a young white and blue and white and\nWe had a president and did something so by all can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh he has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm the I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to happen needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death when ward\nDiplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet I'm no wars\nI that I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in his ... he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... I ... it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she is as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's get as good as comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or a toilet a fair market value or even tried to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run his business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works what we have the best country on earth we have the best system\nOn earth and the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on or if you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I ... I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting\nAnd stuff like that but if he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that with their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done is dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\n[laughter]\nYeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in ... but it just brings Florida and and I and I have a house in in ...
