supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy either way

energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey roll and thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are to\nOff Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not\nFar from where I live probably within an hour has friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how no maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a\nWintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a day new people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck just about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a ... a ... right and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed ...\nYeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that often enough and the air and\nUh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they've found comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and uh yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven I was in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help\nOn the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything and I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places\nEarlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh are farther who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaves are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this new that I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an outer ring a word she says are you pray and and I says yeah and she goes we better\nShe knew one looming up\nWas like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead I was like\nWell that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb while we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the lord and Cheetos in my heart\nWhich we had these strange Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like in may\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody into um where they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't think so\nNo I I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nIt was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely\nFelt an odd present I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway and uh it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you

relationship that could be that\nToo but you know what church everybody's going to die yes sooner or later everybody's going to die so of course it means someone's going to die it doesn't say when [laughter]\nSo I remember you once asked me a art you said or if I get the death card does that mean I'm going to die and I said absolutely yeah [laughter] and\nThen you will liberated but we don't do\nThat but that's true with all the cards in the ... why\nWould somebody pulled the card if they weren't going to die immediately\n[noise] um well well it's a great question and and my answer is because um as far as the Buddhist say I'm death is certain but at the time of death is our number right\nRight so I'm In in in keeping with say the Tibetan book or the dead the understanding of being aware of the reality of dash\nAnd living each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment is a useful way of re calibrating your mind and so it's a part of reality it's nothing to be afraid of\n'em it's not all that pleasant to think about it either but it's just part of the existential reality of being human [noise]\nUm and and all these cards most every card in the ... really though\nDirects you point you to um ... ... spirituality I'm being more ... you know every reading at the end of the day says\nUm get more in touch with your spirituality get more in touch with
