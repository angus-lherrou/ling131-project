great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight Lynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also\nThe architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program hey George it's great to be back you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI mean we had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intentioned a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down and it the hit hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works and\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about peace intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri\nYeah ... and we calculated the retail Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at the ... from the University of California and she saw that crime went up St Louis has a home property crime\nUp in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went\nUp in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I liked I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our ... everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purify water healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug\nHas his good record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll thing\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the deep pack of the middle east and also a very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain cetera on Kuwait\nAnd then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live\nOver my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world so we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know is the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid cold Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot\nStructure after his he broke up with this for a serious\nGirlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had a you know he had nerve damage\nAnd so I got my my community to start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better you go to the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated\nBut here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... rural I I worked with people from from U. Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University\nYou know just really prestigious universities so we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with\nDr Schwartz we did some seat experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate or I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to\nTo do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or on Web TV or radio you and I did one together and um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three yards Fifteen\n[laughter] we'll see how they really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel\nThe free I our radio a radio\nFor

effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be your mother that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\n... county in Florida um we're gonna do something about lowering violence but we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a\nBig way next next spring um we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou talked about a mirror affect what does that\nMirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing\nAffects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nTo the participants in these intention experiments so when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment\nTheir lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives they were getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I\nFeel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people need changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're going to come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll take

just as powerful as the eight when\nNo I think I think you can even ten for yourself no question and you can\nHave you know you can manifest thing definitely I'm not certainly seen that in my own life and seen it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know\nI I wrote about this is my last but the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of of coming home in a way you know we were always meant to be in groups we were never\nAnd we were always part is supposed to be part of the greater home we've never supposed to be alone\nAnd I think there's something about that group support that group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you well there you know intending for you for your health fear happiness or something that's really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases wait in line master classes for instance when I put people in groups there total strangers and they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or zoo or conference call or something like that\nMany of them end up feeling like this is\nA badge of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person\nAnd not the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of the group of strangers you know praying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found Lynn in your studies that these abilities\nWill work for people\nOf certain age brackets of certain sections or does it skew anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young and you can be older\nYou know I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff are people who are you know anywhere from their thirties to their seventies um it really depends on what they want in their life they ... I've had young people I've had older people\nAnd it it works for them I think it's all about using that technique that I teach you know in becoming a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things too intense for and how to do it but it also being part of that group and Jeff meeting regularly and I think at that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called a Michel Dean I write about my book who is a\nClinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist so he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so\nBeing part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of these in\nThese depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is who worked out that one of his liver filtration system wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right\nAnd as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight\nLoss wait the it got back to his you know he is a way that he was as a young man he um he chi gung practice he was practicing she'd gone that Gump better he\nGot a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it will depression is special I'm a special kind of technique and\nEverything in his life with getting better and even his training you know his um\nHis trainer at the gym said to him\nWhen are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know I had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to say I have a you know to to sleep better\nAnd so knowing you've got that constant support it really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention not experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what did they do actually I mean you sit there and I think I mean what what do they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intend or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have
