are you what's new I'm Glad it's\nBeen a wild ride I think that we're living in an extraordinary time saying why no and that\nJust trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how does that happen\n[noise] well I started\nWhen I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with a closing time and the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit\nBy a drunk driver room my body off the\nMotorcycle and um I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggest that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my\nLeg ... you know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... jamming and being a good in Paris too which means you investigate everything\nThat you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table my God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand conscious embody once you were wrong I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked at all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to parents and township where I had my motor motorcycle accident\nUh-huh you're born I really yeah\nWell you tell me where cars you must remember this the the street\nOh I Know I Do who was ... was it a busy street yeah with\nHistory but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over aren't\nGoing to I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes\nYou'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road Mm that sounds that sounds about right near Michigan viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf it ... your back here my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected a vice president of the tourists Psychological Association will get into that but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what time versus the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah um well I\nDiscovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas ... book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolution and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view I kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nOut you're not ready and\nI didn't apply for the job that no attic scientists but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe she'll feel university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological Len\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he had to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important too is a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it went the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they want it to raise questions and I think that's different than uh the bunker I\nThink so too and I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Maryland to stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about this story reincarnation of on a little child but was born with three ... marks\nThe we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were website is her name and we got it linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com that makes it really easy\nFree zone email newsletters up six days a week and it was a great way to keep up on the east coast\nWe redo program rejection fascinating to me strange and this was coming to go and weekly free audio groups so much for the most recent Oklahoma goes to goes to um dot com ...\n\n\n\nI mean we're going\nTo an angry by Republican\nSenator Mitch McConnell and democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and just a few hours the Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the highly prestigious and sometimes controversial peace prize among the nominees this year the Syrian aid group White Helmets\nAnd Edward Snowden\nThis is Fox News\nOr the S.

you did you know gr Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with\nHim for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment\nWhen he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter] um but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying

[laughter]\nSo you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what\nWould shift people's mind about that question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and\nShowed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch much were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it plays in its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWhy I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world is is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shape their experience like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shaped our experiences and so we can't see the things that lie out side of our expectation and I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for

and a personal revelation\nAnd I think that's what you're saying there are these traps people get almost virtuous around you know I've done this or that or the other thing but it isn't you know completely reflective of the grounding that's essential as we live into these insights\nMaryland do you think the believer is a little happier than the non believer\nThey say that I mean optimism is

view in order to feel happy that he approaches his life with a great deal of purpose with a sense of marvel all wonder\nUh and at the same time he you know has developed this line of where he is willing to move and and part of it I also think happens when people get overly identified with a particular position\nYou know so you are in that role of the ... the skeptic or you're in the role of the proponents and it doesn't leave a lot of space for that interplay of curiosity and just you know questioning\nAlmost five o'clock in the morning in New Jersey Doug's with us Doug thanks for staying with us\nThank you for letting me hold on there are pretty share\nEverything machine learning everything's good thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that a yes to your guest earlier or it might have even been in New Jersey to us to question was somebody or it might have been a core um when you were asking about a pass Pfizer reincarnation someone or if I'm most of these people who had this experience\nBecause they believe in God or if it changed your opinion are swayed it in one way or the other I Would be under the impression that if most people have felt that they had ah been reincarnated or that they had a um a near death experience that it would I Would definitely justified\nWith them without a doubt that yes there is a higher power being called dog chooses whatever the person's religion may be or or to to to come up with the thought that\nWorking doing on and on for a reason or another that yet we cannot understand but yet if that is a plan there is somebody in a grand plan and make her who has this all worked out ahead of time it it's just not like you say there's no such thing as coincidence\nThat's exactly right what do you think of that Maryland\n[noise] I Do think that people who have these kinds of experiences begin to reflect on a world view that is\nMore imbued with meaning and less reduced to material is um I think that's really important and I think that um you know the mystical world view are engaged in questioning a wonder you know love\nA doesn't necessarily translate into a conventional story around one is God\nI think that sense of reverence for the mystery maybe a good way to hold that sense that there's something more to reality and that there are different story lines from different traditions that can help us to explain it\nIf you went out and pulled people and simply said do you believe in life after death what do you think they'd say\nI think the majority of people do believe that you think so and I think\nIt would also depend on where you ask the questions or if you're in India for example it's kind of a given if you are I'm In a scientific academy at Harvard it's less likely\nIndeed indeed I'm Marilyn one more

let's do it\nWell its influence the jury now we can't do that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that the population is than being weaponized they're being encouraged to just ignore due process\nYou know and treat the people involved like the metaphors\nAnd and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional lobbying and that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very bad places\nYou know I had to when the Gramm had a ramp during the ... you know I I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said you turn to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nTo you know it's pretty scary and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population is increasingly allow them to those to be weaponized so you know the reality is is you know these people are not metaphors their individual and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where did this come out I think the capital is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates hold on it because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record what it says he he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution so I think he's apt to bend the law it helped the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go\nAnd that's what's going to get some of the moderate you know problems and so that might get ... going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know and it tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\n[noise] any any time any one of the things talk ... support the violation if due process um we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial markets in jeopardy\nSo you know I think this is we each have a responsibility under the constitution the law to to protect the law and I'll tell you something you know I went through an eleven year highly lawless process where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and what\nWould have me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law and it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that a lot of people uh you know who have allowed themselves to be weaponized do oh ah\nOh an apology to everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership that the Congress does American apology\nWe shall see how this all unfold gatherings website so Larry SOL A.

Gilligan whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching and blew my dad and I think with a lot of these movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nBut target because you know we've lost all the boys to video games and I and the I mean the women aren't far behind [laughter] but I think that I'm a graphic why you know we're going with stereotype song you know I\nThink I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film I think one has kind of been made and even with this new car or a with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to take that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that you don't Star Wars you know and now the doctor who was a woman I think that you know it's a it's a it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies\nAnd they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of horror and five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go the movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] none really [laughter] twenty Fifteen to Twenty years old yeah I I I Would I Would say forty percent how 'bout that alright twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would maybe I maybe I skew that little higher maybe maybe fifty percent thirty to forty per se is usually [noise] thirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five really\nOkay now I think it starts coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think it yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that may be may be twenty percent\nFifty to sixty\nAnd I would have probably even less and I don't know maybe the fifth year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year olds and ... and beyond are probably\nA much much more likely to um enjoy film in their home and the trouble with going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them and bone only well whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to\nI mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it but I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual lily I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in the theater with an audience but a lot of\nTime that you ... and that's your ... your business so I I I'm\nI'm biased because I'm watching the audience ... ...\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who'd take calls next hour in addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call\nFlynn and uh let's ask you if you ... when the last time you went to a movie a ... you know what's interesting too about movies\nHow they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and these incredible songs and people were chance seen on them in the movies man Dorsey those days are gone\nMaybe they'll come you never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe we should talk to your capture you and I could make up all singing dancing supernatural\nFor a dime a single George never was a tap dancer [laughter] I mean I just saw a clip on YouTube a Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly dancing\nOr to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra could dance like that no no I always surprising\nI always ... years in the cartoon ... rail thin swaying next to a microphone I don't really think of him dance\nYeah it's truly remarkable now are they still coming up with good horror films these days\nI how do you know you had mentioned the conjuring a movies I watch five years ago it was good that was two thousand Thirteen was in it I guess that's true but they're still making them yeah you're on but I don't know third or fourth conjuring spin off by now I\nThink you know what I think freaky the Chuck E.
