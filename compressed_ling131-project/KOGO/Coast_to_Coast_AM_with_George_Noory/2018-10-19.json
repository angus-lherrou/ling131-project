I Believe he started out doing magic tricks as many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there\nAs a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately and then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames and did you learn anything from that were you able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability\nTo generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] to to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was a kid um you know wasn't I was really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me into the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things\nThey're still unusual and strange for me Joyce\n[laughter] yes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be um crafts and they'll say well I was a trick I was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking that's so restrictive eliminating you know into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be\nAnd growing in a consciousness so they're kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month in

talk to him out his because so many\nWill cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other\nPlanets or I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious voters\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhat you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going to cemeteries I don't like the energy there and people who are ... are they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their\nGrave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief [laughter] but you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about them because we're still well if they go into the light God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I'm going to the cemetery is very bad uh my my parents were big cemetery powers as when I was growing up is that a good word goer [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and uh I found myself in the cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point in my parents were pointing to a muscle am as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of those\nAnd I think they were well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here it was no place [laughter] no I'm not going to stay here I'm not\nGoing to say I was I started crying and what's wrong with you I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was

to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some

forward to this would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the upper thing a and B psychic media andme of mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned way and she saw it might that she didn't tell us she went out room came back white faced well she was right that when ... when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer I got pneumonia and I died and help build the told\nMy parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather a living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened that sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field of looking at the the the the the scalpel in the ... didn't not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to living a pack a fountain pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride look up to go some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I don't know that goes straight maybe I'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived\nBy very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit back\nEventually opt to the evening to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something like this person who could explained\nTo me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is it oh yeah we do that we get really sick we got to live with the spirit and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes when nuts so the gift of the experiences which rings my cold dissociation\n... ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are the people\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the ... moving all the time I'm Brett situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nCome and sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you learn it now but you know go and they'll like you and one day that you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubbing younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treat me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleader and a counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities of dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other\nWill we traveled the parallel worlds for example but we're leading parallel live this isn't as weird as\nScience tells us in the many worlds hypothesis for you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dream which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in a dream in sleep dreams of venting conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solo consciousness survive physical death and it was a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreaming travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious and that's all that's going on a this is the ancient an indigenous on the standing and lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come cooling might include all of a family member ... says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of known local mine but science tells us about we get into the condom information field but\nInto the ability to access sources of information on the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely a time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen and it's one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to those hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experiences papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're given permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of they believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a bad time and more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd ... which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if\nYou live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to the scent of that pie but gone to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of some here in Paris how do we talk about is how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is the way that makes it fun and as I say socially or what he can bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple full step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done and minutes you get some help ... feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our teams I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of it we let out so the rushed to sleep by the alarm clock but\nThe need to get jobs do deal with the family we think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it I mean there's a good time to back on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared\nOf what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and said no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nOn the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction but time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the NEA time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time ... future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power live this come very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power life\nI think it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you love the best time will\nBe guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the light and situations the people in far flung places feel proud of you know multi dimensional family I'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience but we have connected to dramas being lived in other

complete control nice you know combined communication with pride at ground zero virtual credit cards that security features so you can actually sounds sounds\nAnd here's the reasoning that so I'm getting on a plane somewhere and I actually say when I arrive at the airport I don't actually need a news story today because the best stories sometimes up when something goes wrong I really just what the mood trip hurt at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and I have a deal when I can tell me read\nPaste man next to me as you looked like a fellow who would like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective for the East Bay area all interesting it looks at me and he says Robert he's ... my name I have to share this with someone I was in the gravy out this week and I look at him\nDown to the grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name on the headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe that her but I cold\nShe'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head ... he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to a certain\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an age and just sit and condense city but\nAs I'm telling you that it's also an example of how like attract like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a news story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the ... these examples proliferate so\n... you know ... how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking ... waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think there's a good body is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality as a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together but when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the\nHe is the body some time seems to know things that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to to get get some blood for a blood analysis hit the gusher in my blood is boating and it was all I knew lived in pants\nAnd after that I can pick the common my blood pressure is normal and she ended up to try and understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen ... the white queen scream\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks the thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to do that before it took place on the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating the symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body also the thing we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we know that we know enough about it you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell acted dreaming is the way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams you had to share them the right way to you and it could take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dream I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's all the method of loose that dreaming you would call that ... many clues to dreaming we ... my favorite way up and back again to loosen treatment venture\nIs to start out loose that didn't stay lose what does that mean that means that we use shut many drumming in the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance of the bench is still in the stream\nLet's go on with the dream that's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stop the stuff going on by going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on the ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try lied state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images the rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive premium the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look to criticize the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dream themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that don't think the dreams in themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us it is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know learning\nAnd you and your tree is the power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a Robert we are going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting about your latest war mysterious realities [noise]\nFind out more about

P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown you know I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened\nOver the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can send out solicitor so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George or to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar\nAnd why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce the report the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas in nuclear combined let's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report\nAnd don't miss out on the ... revolution call now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation call one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nWe've got a great feeling story carnivores in the house one of\nThose botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue\nOr white or light the light bulb went on and I started to research on down and say ... yeah it's a wonderful thing that is bringing me back and it's been almost eight years now\nHow did you did you take the liquid did you take the cat\nI was going to capsules like a enough it made me feel so much better\nSoon after you began taking the council's you kind of felt this was going to be a good thing\n... St Martin I can only tell you one thing the product war and not only works in one way it works a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy and it gives me like charity care and I'm In my house\nDo you mind blowing and those people have said that no longer with us for people who conduct is a fan says but I don't materials ... than says that we're just unbelievably amazing\nHow do you know the real Joyce as opposed to being some some ...\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what it is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV about uh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate look really really bad and it looks like we're all doing trickery of some ... I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not\nYou should not ask the person who's receiving their reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you're here you should be able to tell them that's the first half the legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe iron ore yellow or on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers of others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I ... I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you bend those spoons magically if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed them down a gun frame by frame you can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real ... I Believe he started out doing magic trick because many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a they're six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and clocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid um you know wasn't I was a really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I mean now I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed you know if I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific and\nThere there was some ah doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe oh will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking it's so restrictive and limiting into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interest or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be and growing in a consciousness or the kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers our listeners your birth month and days and all you need\nTo have a birthday and birth name possible short they're asking about I'm a fellow man to a lot about love and romance\nAnd try to keep each call two minute nap for ... you can talk to him about his desire to have so many people\nWere cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\nI don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly\nHave the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other a\nPlanet I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and they're really disorders\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the feel very strange about\nWhen you say very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going the cemetery I I don't like the energy there and people who uh Lutheran ones and they go to the\nCemetery frequently our polling that person back to their\nGrave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief but you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person and good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right and\nThink about them you can wish them well is that going through like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I was going to the cemetery is very bad ah you know my my parents were big cemetery ... hours as when I was growing up is that it could work ... hours [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and uh I found myself cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point in my parents were pointing to a Muslim as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of those\nAnd I think they were well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here they'll play no they're not going to stay here back\nAs I started crying and what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nYou know I thought it

increase\nBut ours are very very important and understanding what they mean is the colors and the\nShape are all very very important George so ... you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the Casey story where he was getting on an elevator yet he could see ... and he looked at all these people in this elevator he couldn't see any ... scared and they haven't caught about how she didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable stamped and the people died\nYeah you gotta love case the\nMy bag so absolutely George reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call it power where'd you get it from\nA I don't think it's power I oh God that ... where it really is they're trying to think a lot of people say that and I think on the God has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I try to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely afraid to call in I'm very happy to have\nA ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from its life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath so the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question how it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom I'm fine [laughter] and I don't want\nYou to worry about me and when I lost my dog he came to me and the little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I don't I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that their mother so\nAnimals and that's to your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go\nWith the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go but they do\nHave a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but uh I I don't want people to think that suicide that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know so a suicides are a whole different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... very sad\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have done ... ...\n... a feeling of the threat class sent you a sense than your feeling on that very intuitive so you can feel the presence or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you're with the person who is not that good to step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I call ... or\n... or ... but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... billion year and then if
